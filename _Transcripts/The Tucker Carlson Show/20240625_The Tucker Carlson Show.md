# Steve Sailer BLM, Karens, Donald Trump, and What Democrats Don’t Want You to Know about DEI
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8)
*  So you're saying you think that was the Sacklers and the Mexican drug cartels targeted rural whites, Appalachian whites, for example, on purpose because they knew that nobody would care when they died? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. The New York Times has put in a lot of effort in recent years explaining the racist, sexist slur of Karen as this anti-white woman slur to their millions of subscribers so that they know just the right time to use it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=12.32s)]
*  And they make sure not to use it on any non-white Karen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=28.52s)]
*  My impression is that most of the readership of the New York Times is Karen's. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=33.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would think. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=37.08s)]
*  What I mean by that is like screechy, fragile, barren, NPR-listing middle-aged lawyers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=40.28s)]
*  And 39% more blacks died in car crashes in 2021 than in 2000. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=45.96s)]
*  Car crashes? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=51.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=53.0s)]
*  Did Trump read my 2000 article? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=53.32s)]
*  Nah, but what else was he going to do? That was the one path to the presidency. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=56.76s)]
*  Will it work this time? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=63.4s)]
*  So I got to say it's a little weird to be sitting across from you in my barn. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=65.4s)]
*  I was thinking this morning you're almost like Matt Drudge used to be. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  Everyone read the Drudge Report starting in the 90s, but no one wanted to admit it in the news business. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=96.44s)]
*  But everybody read it. But Drudge himself was this mysterious figure. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  I actually knew him sort of. I've never met you. Everybody I know on both sides has read you for years. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  You're not crazy. You're not a bigot. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  But somehow you became a mysterious outlaw figure that no one was allowed to meet or talk to. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=114.35999999999999s)]
*  Is it weird to be out in public? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=119.24s)]
*  Yeah, it actually is. For 10 years from 2013 into 2023, you basically couldn't go see Steve [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=121.72s)]
*  Saylor give a speech anywhere. I was being signed up for conferences. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=134.44s)]
*  The last speech I gave in 2013 was an analysis of the Obama versus Romney exit polls. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=142.04s)]
*  Didn't seem all that controversial to me. But for the next decade, every time I'd be invited [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=149.24s)]
*  to a conference, then about six weeks later I'd get an email. It turned out the SPLC or Media Matters [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=157.16s)]
*  went to the hotel and said that this is just deplorable. You might find also that the local [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=164.52s)]
*  Antifa, the Black Bloc guys were thinking about protesting and how that can turn into violence. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=173.48s)]
*  They canceled their contract. I just kept writing. But suddenly I started to break up maybe last year. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=182.12s)]
*  This year I've been traveling around the country and meeting people who have been reading me for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=194.28s)]
*  years or just started reading me. It's a lot of fun. I appreciate it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=199.0s)]
*  It's just funny though because in a world where there are some [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=204.04s)]
*  wackos and there are people who advocate violence, you would seem to be maybe the last person [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=207.48s)]
*  who would scare people. I mean, you're effectively an informal academic or social scientist. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=213.8s)]
*  You're a numbers guy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=217.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kind of like Bill James, the baseball statistics analyst for the social sciences in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=218.76s)]
*  the U.S. For three years now I've been raising a stink about what was the impact of Black Lives [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=225.96s)]
*  Matter on black lives? As far as I can tell, it's got Black Lives Matter during the two [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=236.12s)]
*  eras of triumph after Ferguson in 2015-16 and then the big one during the Floyd effect, the racial [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=242.28s)]
*  reckoning of the 2020s. They've got an incremental 15 to 20,000 extra black lives [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=250.92s)]
*  murdered through incremental homicides versus the baseline or just splattered on the pavement through [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=259.32s)]
*  increased traffic fatalities. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=267.32s)]
*  So all killed by white cops? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=270.12s)]
*  No, the vast majority of black shooting deaths is at the hands of other blacks. For example, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=271.8s)]
*  in 2020 there was just an enormous explosion in mass shootings with at least four dead or wounded [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=281.8s)]
*  at black social events. We talk about mass shootings a lot, but as the New York Times [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=289.32s)]
*  did a big study in 2016 and concluded that almost 75% of the mass shootings with at least four [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=298.36s)]
*  victims wounded or killed take place in black on black events, typically a Saturday night at the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  club or a funeral. Some of them are organized crime, very strategic like in the TV show The Wire, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=317.48s)]
*  but a lot is just one guy, this is another guy and people pull out guns and start shooting. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=327.16s)]
*  And yet that's very little interest to the democratic establishment, the need for what I [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=333.16s)]
*  call point of use gun control. The Democrats tend to obsess over the need for point of sale gun [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=341.8s)]
*  control to keep rednecks out in the country from buying rifles, legally buying rifles at Walmart. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=351.08s)]
*  And in truth what we've seen, like in the 1990s into the 2010s in New York City where [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=361.0s)]
*  people like Giuliani, Bloomberg and Bratton did a great job of bringing down the murder rate, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=369.96s)]
*  what really works is point of use gun control. You discourage low lives from packing their [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=376.76s)]
*  illegal handguns when they go out because they're more worried about the cops and getting caught [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=384.12s)]
*  carrying an illegal piece, so they leave it up in their grandmother's attic stuffed away [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=391.56s)]
*  and the fewer people who are carrying guns on the streets in New York City, the less often they [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=399.8s)]
*  pull them out and start shooting and you get this virtuous cycle. But nobody understands that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=407.08s)]
*  During the great awakening of the last decade and especially during what used to be called [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=414.36s)]
*  the racial reckoning before the whole George Floyd thing has pretty much gotten memory hold lately, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=421.24s)]
*  just huge increases in black deaths by murder and by car crash. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=426.44s)]
*  Okay, so can we back up? You said a bunch of things I want to follow up on. But let's just [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=433.08s)]
*  start at the very beginning. You said the George Floyd thing has been effectively memory hold. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=437.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=442.04s)]
*  What was the, you know, it's been almost exactly four years since that happened. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=442.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=446.76s)]
*  Memorial Day 2020 with that, the benefit of, you know, some time to think about it, what was that? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=447.48s)]
*  What was it? To a large extent, it didn't happen, or the follow on events such as a huge increase [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  in the murder rate, especially among blacks, the murder rate was 44% more blacks were killed [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=467.48s)]
*  by homicide in 2021 than in 2019 the year before. And 39% more blacks died in car crashes in 2021 [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=477.8s)]
*  than in 2019. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=492.92s)]
*  Car crashes. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=493.72s)]
*  Yeah. It all ties together because when the establishment, as they did [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=494.6s)]
*  after George Floyd's death said, okay, here's the biggest problem in America, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=500.68s)]
*  even bigger than COVID for the moment, is that we impose too much law and order on African Americans. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=506.92s)]
*  We are pulling them over for ticky tack things like speeding and not having registration on [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=517.24s)]
*  their car and just driving badly. And then we're checking for outstanding criminal warrants and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=526.52s)]
*  maybe searching for illegal handguns. This is all incredibly discriminatory. So the cops went, oh, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=535.08s)]
*  okay, you don't want us to do that? All right, we'll be in the donut shop. And so the number [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=541.96s)]
*  traffic stops dropped way down. So people started driving worse, they drove faster, and they started [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=549.32s)]
*  carrying illegal handguns more. And the number of shootings, the number of homicides just went [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  through the roof just immediately. I can show week by week data from the Center for Disease Control. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=563.08s)]
*  That's pretty astonishing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=571.4s)]
*  Beginning with George Floyd's death in the riots. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=572.76s)]
*  Yes. I mean, the all-time most murderous day in the storied history of Chicago's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=574.68s)]
*  murder narrative, going back, blowing away the St. Valentine's Day massacre by Al Capone and all [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=585.3199999999999s)]
*  that, was May 31st, 2020, six days after George Floyd's death when 18 Chicagoans were murdered [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=594.76s)]
*  that day. Why? Pretty much because the cops went down to the magnificent mile to keep it from being [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=603.72s)]
*  torched and looted. And the word quickly got around that you can do anything you want in the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=611.0s)]
*  neighborhood and nobody's going to notice. And so all sorts of vengeance was just taken on random [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  people out there for personal reasons. And then it just went on and on for several more years. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=627.4s)]
*  Fortunately, last year or so, the murder rate started finally to come down. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=634.6s)]
*  Wait, so you don't think there's any, and you have the numbers, right? Can we see them? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=639.72s)]
*  You don't think there's any question that this was related to the Floyd story, to the Floyd events? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=644.84s)]
*  Let's take a look. Let's take a look at the CDC's data weekly. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=650.84s)]
*  All right. This is the Center for Disease Control collects data weekly on all the deaths in the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=665.4s)]
*  United States. You can ask for any one particular thing. So this is weeks from 2018 into 2023. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=673.4s)]
*  The blue line indicates the beginning of COVID lockdowns. The black line is George Floyd's death. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=684.6s)]
*  The red line is the number of African Americans who died by homicide that week. So it's bouncing [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=691.4s)]
*  around. It has some seasonality in 2018, 2019. George Floyd dies and suddenly boom, it goes to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=699.08s)]
*  this enormous peak and then just slowly fades over the next four years into 2023. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=706.0400000000001s)]
*  But it's immediate. It's the second George Floyd ODs. People start shooting each other. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=714.84s)]
*  Yeah, about probably by the Friday after he died on Memorial Day on Monday. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=719.96s)]
*  There was just a giant cultural revolution and basically people lost fear of the cops because [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=729.96s)]
*  everybody, the establishment, the media, the politicians were telling America that [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=737.64s)]
*  we have too much policing and too much law and order and so we got a lot more murder. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=745.0s)]
*  It's kind of ironic because the name of the movement was Black Lives Matter and it wound [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=752.28s)]
*  up getting an enormous number of Black Lives murdered incremental versus what you see in [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=756.84s)]
*  2018. Boy, that's not even a close call. I mean, that is absolutely obvious. Yeah. This is one of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=762.68s)]
*  the biggest findings in the American social sciences probably since Angus Deaton and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=768.04s)]
*  Case's finding in 2015 of deaths of despair and how the white working class's life expectancy was [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=777.0799999999999s)]
*  dropping in the early 21st century. The big part of it is that it also applies to motor vehicle [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=785.4s)]
*  accident deaths. So you could see this pretty consistent level. African Americans have [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=795.32s)]
*  traditionally been not bad drivers. They don't have the kind of problem with driving traditionally [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=802.84s)]
*  the way they had with homicide. But boom, a new plateau that's endured ever since. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=809.5600000000001s)]
*  And to put this in a longer term historical perspective, let me find graphs of the CDC data [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=816.68s)]
*  monthly going back to 1999 through 2021. These are homicide deaths as opposed to murders perpetrated. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=826.6s)]
*  So these are the races of victims and Blacks, Hispanics, whites and blue. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=841.4s)]
*  Well, that is quite a spike. You can see 9-11 there. That's what it is. 3,000 Americans die [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=851.64s)]
*  by homicide at the hands of Al-Qaeda. Okay. And then most years you've got, yeah, you've got [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=857.9599999999999s)]
*  more people get murdered in summer than in winter. They're out partying and so forth. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=865.4s)]
*  But it's pretty consistent. You can see an increase over here in the Ferguson effect [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=870.28s)]
*  after the Black Lives Matter emerges in 2014, which was a pretty decent year. And then all of [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=879.48s)]
*  a sudden murders go up dramatically in 2015-16. That helps get Trump elected. You might remember [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=886.92s)]
*  how Black Lives Matter terrorists were assassinating cops in Dallas and Baton Rouge [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=896.12s)]
*  and so forth. Although that's really been memory hold. Anyway, Jeff Sessions came in, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=902.68s)]
*  kind of told the police departments, no, you know, we're not going to persecute you for doing your [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=910.5999999999999s)]
*  jobs. All right. Then Trump got rid of Sessions. Maybe murders started going up a little more. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=916.52s)]
*  And then comes 2020 and the George Floyd racial reckoning. It's just enormous increase compared [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=924.04s)]
*  to anything else in the 21st century. Now, one reason we don't hear about this is because these [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=934.68s)]
*  graphs are kind of embarrassing because the black line of homicide death rate is so much higher than [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=940.68s)]
*  the light brown Hispanic line there. Hispanics actually in the 21st century have done a pretty [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=948.6s)]
*  good job of lowering their rate of being murdered. And finally, though, when the racial reckoning came [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=955.08s)]
*  along, it got worse again. So we're losing a bunch of that progress. The blue line is the white line [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=963.56s)]
*  down there. It's an order of magnitude below the black line. And it's considered really bad taste [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=969.48s)]
*  to notice differences in the homicide rate. The other thing I point out is motor vehicle deaths. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=976.04s)]
*  Motor vehicle deaths per capita. This isn't per mile driven. Weren't too bad. They didn't have [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=986.36s)]
*  big racial differences in the past. The whites and the blue line often had the worst. Blacks [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=993.48s)]
*  weren't bad. Hispanics weren't good. But then after 2008, Hispanics actually got better. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=999.96s)]
*  And the brown Hispanic line is doing pretty good until the racial reckoning. But you can see the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1006.6s)]
*  black line just went through the roof again compared to the rest of the 21st century. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1013.32s)]
*  So what's happened is during the great awakening, during the era of Black Lives Matter, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1019.88s)]
*  what we see is that deaths, two different kinds of deaths, homicides and car crashes, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1025.8799999999999s)]
*  what I call deaths of exuberance in contrast to Case and Deedin's deaths of despair, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1032.6799999999998s)]
*  seem to have gotten highly correlated. When Black Lives Matter is winning, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1039.8799999999999s)]
*  people, especially black Americans, die more deaths of exuberance until Black Lives Matter [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1046.36s)]
*  goes out of fashion again and the cops are allowed to pull over bad drivers and check for illegal [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1054.2s)]
*  handguns. Does anybody know that? No. It's hardly caught on at all. Part of the problem is because [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1060.44s)]
*  I discovered in 2021, then if you're a social scientist, you want to write a paper for an [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  academic journal, it's kind of like either, well, either I cite Steve Saylor, but I might get [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1076.68s)]
*  canceled for citing this horrible crime thinker, or I don't cite him and then his followers on [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1082.28s)]
*  Twitter all get real mad at me for not citing him. Here's my view. Just go ahead, don't cite me. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1088.68s)]
*  Just get the word out there. It's more important that America know about how badly it's screwed up, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1096.12s)]
*  how many tens of thousands of incremental Americans have died because America's elites get [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1104.28s)]
*  infatuated with Black Lives Matter now and then, than it is for me to get publicity about it. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1112.28s)]
*  Why do the bad people have so much power? Because the bad people have all the money. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1118.6s)]
*  Where'd they get all the money? You gave it to them by using their businesses, businesses that [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1122.36s)]
*  undermine this country and empower countries that don't seek the best for your family. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1127.3999999999999s)]
*  Trust us, but there is an alternative. It's called Public Square. Public Square is a network of over [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1133.56s)]
*  75,000 independent businesses, small businesses in this country from which you can buy [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1139.72s)]
*  guns and ammo, fresh food, household goods, things you need to live. And when you buy them, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1145.64s)]
*  you can feel certain that you are not doing a bad deed, you are doing a good deed that will make [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1152.28s)]
*  this a better and more independent country and make your kid's future brighter. PublicSquare.com. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1156.44s)]
*  We are honored, we are proud to have them as a sponsor of this show. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1163.32s)]
*  These numbers are pretty striking when you see them graphed out like this. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1167.64s)]
*  But they comport with what you notice already. I mean, you sort of knew that when you have riots, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1172.6s)]
*  people die. And a lot of people who died were black, not all, however. But it was pretty [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1178.28s)]
*  obvious from day one that Black Lives Matter wasn't helping anybody, including and maybe [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1184.44s)]
*  especially black people. So what would be the motive? What's the motive? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1188.28s)]
*  There were a lot of motives for Black Lives Matter. One was that America had gotten better [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1192.52s)]
*  after the 1990s, after the crack wars at policing, that the drugs that were driving crime [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1206.12s)]
*  were not particularly marketed to inner city blacks, the opioids, the oxycodone and so forth. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1217.5600000000002s)]
*  Even when the Mexican cartels started selling black tar heroin, they also focused like the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1226.2s)]
*  Sackler family on like, you know, who are a bunch of people if they drop dead, nobody's going to care. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1234.68s)]
*  And that's like white people in small towns in Kentucky, that kind of stuff. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1240.6000000000001s)]
*  So you had this big rise in deaths of despair. Wait, so you're saying you think that was [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1246.7600000000002s)]
*  the Sacklers and the Mexican drug cartels, morally equivalent, I would say, or close, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1252.8400000000001s)]
*  targeted rural whites, Appalachian whites, for example, on purpose because they knew that nobody [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1260.3600000000001s)]
*  would care when they died? I mean, it's the theory of a good reporter named Sam Quinones, who's [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1266.92s)]
*  written a couple books on the evolution of the drug trade in this century, that [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1275.32s)]
*  the Mexican cartels had a strategy that, no, we don't want to sell to particularly shooty people [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1282.4399999999998s)]
*  near media capitals. We'll sell to people who will overdose in quiet in small towns in the Ohio [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1291.3999999999999s)]
*  River Valley that nobody's going to care much about. And so, I mean, nobody paid any attention [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1301.48s)]
*  to this increase in the white working class death rate until just fortuitously in 2015, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1308.2s)]
*  Angus Deaton was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. And a couple weeks later, he and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1316.04s)]
*  his wife published this important paper saying, you know, if you look at the CDC data, life [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1320.76s)]
*  expectancy for white working class people without college degrees has been dropping in the 21st [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1327.64s)]
*  century, and it's not supposed to happen. And it seems to be overdoses on painkillers. It seems to [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  be suicide. It seems to be alcoholism, just deaths of despair. Seven years into Obama. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1343.72s)]
*  15 years into when it started around 2000, when the Sackler family's Purdue pharmaceuticals [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1353.0s)]
*  started their big push for opioid prescriptions. But how would no one notice this, I wonder? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1360.04s)]
*  You know, there's no organizations dedicated to the welfare of white working class people. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1368.44s)]
*  So the fact that they're dying in great numbers of novel causes, it basically relied on [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1375.56s)]
*  two academics and who said, wow, this is interesting. And one of them happened to [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1382.2s)]
*  win the Nobel Prize just before their paper came out. So people paid attention to their paper [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1390.28s)]
*  because, oh yeah, I heard about Angus Deaton and the Nobel Prize last month. Well, that's kind of, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1397.0800000000002s)]
*  if I can just ask you to pause this, I think you're right. But it's sort of interesting if [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1403.48s)]
*  you think about it, there are no organizations dedicated to the welfare of rural whites, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1406.84s)]
*  but there are a lot of organizations dedicated to the welfare of a million other groups that [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1412.84s)]
*  are much smaller in number. So why aren't there any organizations dedicated to that? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1417.0s)]
*  You know, a few people have tried to set up organizations that speak for white people [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1422.6s)]
*  the way that Al Sharpton speaks for black people and countless other organizations speak for Jewish [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1429.72s)]
*  people or Latinos and so forth, and are highly respectable and are constantly quoted in the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1437.8799999999999s)]
*  newspaper. A bright, very gentlemanly fellow named Jared Taylor tried to do this for the last 30 [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1444.36s)]
*  years, and he's still banned on Twitter at this point. America has a phobia about anybody speaking [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1455.4s)]
*  up for the emerging white minority. The conventional wisdom is that whites are rapidly being turned [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1468.6000000000001s)]
*  into a minority, and that's a good thing. But we're not going to ever treat whites like [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1478.6s)]
*  the minority that they're becoming in multiple states across the country. We're going to treat [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1488.12s)]
*  them as the all-powerful, omnipotent legacy majority who can be blamed for everything from now on. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1493.6399999999999s)]
*  But that's, I certainly see that. Well, I think that's absolutely right. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1501.8s)]
*  But if their life expectancy is declining faster than anyone else's, and they are dying, then, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1507.96s)]
*  I mean, it does seem a little odd to lie about that. I mean, what's the intent there? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1513.72s)]
*  Nobody lied so much as they just wonder, why are you interested in this? What kind of sinister [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1523.8s)]
*  reason do you have for worrying about the 100 million working-class white people in the country [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1533.16s)]
*  who are generating these new problems and dropping dead from them, and putting out the alarm about it [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1543.0s)]
*  is just considered some sort of white supremacist, white nationalist dog whistle that [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1553.88s)]
*  will lead to slavery and the Holocaust and all sorts of imaginings. And the other half of the [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1564.3600000000001s)]
*  white population wasn't suffering. The kind of people who don't have a bad back because they [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1572.52s)]
*  don't lift heavy things on the job, they're not hooked on oxycodone, or when prescriptions [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1581.48s)]
*  got tightened up, they didn't go over to Mexican heroin and then to fentanyl and so forth. So [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1589.24s)]
*  who cares? We're just talking about deplorables here. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1597.88s)]
*  But okay, I mean, I get everyone has preferences, and a lot of people in Washington, New York, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1601.48s)]
*  and LA don't like the voting patterns of the population you're describing, but they are human [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1608.36s)]
*  beings and Americans, and if they're going extinct, or they're dying in huge numbers in any case, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1612.84s)]
*  to ignore that or downplay it is evil, isn't it? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1621.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to my view, they are our fellow American citizens, as are African Americans. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1624.12s)]
*  And so the fact that Black Lives Matter in this ironic, complete self-destructiveness [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1634.3600000000001s)]
*  brought about just historic changes in the number of Black lives dying in kind of the opposite of [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1644.68s)]
*  the white working class deaths of exuberance, that you could see it in the Ferguson effect in 2015-16 [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1654.44s)]
*  and now in the huge Floyd effect of the 2020s. I mean, we're talking [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1661.72s)]
*  something like an incremental 15 to 20,000 more Blacks have died in car crashes and murders [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1669.32s)]
*  than if the baseline of a few years ago had been maintained. And that's just enormous. That's [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1677.88s)]
*  easily the Black death total in Vietnam, maybe Vietnam and Korea put together. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1685.16s)]
*  And people should be talking about that too, because African Americans are our fellow American [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1692.92s)]
*  citizens, and we ought to be keeping an eye on them and not refraining from noticing just because [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1698.2s)]
*  it's embarrassing, just because the elites- Who's it embarrassing to? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1706.68s)]
*  Elites, the propounders of the conventional wisdom, the respectable prestige press, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1710.68s)]
*  academia, the Democratic Party and so forth, that they promoted all of this stuff. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1720.1200000000001s)]
*  They took Black Lives Matter at face value and did very little investigation. I mean, basically, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1730.52s)]
*  you weren't any more allowed to ask the question like, okay, Blacks men tend to get shot by the [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1739.72s)]
*  police about two to three times as often as white men per capita. That's a big difference, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1747.8799999999999s)]
*  but it's nowhere near as big a difference as Blacks tend to get shot by each other about [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1756.2s)]
*  10 times as much as whites get shot by each other. And probably Blacks get shot by non-police [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1765.8s)]
*  whites dozens of times less often than they're shot by other Blacks. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1775.6399999999999s)]
*  Young Black men in this country have an enormous homicide problem, a gun homicide problem. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1784.44s)]
*  I looked up for males age 15 to 34, their death by gun homicide in 2022. Young Black men died about [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1793.48s)]
*  50, not 15, but 50 times more per capita by gunfire than young Asian men, 24 times more than young [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1807.32s)]
*  white men, and six times more than Hispanics. Hispanics are fairly comparable in poverty rate [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1817.8s)]
*  and education and so forth, but they don't have anywhere near the kind of gun problem that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1828.36s)]
*  African Americans have developed. But is anybody out there asking young African Americans and [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1838.12s)]
*  telling them, you know, if you guys could not get your homicide rate down to the Hispanic level, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1846.68s)]
*  if you could get it down halfway from where it is now to the Hispanic level, this country would be [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1853.8s)]
*  so much better off and race relations would be so much better. But you're not supposed to put [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1860.6000000000001s)]
*  crime statistics like that in the newspaper. It's just considered racist to mention all these [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1868.28s)]
*  government statistics. Reality is not racist, you know, by definition. I hope not. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1874.68s)]
*  Right. But again, sorry to keep asking variations of the same question, but what would be the motive [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1883.64s)]
*  in trying to hide something like that? All right. My theory is that it goes back to the grand strategy [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1889.8s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, which is enthusiastically assisted by other forms of the establishment, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1898.84s)]
*  such as the prestige press, academia, much of the corporate world as well. The Democrats have [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1907.8s)]
*  realized over the last few decades that they could be, that America is becoming more diverse. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1917.9599999999998s)]
*  Immigration is driving diversity, patterns of interracial marriage, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1926.6000000000001s)]
*  more people who have some claim to be non-white. Also, there's the constant generation of new [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1934.5200000000002s)]
*  identities, such as in the last decade, transgenderism. So as America becomes more diverse, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1943.64s)]
*  the Democratic Party can profit by being the party of diversity, the party of the diverse, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1953.32s)]
*  the party of people from the fringes of American society, the party of people that the Democrats [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1959.72s)]
*  would call the marginalized from the margins of American society. So you're talking about [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1967.24s)]
*  immigrants, you're talking about black church ladies, transgenders, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1973.3999999999999s)]
*  Jews, Muslims, et cetera, et cetera. Now, the one problem with all this is [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1979.08s)]
*  that while it works pretty well on paper and the Democrats have managed to win the popular vote [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1990.28s)]
*  in seven of the last eight presidential elections, the problem is keeping this coalition of the [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=1997.8s)]
*  fringes of the marginalized from turning on each other, from becoming a circular firing squad. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2005.88s)]
*  Because a lot of the components have very little in common. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2013.72s)]
*  Yeah. As we're seeing with Jews and Muslims right now, these people do not like each other. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2016.2s)]
*  Do the black church ladies who were the steadfast Democrats, do they really get along that well [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2025.5600000000002s)]
*  with the gays, much less with the transgenders? Do the Asian immigrants have much in common [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2032.44s)]
*  with Hispanic immigrants? Nah, not really. It can go on and on. It's inherent in the Democrats' grand [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2041.8s)]
*  strategy to be the party of diversity, the party of the fringes of American society. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2051.2400000000002s)]
*  So, how can they unite their coalition of the margins? The one strategy the Democrats have [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2057.56s)]
*  come up with is basically to foster racist animus against core Americans, people who [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2065.7999999999997s)]
*  are demographically somewhat like George Washington, Ben Franklin, John Adams, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2081.4s)]
*  that are white, that are men, that are straight, maybe they own homes, maybe they're married, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2091.0800000000004s)]
*  they have kids. To make them the bad guys in the American narrative. That's the only thing the [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2097.1600000000003s)]
*  Democrats and their colleagues in academia, etc., can think of to hold together this diverse [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2108.2s)]
*  coalition. So, we've seen this enormous increase in just racist bigotry being expressed in [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2115.64s)]
*  the pages of the New York Times in this century. Things that in the past would have been considered [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2128.12s)]
*  poor taste and extremist. So, the New York Times has put in a lot of effort in recent years explaining [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2135.56s)]
*  the racist sexist slur of Karen as this anti-white woman racist slur to their millions of subscribers [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2144.68s)]
*  so that they know just the right time to use it and they make sure not to use it on any non-white [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2157.56s)]
*  Karen and so forth. You recently had on a- Can I just ask that my impression is that most of the [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2163.8s)]
*  readership of the New York Times is Karen's? Yeah, I would think. What I mean by that is like [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2170.2000000000003s)]
*  screechy, fragile, barren, NPR-listing middle-aged lawyers. Yeah, that's- [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2178.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean in my mind's eye- Maybe the modal subscriber perhaps. And yeah, the New York Times [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2183.88s)]
*  is not the failing New York Times anymore. They've done a very good job of identifying [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2192.52s)]
*  people who will pay to subscribe to have their worldview vindicated over and over again and [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2198.28s)]
*  kind of for the Times to bury inconvenient facts that don't support their view of the world, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2207.08s)]
*  you know, in the 27th paragraph or something like that. So yeah, you recently had on Jeremy [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2214.28s)]
*  Carl. He's got a new book, The Unprotected Class, that documents a great length, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2221.0s)]
*  just this trend toward ever more anti-white racism in the respectable press and in media [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2226.36s)]
*  and the democratic speeches and so forth. And you know, it's finally starting to [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2237.08s)]
*  to backfire on democrats. People are starting to notice just how much awful stuff is said [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2243.88s)]
*  about kind of the core Americans that tend to vote Republican. So I don't know, I mean, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2253.6400000000003s)]
*  have you been seeing this just over the last 10 years, just huge increases and putting down [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2261.7200000000003s)]
*  white people? Have I noticed it? It's one of the defining facts of American society, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2269.32s)]
*  and it's always perpetrated by people who are simultaneously in the same sentence, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2274.6000000000004s)]
*  giving you a lecture about racism. Yes. Shut up, white man, you're evil for being white and racist. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2279.48s)]
*  There's so many, like the contradictions in that sentence are so inherent that it's hard to believe [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2288.84s)]
*  anyone could utter it. But no, of course I noticed that. And I guess what I'm really struck by, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2294.44s)]
*  and I don't know the answer, is why people put up with it. So at that point, it's like, well, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2299.08s)]
*  you know, like if you're attacking my children for their skin color, then I get my gun, right? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2305.16s)]
*  But nobody does get his gun. They just sort of sit there and, okay, can't say anything. Like, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2309.72s)]
*  why would anyone ever put up with that? I mean, white Americans go out of their way, not [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2315.72s)]
*  to just go, oh, yes, I hear what you're saying about how the evils of whiteness and my children [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2322.2s)]
*  are children of whiteness, and they have oppressed the world. And I've actually thought about that. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2334.92s)]
*  While that may sound like just lowbrow racist bigotry on your part, it actually has a really [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2346.44s)]
*  impressive intellectual heritage going back to the Frankfurt School and Gramsci and updated by, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2355.08s)]
*  you know, in the critical race theory by Marcuse. And people will go on and on about [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2367.4s)]
*  you know, what you're saying isn't as moronic as it sounds and hate-filled bigotry. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2375.96s)]
*  It's actually, you're getting this, and it all goes back to Marxism or Foucault or something like [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2382.84s)]
*  that. So yeah, Republicans, whites have been reluctant to call out just anti-white racism for [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2392.52s)]
*  what it is. Well, why is that? I mean, clearly something is broken inside, right? I mean, like, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2403.72s)]
*  why would you put up with an attack that's inherently unreasonable, right? You don't choose [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2410.04s)]
*  your race, therefore you probably shouldn't attack someone on the basis of his race. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2417.72s)]
*  It's totally anti-American as defined by consensus over the last 60 years. That's one thing we're not [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2420.8399999999997s)]
*  allowed to do, and yet it's done at greater scale now than during the Jim Crow period. So, like, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2426.9199999999996s)]
*  why would you even consider putting up with that? There must be something wrong with you, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2432.76s)]
*  like you hate yourself, obviously. Yeah, Republicans, they, Republicans like [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2437.1600000000003s)]
*  other races, and good for them. And yeah, they want to blame [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2448.5200000000004s)]
*  the tendency that's been growing, especially in the Black Lives Matter era of the last decade, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2456.28s)]
*  to just say the most bigoted things. They want to blame it on something old like Marxism. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2465.4s)]
*  Now, this isn't what African Americans want to say. You know, my son's friends on his high school [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2473.0s)]
*  football team, they're not bigoted racists. And the truth is, yeah, a lot of them aren't. I mean, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2483.64s)]
*  a lot of this stuff is coming out of colleges and so forth. It's kind of soft degree majors and so on. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2490.04s)]
*  But, you know, taking claims to have some deep intellectual heritage is naïve. It's just people [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2498.6s)]
*  with soft majors who got DEI, sinecures, and so forth, and corporations and colleges, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2511.4s)]
*  you know, just expressing their basic prejudices, their basic bigotry. And, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2519.4s)]
*  you know, we should be laughing at it. We shouldn't be taking it that seriously. We should be [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2528.44s)]
*  satirizing it and scorning it and making jokes about it. And that could well get the message across. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2533.4s)]
*  You may have come to the obvious conclusion that the real debate is not between Republican [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2541.48s)]
*  and Democrat or socialist and capitalist, right, left. The real battle is between people who are [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2545.4s)]
*  lying on purpose and people who are trying to tell you the truth. It's between good and evil. It's [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2552.28s)]
*  between honesty and falsehood. And we hope we are on the former side. That's why we created this [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2558.6s)]

*  footage of what actually happens in this barn when only an iPhone is running. Tucker Carlson [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2573.6400000000003s)]
*  dot com slash podcast. You will not regret it. So can I ask, I think a lot of people assume that [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2579.56s)]
*  when whites, who obviously founded the country, become a minority in the country, their ancestors [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2587.0s)]
*  founded that it'll stop. Whites will be the legacy majority. I mean, I'll give you an example. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2592.44s)]
*  In 1955, a 14 year old black child named Emmett Till was murdered for making [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2604.28s)]
*  pretty aggressive past toward a white woman in the south. All right. Married white woman in a store. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2614.44s)]
*  Yeah, in a store. And then that was a big story at the time and helped lead to the civil rights [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2621.64s)]
*  era of the 1960s. And then it sort of faded from the newspapers. The New York Times mentioned Emmett [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2628.7599999999998s)]
*  Till's name twice in 1980. In 2000, they were up to mentioning him four times. By I think 2018, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2636.12s)]
*  they were mentioning him something like one and a half times a week about it. About as often as [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2647.88s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts. Not really. In the New York Times. It just became this huge breaking news [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2654.52s)]
*  story. And they, you know, I joke that they had a, you know, had a jet at LaGuardia fueled up, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2662.84s)]
*  always ready to fly to anywhere to report on the latest Emmett Till news. All right. This kind of [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2669.7200000000003s)]
*  antiquarianism is increasing because, I mean, the truth for liberals is the liberals have been [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2676.2s)]
*  pretty much in charge of most things involving race for since the 1960s. And they haven't really [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2685.4s)]
*  accomplished that much. So they kind of want to hide their record and focus people on pre-civil [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2695.72s)]
*  rights antiquities such as Emmett Till. Or you constantly hear these days about FDR's redlining [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2703.48s)]
*  of FHA loans in 1938 as the reason that black neighborhoods tend to have lower property values [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2714.52s)]
*  than white neighborhoods or Latino or Asian neighborhoods. And, you know, couldn't have [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2724.84s)]
*  anything to do with current crime rates. Couldn't have anything to do with discipline in the local [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2731.8s)]
*  schools. It's got to do with the nefarious plot of FDR, you know, in almost 90 years ago. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2738.44s)]
*  And why does no one, so often, you know, all these southern cities are famous in American culture [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2748.6800000000003s)]
*  for their association, you know, the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2757.56s)]
*  the trial in Wilmington. You know, there's like these moments in the civil rights era that people [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2763.48s)]
*  are still, as you pointed out, talking about. Philadelphia, Mississippi. Why does no one ever [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2768.92s)]
*  go back to those places, those physical places, and find out how they're doing? Yeah. Birmingham, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2773.08s)]
*  not doing that well. Selma, not doing that well. Yeah, it's, yeah, what then ends up is you then [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2780.84s)]
*  have, you end up getting a long lecture about how the construction of a freeway in 1958 destroyed [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2793.88s)]
*  the booming Black Wall Street of Birmingham or whatever and all sorts of things like that. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2801.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a large number of pre-canned excuses. Is there any effort to actually improve the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2809.16s)]
*  lives of Black people that you're aware of? I mean, what does improve the lives of Black people? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2818.2s)]
*  Basically, having some law and order, keeping people from carrying guns on the street. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2825.64s)]
*  That's probably done quite a bit of good. Basically, the parts of the country that are run [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2831.56s)]
*  by Republicans tend to have somewhat better performing Black students in schools and so forth. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2840.52s)]
*  For example, Frisco, Texas, a fast-growing eggs herb of Dallas, has the smallest test score in [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2850.76s)]
*  gap of any school district in the country. It's about 11% Black and 20% Hispanic, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2861.48s)]
*  and it has the highest Black and Hispanic test scores in the United States. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2869.3999999999996s)]
*  Really? The smallest white-Black gap in the country. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2873.8799999999997s)]
*  Other places, the great liberal cities like San Francisco and Madison, Wisconsin, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2880.12s)]
*  and tend to have bigger gaps, not just because they have a lot of smart white people living there, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2887.7999999999997s)]
*  but they do a lousier job in San Francisco of educating Blacks because it's such a liberal, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2899.24s)]
*  progressive environment. They do a poor job of doing things like having well-disciplined schools [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2908.2s)]
*  and focusing on basics and so forth. There's been a general trend toward Blacks who have some [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2914.68s)]
*  choices in life who are looking to get ahead, looking to do good things for their kids, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2926.7599999999998s)]
*  to be moving to the South, to Texas, to red states, and so forth, where they can, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2931.96s)]
*  and away from the highly liberal parts of the country. It's not a panacea, but yeah, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2939.64s)]
*  it does some good at the margin. Where are we on the continuum? In other words, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2949.16s)]
*  the graphs that you showed the four years after the Floyd verdict or Floyd death, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2955.16s)]
*  if you extended those, if you doubled them, what would they look like? Where are we now? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2962.84s)]
*  We're hopefully past the worst of the racial reckoning. What I've noticed in the newspapers [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2969.0s)]
*  was that the front section around a few months before the 2022 election seemed to get the word [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2976.52s)]
*  from maybe the Biden White House that this whole George Floyd racial reckoning thing, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2983.0s)]
*  that's not going to be a big vote winner in the 2022 midterms, especially in the New York City area. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=2990.6s)]
*  So let's go easy on it. Let's not talk about it all the time. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3001.16s)]
*  Then it just sort of disappeared from the serious news part of the paper. In the cultural section [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3010.04s)]
*  in the back, they never got the memo, so there's constantly discussions about how, okay, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3016.28s)]
*  in a great leap forward for equity at the Art Institute of Chicago, they fired all the nice [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3026.28s)]
*  white lady docents who work for free giving tours of the great artwork so they can hire [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3033.6400000000003s)]
*  people of color and pay them to work there and stuff like that. You kept hearing all those kind [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3039.72s)]
*  of stories going on much longer about the wonders of the racial reckoning because they hadn't gotten [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3047.08s)]
*  the message. But yeah, probably the Biden administration engaging in benign neglect about [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3054.2s)]
*  like, yeah, let's not persecute police departments quite as hard as we were, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3065.1600000000003s)]
*  has probably done some good about getting the cops out of the donut shop and actually pulling over [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3072.28s)]
*  people driving 100 miles an hour. So yeah, that's made some progress, but it took the Hispanics [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3079.08s)]
*  while longer to get the word that the cops weren't being proactive. So their car crash [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3089.56s)]
*  and murder rates have gone way up. Even if things are getting better now, they're going to take [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3097.7999999999997s)]
*  number of years to get back to where we were in 2019, much less where we were before Ferguson in [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3105.48s)]
*  2014. The death rate is still up like in these deaths of exuberance, like 30 to 40% over 2014. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3112.12s)]
*  And way up over the non-black average. So the obvious question is like, why? And this has been [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3122.3599999999997s)]
*  going on a long time. Has there ever been a serious effort made in good faith to figure out why rates [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3129.48s)]
*  of violence in black areas are so much higher, which they are and have always been? But why? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3138.36s)]
*  Yeah, people have been studying it for the longest time. Time Magazine ran an article in the late [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3144.28s)]
*  50s about the biggest worry of big city mayors is the growing problem of black crime. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3155.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, at this point, cities have done, we went through a bunch of phases. We liberalized the [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3162.52s)]
*  country in the 60s and the Warren Court years. We cut the imprisonment times and so forth. And that [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3172.3599999999997s)]
*  wound up doubling the per capita murder rate in the 60s and 70s. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3181.3199999999997s)]
*  It doubled? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3186.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was by 1980. It was twice what it was in 1961 per capita. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3187.8s)]
*  That's a lot of dead people. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3194.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of dead people. And it did horrors to American urban life. People fled to [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3196.1200000000003s)]
*  the suburbs. They're all now denounced as these villains who engaged in white flight. But, you [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3205.96s)]
*  know, like my wife's family lived in the Austin neighborhood in the west side of Chicago. And they, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3212.6s)]
*  when it started to integrate, they joined a liberal Catholic group and said, okay, we're [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3221.72s)]
*  all going to stick it out and make integration work. And we're not going to flee to the suburbs. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3226.12s)]
*  And my in-laws stuck it out three years longer than the rest of the members of the club did. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3233.64s)]
*  But at that point, the number of felonies against their children was piling up. And so they finally [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3240.8399999999997s)]
*  sold out at a loss of like half of what they could have gotten for their house if they'd sold it [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3246.52s)]
*  three years before. Tens of millions of people- [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3253.0s)]
*  Did that change their views? What a tragedy for them. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3256.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know, my late father-in-law was the tuba player for the Chicago Lyric [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3258.92s)]
*  Opera. So he ended up buying a farm 63 miles out of town and then commuting to work to play the tuba [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3266.84s)]
*  in the opera house downtown. Yeah, it was kind of a disaster for them. And, you know, there's [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3275.2400000000002s)]
*  tens of millions of Americans who are still alive who can tell these stories of what actually [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3282.84s)]
*  happened. And the media is not that interested in hearing them. You know, the media wants to [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3288.92s)]
*  portray these people as the bad guys who, because of their bigotry and not because of all the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3295.8s)]
*  felonies against their children, you know, moved out to the suburbs. Interestingly, right across [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3302.76s)]
*  the street from where my in-laws lived is the municipality of Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb that [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3310.6000000000004s)]
*  Ernest Hemingway supposedly said was the land of broad lawns and narrow mines. But it's really [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3320.92s)]
*  nice, has all this great Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. They actually did something [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3326.76s)]
*  really intelligent and really illegal in the 1970s, which was they put a racial quota on [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3332.04s)]
*  real estate agents. It was called the Black a Block Club and said, no, you can't make a [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3339.56s)]
*  huge fast windfall by terrifying everybody into selling right now. And because it's going to, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3346.92s)]
*  the whole block is going to tip black. You're going to do this in an orderly fashion and we're [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3355.0s)]
*  going to use a racial quota. And it worked. It kept Oak Park from going all black the way the [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3361.4s)]
*  Austin neighborhood next door has gone and Austin just is bleak. It's kind of post-apocalyptic [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3371.32s)]
*  looking now. And Oak Park looks kind of like this gay utopia for older gay couples who like fixing up [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3377.88s)]
*  beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright houses. So, you know, liberals did some things to protect themselves, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3386.28s)]
*  but they just didn't tell anybody about it. So- [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3395.72s)]
*  Was anyone ever held responsible for any of this? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3401.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, if you read the press, yeah, there's been huge condemnation for all the white families [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3406.2s)]
*  that fled crime as that they're engaging in white flight. And if their grandchildren move back to [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3419.8s)]
*  the city, because the crime has come down a little, then they're engaging in the great crime of [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3426.6000000000004s)]
*  gentrification. You know, it's kind of can't win, can't, you know, either way you lose. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3431.88s)]
*  You know, there's all sorts of talk, you know, Mayor Pete in the transportation department's [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3441.16s)]
*  always denouncing racist roads, that building highways was destroying black neighborhoods and [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3449.8799999999997s)]
*  so forth. You know, we've rewritten the past over and over again. So we don't learn anything from it [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3456.6s)]
*  because we just specify a few important, a few things that fit this narrative that everybody has [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3466.28s)]
*  now. So, you know, we'll see. I mean, the obvious goal is what they call equity. And the term equity [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3474.2000000000003s)]
*  is one of those words. It's not a secret what the DEI people want when they specify equity. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3488.52s)]
*  What they're talking about when they're talking about equity and generational wealth and so forth [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3496.6800000000003s)]
*  is they want your equity in your home, and they want to tax it away and take it as reparations [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3501.7200000000003s)]
*  and spend it on themselves. And that's kind of the bottom line. Whether that'll get carried out, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3509.88s)]
*  we've seen reparation programs start to put out checks in super liberal places like Evanston, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3518.44s)]
*  Illinois, even in California, the idea of handing out huge checks to black people for the horrors [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3523.96s)]
*  of living in California didn't go that well. We have too large a Hispanic population. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3532.52s)]
*  Yeah. But can I ask how exactly would the DEI community steal the equity out of your home? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3540.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, one start has been to reopen ancient history. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3548.6800000000003s)]
*  What do you call it when the government condemns your property and sells it and buys it for what [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3561.4s)]
*  it thinks it's worth? We've seen cases. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3566.92s)]
*  Eminent domain? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3570.36s)]
*  Yeah, eminent domain cases from a century ago. So if you're black and you happen to have a family [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3571.08s)]
*  legend that we used to own this really nice piece of property, but then it got eminently [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3581.7999999999997s)]
*  domain to make into a park, that was racist and we should get that property back. So [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3586.52s)]
*  the descendants of a black family in Manhattan Beach recently, who Manhattan Beach had condemned [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3592.04s)]
*  their property and a few other and some white neighbors of theirs to build a park. And they [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3601.8s)]
*  recently got the city council to declare that that was racist in 1928. And that if it wasn't for this, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3608.6800000000003s)]
*  it wasn't for this, they no doubt would have held onto the property through the depression, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3617.48s)]
*  through everything that's happened ever since. They would have scrimped and saved to hold onto [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3623.0s)]
*  that land next to the beach, which is now worth $20 million. So they got a check for $20 million [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3629.2400000000002s)]
*  for that. You'll see, you know, this is a general trend that's speeding up as [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3637.7200000000003s)]
*  the plaintiffs' attorneys are looking for these old cases. And, you know, it's not like they can [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3645.32s)]
*  re-litigate the case because there's nobody alive that remembers, that can testify or anything like [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3651.48s)]
*  that. So there'll be lots of attempts like that to, you know, basically hand out large amounts of [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3658.6s)]
*  money. And maybe it won't be called reparations, but you'll see this. And it's definitely been [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3667.72s)]
*  increasing in the 2020s. But doesn't demographic change, driven by immigration, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3678.04s)]
*  scramble the formula a little bit? So you're, I'm 55, you're older than I am by a bit, but we both [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3683.56s)]
*  grew up in a country where, you know, it was white majority, black minority. And with some, we're from [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3691.0s)]
*  California, both of us. So there was always a Hispanic component. But I think most Americans [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3696.92s)]
*  sort of thought of it as a white country with a black minority, a mistreated black minority. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3702.84s)]
*  In some cases, that was true. But that's not the country that we're in right now. And it definitely [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3706.52s)]
*  is not the country we're going to be in in 10 years, which is going to have a Hispanic majority, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3712.92s)]
*  a white minority, and then a much, much, much smaller black minority. So I just wonder if the [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3717.4s)]
*  Hispanic majority is going to be that interested in Emmett Till. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3722.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's, yeah, that's definitely a possibility. And the establishment is working [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3726.2s)]
*  hard on that to inculcate in the public schools that Emmett Till is the most important figure [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3737.88s)]
*  of the 20th century. They're working very hard to keep together the Democratic coalition of the [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3746.28s)]
*  fringes by pointing at these horrible white men who are the enemy, and who also have all the [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3756.76s)]
*  generational wealth and keep your eye on the prize, eyes on the prize. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3764.76s)]
*  Which is other people's money. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3770.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, other people's money. It's white people's home equity, basically, in stocks. Baby boomers [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3771.56s)]
*  are dying. They want to leave their property to their kids. This is a vast turnover of wealth. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3778.92s)]
*  We need to get our hands on some of this. Another question might be, how big is the African [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3787.16s)]
*  immigration going to be? If you look at the border, there's all sorts of people showing up [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3795.8s)]
*  from Mauritania, from all sorts of places. In recent years, all over the world, the fertility [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3802.36s)]
*  rates are plummeting, except they're still way above reproduction rate in most of Africa. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3810.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3820.6s)]
*  People know how to get out of Africa now. You get a smartphone, it gives you all the instructions, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3824.84s)]
*  and so forth. Why not move somewhere nicer? Europe's getting much more African, and America is, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3829.88s)]
*  too, at this point. The descendants of American slaves are losing out on their affirmative action, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3846.6s)]
*  and so forth. Twenty years ago, two Harvard African American studies professors pointed out [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3857.56s)]
*  that a huge fraction of the affirmative action spots at Harvard seem to be reserved either for [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3868.12s)]
*  foreign elites whose parents are foreign minister of Ghana or something like that, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3875.08s)]
*  or have one white parent, or like in the case of the Obama family, it's now a three-generation [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3884.84s)]
*  Harvard family, both privileges. Not many positions at Harvard go to descendants of American slaves, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3890.7599999999998s)]
*  the way Michelle Obama is clearly a highly legitimate descendant of American slaves, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3901.24s)]
*  and Barack, man, not at all. But yeah, we'll see that. American corporations, they want, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3908.2s)]
*  if they have to meet DEI quotas, they tend to prefer immigrants for the jobs, or people [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3919.16s)]
*  maybe who are raised by their white mothers, or something like that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3927.9599999999996s)]
*  So we'll see where this all leads to. Where does it all go politically? Well, actually, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3932.3599999999997s)]
*  let me just take a step back. You became famous to the extent that you were famous in sort of a [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3938.52s)]
*  Samus Dot kind of way, 2016, for calling that election with some accuracy based on looking [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3945.3999999999996s)]
*  at the demographics. Tell us about your predictions. Yeah, I mean, that's a kind [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3953.0s)]
*  overstatement. But it's more like in 2000, I became the most outspoken critic of the new GOP [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3960.68s)]
*  orthodoxy as promulgated by Karl Rove, George W. Bush's Svangali. And Rove's theory was [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3971.56s)]
*  that what we need, what the Republicans need is to push through amnesty and much easier immigration. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3979.6400000000003s)]
*  And that's what the Latino voters or future Latino voters will, they'll love us for that, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3990.36s)]
*  for bringing in fellow Latinos. And then they'll all switch to voting Republican, especially for [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=3998.6000000000004s)]
*  the Bush family, which, you know, that Jeb's son, George P. Bush, is half Mexican. And so there's a [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4009.6400000000003s)]
*  future as the United States and Mexico demographically merge, the Bush dynasty of wasps and Mexicans will [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4020.1200000000003s)]
*  carry on as the natural ruling class of increasingly Mestizo North America. And that's [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4028.92s)]
*  that wasn't too implausible. But I kept asking questions like, do Latinos really care [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4039.56s)]
*  and that much about immigration policy? Are you sure they really want all their cousins from [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4048.28s)]
*  back home to be moving in with them? The one close Latino state is Florida. And do the Cubans in [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4054.92s)]
*  Florida really care about Mexicans, illegal alien Mexicans? I haven't noticed that. And [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4063.08s)]
*  I kept saying, you know, an awful lot of Latinos are in California, and that's never going to go [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4070.44s)]
*  Republic again. And the others are in Texas in large numbers. And if that goes, if that's up for [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4076.44s)]
*  play, then the Republican Party is in really big trouble. So wouldn't it make more sense looking [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4083.72s)]
*  at the electoral college map to go, well, look, there's all these Great Lakes states, the rust [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4089.16s)]
*  belt. And one of the things you see there is that the white working class isn't anywhere near as [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4095.0s)]
*  Republican as they are in the south. And they're actually really close in the electoral college, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4101.48s)]
*  Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. So why not do things for the white working class in the north [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4108.12s)]
*  and such as limiting immigration so that, you know, they can continue to be paid pretty well [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4116.28s)]
*  and focus on them? And yeah, that's, and the Republican establishment kept going on with the [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4125.4s)]
*  Hispanic plan. That was the big 2013 audit that convinced Marco Rubio that we need amnesty and so [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4132.2s)]
*  forth. But I kept saying, yeah, you know, the way you win in the electoral college is these [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4141.88s)]
*  rust belt states around the Great Lakes. Did Roeve not see that? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4149.56s)]
*  I mean, for his loyalty to the Bush dynasty, I really think George P. Bush played a huge role [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4157.72s)]
*  in the Bush family's thinking that because Jeb had married into a Mexican family, that this gave [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4168.12s)]
*  the Bushes out of all the Wasp dynasties in the United States, the greatest chance to exploit [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4177.64s)]
*  the immigration wave from Latin America and to be the natural rulers of a Mexicanized population. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4186.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, George H.W. Bush had 10-year-old George P. Bush read the Declaration of Independence [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4197.16s)]
*  at the 1988 Republican Convention, which was a big deal because the Democratic candidate had been [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4205.08s)]
*  unenthusiastic about the Pledge of Allegiance and so forth. So, you know, George H.W. was putting his, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4212.68s)]
*  what he called his little brown one up there on national television. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4220.04s)]
*  The LBO. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4223.48s)]
*  Yeah, to get that started. So, yeah, it made sense to Roeve. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4224.44s)]
*  You got the sense that the more you listen to Roeve that maybe he wasn't the genius [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4231.48s)]
*  we were told he was. Yeah. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4235.96s)]
*  You know, yeah, he won an election. Yeah, he won a couple of elections for George W. Bush. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4240.679999999999s)]
*  But, yeah, is he this genius? Nah. But, you know, the Republicans weren't, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4249.48s)]
*  didn't, you know, didn't have a whole lot of people who crunched numbers and spreadsheets. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4258.28s)]
*  So, in the first decade of the century, I spent a lot of time analyzing spreadsheets and so forth [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4263.64s)]
*  of election totals and going, you know, it looks like there's a different path here. And it really [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4270.6s)]
*  runs through the North Central region where white working class people vote about 50-50, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4275.64s)]
*  Republican and Democrat, and you can get that up to 55-60%. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4284.12s)]
*  You know, you can win a lot of electoral votes. So, did Trump read my 2000 article? Nah. But [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4288.360000000001s)]
*  what else was he going to do? That was the one path to the presidency. You know, it almost [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4298.280000000001s)]
*  worked again in 2020 under pretty adverse circumstances. So- Will it work this time? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4304.76s)]
*  I don't know. I've given up making predictions. I mean, people came along like Nate Silver, who just [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4314.12s)]
*  was so much more interested in predicting elections and worked so much harder at it. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4322.04s)]
*  That was like, I don't have that gambling instinct that Nate does. And, you know, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4328.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm going to retire from making predictions. I don't see myself as a great forecaster of [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4337.48s)]
*  the future. What I try to be is a historian of the present and notice things that are happening [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4342.599999999999s)]
*  right now. So, what is happening with Hispanic voters? In Texas, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4348.839999999999s)]
*  it definitely seemed like the racial reckoning of 2020 when the Democrats went basically nuts over [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4355.24s)]
*  blacks alienated quite a few Texas Latino Democrats. In California, less clear. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4366.04s)]
*  Does it even matter? I mean, California is not much of a democracy at this point. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4378.84s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't matter. It's helpful in Texas in that the Republicans will basically lose the [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4381.64s)]
*  White House forever when Texas flips blue. The good news in Texas is that basically they have a pretty, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4390.12s)]
*  they have a pretty strong, loyal, steadfast Republican white population. A lot of the [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4401.96s)]
*  advantages of Texas are that they're not tied into guilt over the South. They were a Confederate [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4410.04s)]
*  state, but they don't care about that. They care about the Alamo. They've got this whole national [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4416.36s)]
*  narrative and it helps keep them safe. And so, I think that's a good thing. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4421.4800000000005s)]
*  And it helps keep them together. And they provide strong leadership for Hispanics. And Hispanics are [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4428.679999999999s)]
*  less domineering than people were talking about in the past. They kind of look around at their [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4439.08s)]
*  upper middle class neighbors and go, oh, okay, what are you doing? Oh, you're a Republican. Okay, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4446.28s)]
*  that sounds pretty cool. I might be a Republican too. California, the upper middle classes [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4451.5599999999995s)]
*  Democratic, so the Hispanics follow that lead. So, I can't tell exactly where it'll go. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4458.28s)]
*  How does Trump change that? I mean, it feels anecdotally like a lot of [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4468.68s)]
*  Latin American immigrants like Trump. Yeah. I mean, what Trump has done is he's taken the [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4475.56s)]
*  appeal of the Republican party downscale compared to say Mitt Romney. Mitt did a pretty good job of [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4482.12s)]
*  holding on to suburban upper middle class, the frequent flyer population, corporate executives, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4492.36s)]
*  and things like that. They feel one with him. Trump is picking up working class people of all races. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4500.44s)]
*  That's good, but it also is kind of taking the Republican party downscale intellectually. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4509.4s)]
*  You're getting more dumb conspiracy theories out of Republicans, et cetera. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4519.08s)]
*  I mean, a big question is how much is this totally Trump's personality? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4524.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, 2020, 2024, it looked like Ron DeSantis had studied Trump and said, okay, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4552.12s)]
*  Trump's got some interesting new ideas, some post Romney ideas, and I'm the competent, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4560.84s)]
*  well-educated guy who reads all the fine print, and I can implement some of these. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4569.160000000001s)]
*  And that didn't seem like a bad pitch, but just didn't go over it all. As soon as the Democrats [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4575.24s)]
*  started arresting Trump for all sorts of charges, then that helped solve the Democratic nightmare [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4585.16s)]
*  that the Republicans were going to nominate a competent 40-something to run against their [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4596.5199999999995s)]
*  octogenarian incumbent. And so now we were stuck with a rerun of 2020. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4602.04s)]
*  So you think that's what it was? It was the legal persecution of Trump. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4609.32s)]
*  It seemed like that blunted DeSantis, and basically Republicans went back to Trump and went like, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4614.76s)]
*  well, if the Democrats are going to do that, then we're going to stand by Trump. And, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4621.48s)]
*  you know, arresting a major candidate is un-American. It's totally [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4625.8s)]
*  shameful in the United States history. And the Democrats didn't get in the way and go like, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4637.64s)]
*  oh, let's not do that. They let local politicians, you know, kind of run amok like this New York case. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4644.68s)]
*  And so they got the nominee they wanted, Donald Trump. But now they're real worried that they're [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4653.320000000001s)]
*  going to get the president they don't want, Donald Trump. So we shall see. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4661.8s)]
*  So the reason that you've emerged from your cave in Toribora, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4668.68s)]
*  is because you've got a book. It's a beautiful looking book. And it's collected [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4674.6s)]
*  journalism 1973 to 2023. You don't look that old. But it's called Noticing. What does that mean? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4681.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'll hold it up here. I mean, it's a slogan that I took from the [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4691.24s)]
*  George Orwell who said that to see what's in front of one's nose takes a constant effort. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4699.72s)]
*  And I'm trying to make it easier for people to notice the realities that they see around them. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4707.8s)]
*  And to understand that what they see with their own lying eyes in their daily life, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4715.72s)]
*  is also actually validated by the best of the social sciences. And that there aren't these two [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4724.76s)]
*  different realms of existence, this kind of tawdry sublunary one where we make decisions about what [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4734.04s)]
*  neighborhoods our family should live in and what's what are good schools for the kids. And then [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4742.52s)]
*  this higher more realm of the science. The world of data. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4749.32s)]
*  Yeah, the world of data that proves that all those things you notice in your daily life can't possibly [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4754.28s)]
*  be true, because then that would be a stereotype. And my view is not all connected. There's just [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4762.04s)]
*  one reality out there. It goes from your personal anecdotes to your personal personal experience. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4768.28s)]
*  And it all tells pretty much the same story. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4776.12s)]
*  So, but why is it I mean, we don't need to get into COVID. But I just noticed from the very beginning, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4779.56s)]
*  I never, you know, do you know anyone who died of COVID? Do you know anyone? Like, actually, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4784.52s)]
*  no one. Have you a dinner with anyone who later died of COVID? Do you know anyone who was [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4788.52s)]
*  injured by the facts? And I don't think I've ever met a single person who didn't have the same [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4791.8s)]
*  answer I did. And I think that's the only reason why I'm so happy to be here. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4795.72s)]
*  I don't think I've ever met a single person who didn't have the same answer I did. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4800.68s)]
*  Whether that's reality or not, I still don't know. But I do know there's been such an effort to tell [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4805.72s)]
*  me that I'm crazy for noticing that. Yeah, one one thing I used to do was go through [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4810.28s)]
*  the list of Wikipedia prominent people who have died of COVID. And the thing I noticed about it [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4817.32s)]
*  was that they were almost all people who were no longer in their primes. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4827.320000000001s)]
*  That, oh, like I saw like, oh, baseball pitcher, Hall of Famer, Tom Seavers died at age 74 of [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4836.4400000000005s)]
*  COVID. And then I looked up a little more about him and like, well, you know, he probably would [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4843.96s)]
*  had another good couple decades going to old timers games and stuff like that. But then it [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4850.360000000001s)]
*  turned out that he dropped out of public life the year before because he had dementia and. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4856.12s)]
*  Parkinson's. Yeah. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4863.56s)]
*  Just general, he didn't have a good life ahead of him. And so I think that's one of the things [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4865.16s)]
*  that was going on was that COVID was really taking a toll among people who would pass their primes [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4873.24s)]
*  and were in toward the last decade of their lives and weren't no longer in the public eye. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4883.88s)]
*  And so that's that that sort of helps explain the thesis that, yeah, there's a lot of COVID deaths, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4890.84s)]
*  the antithesis that like, you know, it's not like anybody I was like met and I knew at work [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4898.36s)]
*  dropped out of COVID. And then you get the synthesis of like, oh, yeah, it's it mostly [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4903.88s)]
*  killed off people who were who were probably close to retirement, retired [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4912.12s)]
*  in ill health from other things and so on. So I think what's interesting is the point [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4919.88s)]
*  of social science to sense there was a point was to bring the principles of science of the [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4925.0s)]
*  scientific method to bear on the world just right around us and to make it clear what we [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4930.52s)]
*  are actually seeing. I think. Yeah. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4935.0s)]
*  And but it seems like it's used at least over the past several years has been to do the opposite, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4937.72s)]
*  which is to obscure what we're actually seeing, living, experiencing and tell us a story that's [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4943.400000000001s)]
*  not true. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4949.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that my imagination? No, it's I mean, the issue is that so much data has piled up [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4951.4800000000005s)]
*  that you can we can now answer quite a few questions that were beyond our capability [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4958.84s)]
*  beforehand. I mean, and the answers we keep getting are the politic are generally politically [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4966.679999999999s)]
*  incorrect ones that were anticipated by the bad people, the Charles Murray's and James Q. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4974.44s)]
*  Wilson's in the twenty four in the 20th century. So, for example, we have an enormous amount of [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4982.12s)]
*  data from DNA that tells us about our racial ancestry. And what have we discovered in that [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4989.0s)]
*  in this century? Did the the conventional wisdom that race does not biologically exist [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=4997.4s)]
*  be proven? No, of course not. You can you can call up Ancestry.com or 23andMe and they'll tell you [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5005.0s)]
*  your race to three three digits. You know, they'll tell you, you know, if you're if you're Jewish, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5013.16s)]
*  they'll tell you, you know, you're forty nine point eight percent Ashkenazi. Other data is piling up. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5021.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a Harvard economist named Raj Chetty who's done phenomenal work talking government [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5028.6s)]
*  bureaucracies into letting him work with totally confidential data like like the tax returns of [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5036.120000000001s)]
*  everybody in the country. And so he can do studies that nobody ever had the chutzpah to dream before [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5044.280000000001s)]
*  they ever get the hands on the data. So, for example, he gets he tracked 21 million Americans [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5052.92s)]
*  across 30 years of their lives from he looked at how much money their parents made in the 1990s. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5060.84s)]
*  And then he looked at things like were they in jail on census day, January, April 1st, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5068.6s)]
*  2010, when they were about 30 years old. And so then he could plot out what's what are the odds [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5075.88s)]
*  of of a man being in jail based on how poor or rich his parents were. And not surprisingly, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5083.96s)]
*  guys who grew up poor go to jail a lot more. But he could also answer using data from the [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5094.5199999999995s)]
*  Census Bureau what the race was of all 21 million of his people. And he discovered, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5101.08s)]
*  yeah, in general, blacks who had the exact same income as whites growing up as kids in the 90s [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5106.12s)]
*  in 2010 were in jail three to ten times more often than whites who were their exact peers in [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5117.08s)]
*  terms of family income. And this is like, wow, I never expected somebody to be able to come up [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5124.52s)]
*  with that. And it goes, yeah. So when people wonder why are blacks in jail more often, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5131.240000000001s)]
*  is it poverty? And poverty plays a role. But even without poverty, take it all away, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5141.160000000001s)]
*  at the highest level blacks at the highest percentile blacks go to jail about 10 times [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5148.120000000001s)]
*  as often as the richest whites. So we're able to answer all sorts of social science questions these [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5153.64s)]
*  days. But nobody likes the answers they're getting. What does seem like when we finally [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5161.88s)]
*  unraveled the human genome, which was right around the time the bell curve came out ish. Yeah. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5170.52s)]
*  That's when the whole conversation got shut down. Yeah, maybe we had too much information. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5177.64s)]
*  Yeah. What happened at a ceremony that Bill Clinton put on in the presidential rose [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5182.44s)]
*  garden in 2000 for the Human Genome Project, they just sort of made progress [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5192.2s)]
*  decoding a single genome, which was mostly that of entrepreneur Craig Venter, who'd helped out [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5200.5199999999995s)]
*  enormously. And Craig got up and made a speech that was exactly what the zeitgeist wanted to hear. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5207.16s)]
*  He said, we've looked at the human genome or his human genome, and we discovered [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5215.48s)]
*  the one thing you can't see in it is race. There's no difference whatsoever genetically [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5222.84s)]
*  between different genomes in terms of racial ancestry. Well, then within three, four, five years, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5229.240000000001s)]
*  the evidence was piling up. It was like, no, actually you can tell exactly what the ancestry [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5239.400000000001s)]
*  of people is. It became a sizable business very quickly. But as far as I can tell, a huge fraction [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5245.160000000001s)]
*  of the population remembers hearing that the science has proven that race doesn't exist [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5253.0s)]
*  genetically. And they've never rethought it since that 2000 speech by Venter standing next to Bill [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5262.12s)]
*  Clinton. So people want to believe some things. They want to believe that the science has proven [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5271.24s)]
*  all of this anti-racist dogmas that they get told. And they just sort of ignore that, no, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5279.24s)]
*  it's actually moving in the other direction. It's time that we think realistically about [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5287.719999999999s)]
*  what the data is telling us. And personally, I don't think it's the end of the world by any means. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5295.16s)]
*  And I think we can all get along pretty well knowing the realities. But a lot of people [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5303.16s)]
*  are just terrified of them and basically want to lie about it. I mean, the way that previous [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5310.04s)]
*  civilizations held together in the face of knowledge of genetic and racial differences, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5315.639999999999s)]
*  which are obviously real, but they weren't always at war with themselves. And one of the ways they [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5320.92s)]
*  did that was by believing in a religious doctrine that said God created everybody, therefore, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5326.92s)]
*  despite whatever differences we have, we are all of equal value. Without that overlay, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5332.28s)]
*  which we no longer have, how do you keep a society together in the face of these realities? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5337.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Democrats have been moving toward a sort of Nazi type [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5344.04s)]
*  solution of having a scapegoat who unites everybody else by being the locus of evil, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5356.68s)]
*  namely whites. Or the way the Democratic works, it's all sorts of circles within circles. So [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5364.84s)]
*  you get more Pokemon points for being non-white, you get diversity points for being a woman, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5373.8s)]
*  you get more diversity points if you were born a man, etc., etc. But yeah, unifying around a [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5380.6s)]
*  scapegoat population, that does not have a good track record. What happens in the end? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5390.200000000001s)]
*  What happens in the end? We don't know. Does it get worse? Or one of the things we see [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5397.08s)]
*  maybe over the last year is people just objecting to it and pushing back and laughing [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5407.5599999999995s)]
*  at the conventional wisdom and scoffing at it and saying, you know, you guys are just making [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5415.24s)]
*  this up. It's not true. You're just saying it so you can get DEI money and easy, cynical jobs. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5422.44s)]
*  And, you know, we don't believe this. One thing ambitious people are doing, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5430.839999999999s)]
*  and you've written about this, is just denying being white. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5436.28s)]
*  Yeah. And? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5440.36s)]
*  The flight from white. What is that? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5441.639999999999s)]
*  Flight from white has a lot of different dimensions. It's kids applying to college [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5444.2s)]
*  and remembering their grandmother was, their Irish grandmother was born in Buenos Aires [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5454.04s)]
*  before she went back to Ireland. And? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5461.4s)]
*  In Argentina, the whitest country in the world? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5465.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5467.639999999999s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5469.32s)]
*  But it's also happening at the government level, the census and so forth. So the Biden [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5471.08s)]
*  administration just recently announced that they're allowing Middle Easterners and North Africans [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5477.719999999999s)]
*  to have their own racial category, MENA, so that they don't have the [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5487.56s)]
*  unprofitable ignominious fate of having to check white or Caucasian. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5495.16s)]
*  And this has a long tradition in the United States. If you go back to, in the 1970s, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5502.360000000001s)]
*  South Asians were classified as white, but that really annoyed the South Asian businessmen [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5509.88s)]
*  because East Asian businessmen were getting all sorts of low interest loans from the SBA [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5517.88s)]
*  as a minority. They were getting contracting preferences on government deals. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5524.360000000001s)]
*  And the South Asians said, well, hey, we just got off the airplane. We should be getting those deals [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5530.92s)]
*  too. And so the South Asian organizations got themselves declared to be Asian and grouped in [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5535.88s)]
*  with the Orientals and formed the New Asian group so they could get these good deals from [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5545.24s)]
*  the government that white people are not entitled to. And so that was an early example of flight [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5551.32s)]
*  from white. You see it with the Hispanics increasingly. Originally when the Hispanic [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5558.76s)]
*  category was created, it was set up so Hispanics could get good deals from the government and get [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5567.72s)]
*  good affirmative action benefits, but without actually declaring themselves to be racially [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5573.88s)]
*  white because a lot of them were kind of took pride in their kind of they took racist pride in [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5580.280000000001s)]
*  their blue-blooded Spanish heritage and so forth. Well, there's an awful lot of that in Latin America. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5586.36s)]
*  So they increased, so they could set up a separate ethnicity for Hispanics so you could get all the [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5592.5199999999995s)]
*  affirmative action benefits without actually admitting your shame of being white. But enough [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5600.92s)]
*  time has gone by that only your Fuentes types anymore are like really publicly white racists [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5607.88s)]
*  from Latin America. And now it's more prestigious to declare yourself racially I'm Hispanic, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5618.84s)]
*  even though nobody's exactly sure what that means. What does it mean? I'm confused too because it [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5628.04s)]
*  would that include Brazil, which is of course a different language. It's not right and a different [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5634.04s)]
*  colonial power and but of course it's a multiracial country, heavily black country as are as is Cuba, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5639.96s)]
*  which is Spanish. I mean it's like I don't understand what does the word mean. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5648.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, is are Brazilians and Portuguese included in Hispanics or are they Lusitanics? [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5653.96s)]
*  And according to a book I read by David Bernstein, categorized I believe it's called, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5662.52s)]
*  law professor, he said that most of the federal government will not give you a break on [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5672.4400000000005s)]
*  federal contracting if you put down your Brazilian, except the Department of Transportation. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5679.64s)]
*  They'll give you racial preferences for bidding on a highway overpass or something like that if [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5687.4800000000005s)]
*  you're Brazilian. They'll include them in the Hispanics. So it's I mean we live in a society [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5693.08s)]
*  that's increasingly mixed in terms of ancestry. So we have more and more people coming out who [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5703.24s)]
*  are a quarter this and a quarter that and there's lots of money on the table. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5708.52s)]
*  And as long as you're not as long as you don't declare yourself white, you've got all sorts of [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5716.4400000000005s)]
*  opportunities to get free. I wonder how long this can go on though before it just blows up the [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5721.400000000001s)]
*  country. I mean is there any chance of getting back to a race blind posture officially by the [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5725.96s)]
*  by the federal government? I mean you can have whatever opinions you want on race. I mean [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5733.8s)]
*  but the government which represents everybody has to treat American citizens equally as citizens. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5737.72s)]
*  Is there any hope for that? I mean the Supreme Court nominally outlawed affirmative action in [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5742.4400000000005s)]
*  colleges like because Harvard was clearly clearly discriminating against Asians. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5749.16s)]
*  On the other hand, they left huge loopholes like oh well yeah you can write about your race [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5756.52s)]
*  in your essay and you know the missions department can then go oh this kid is [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5763.72s)]
*  you know black so we'll give him you know 50 extra Pokemon points on his application. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5770.68s)]
*  I mean the one issue is that the Asian students are pulling away so fast from everybody else in [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5778.12s)]
*  terms of things like SAT scores that the Asian black gaps are opening up so widely [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5787.16s)]
*  that if you go to total colorblind college admissions at the high end you end up with [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5798.28s)]
*  a campus with very very few blacks qualifying to get in and a huge number of Asians and places [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5806.28s)]
*  like Harvard really worry about whether they might turn out like Yogi Berra's former favorite [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5814.04s)]
*  restaurant that got so popular that nobody goes there anymore. So if if Harvard becomes 56 percent [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5821.08s)]
*  Asian are Asians going to consider Harvard cool or do Asians want to go to places that there's a [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5829.08s)]
*  lot of white people there? You know nobody really knows and you know what I don't know is whether [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5835.72s)]
*  the the Asian rise the rise in Asian SAT scores is completely legitimate and they just really have [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5846.04s)]
*  been getting so much smarter than everybody else in the 21st century the Asian test scores are [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5855.4800000000005s)]
*  pulling away from the field like Secretariat in the 1973 Belmont or you know. Could there be other [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5861.0s)]
*  reasons? Yeah could could it be I mean we know there's a lot of cheating in Asia itself on the [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5869.8s)]
*  SAT. I don't think people bring their bad habits when they come here do you? Yeah I mean I mean [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5875.88s)]
*  nobody can possibly communicate across the Pacific Ocean it's thousands of miles wide how could anybody's [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5883.72s)]
*  text message what was on the test? Or you know just the the enormous amount of tiger mother [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5890.52s)]
*  prep that Asians brought with them from their 2000 year old tradition of taking tests to become [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5898.4400000000005s)]
*  mandarins and and doing enormous amounts of test prep for years. Or is it is it or there's possible [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5907.4800000000005s)]
*  technical reasons that the the people making the SAT have been criticized for one thing or another [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5918.44s)]
*  for discriminating against blacks and latinos so they keep doing things like let's get rid of [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5924.599999999999s)]
*  analogies and that'll be fairer but it winds up just benefiting the Asians most of all. Why? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5928.679999999999s)]
*  Oh it was more of a the when they had analogies it was it was harder to memorize apparently [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5936.679999999999s)]
*  and test prep didn't work as well it took a certain amount of creativity and kind of [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5945.08s)]
*  insight in the brain and but the University of California demanded getting rid of analogies [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5952.04s)]
*  about 20 years ago so the college board said yeah sure you're our biggest customer we'll do what you [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5960.919999999999s)]
*  want and and things just sort of got worse after that. But there has been a noticeable rise [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5965.879999999999s)]
*  relative rise in Asian SATs. Yes huge huge since the year 2000 and I think basically we should have [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5973.96s)]
*  you know blue ribbon commission to look into like what's going on exactly with the SAT. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5984.36s)]
*  You know I mean that's that's one reason that the COVID came. I'm sorry just before you say that but [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5991.88s)]
*  does it still matter? I mean is that the trend of schools getting rid of the SAT requirement is [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=5999.4s)]
*  that real or? Yeah definitely it all happened that during COVID and the racial reckoning at [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6004.2s)]
*  once all the colleges went well they had to they had to cancel some some SAT tests because they [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6011.0s)]
*  had to be six feet apart and they couldn't fit in the classroom etc. And then then they all decided [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6018.599999999999s)]
*  to do to the racial reckoning that they weren't going to take SATs and in fact they're going to [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6024.44s)]
*  make it go totally test optional and the University of California went further they banned the [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6029.96s)]
*  applicants from submitting any kind of test score. And then what happened was that the colleges [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6037.16s)]
*  started noticing like wow these kids who are showing up that we let in they're not very bright. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6045.0s)]
*  They are not going to become computer science graduates of MIT. So MIT was the first one that [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6051.8s)]
*  went ah this was stupid we're going back to demanding standardized tests and now Harvard's [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6058.599999999999s)]
*  jumped on board everybody except the University of California at the elite level is moving in that [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6066.2s)]
*  direction because it was. So it is it is a measure of aptitude actually. Yeah and it yeah it's it's a [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6071.48s)]
*  very good measure of aptitude it tells you know GPA high school GPA is a great measure but it's [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6078.84s)]
*  hard to compare schools some schools are hard in grades some are easy. Having this having a test [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6085.56s)]
*  and having high school grades you can put them together and they work pretty well. But because [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6095.0s)]
*  because of the racial gaps that have been around forever and these things it was decided during [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6101.400000000001s)]
*  the racial reckoning that that absolutely proves as Ibram X. Kendi has demonstrated by scientific [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6107.64s)]
*  logic that the only reason some races might be doing better than other races is because of [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6115.72s)]
*  the evil of whiteness. But of course what it turns out is the Asians are doing much much better. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6125.0s)]
*  Because of the evil of whiteness? Because nobody really knows because nobody's that interested in [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6131.72s)]
*  studying it because it sounds like the kind of thing you could get cancelled for finding out and [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6138.6s)]
*  just in general we have a lot of problems that have been swept under the rug in in recent years [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6144.84s)]
*  because they don't fit within the ideologies the woke ideologies and just to think about them is [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6151.24s)]
*  kind of dangerous sounding. When the planes start crashing yeah will people start thinking about them? [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6160.84s)]
*  I hope so I mean my father worked for Lockheed from the late 30s to the 1980s and when one of [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6167.0s)]
*  his planes crashed he'd spend two months on the site because when a plane hits the ground it [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6174.4400000000005s)]
*  spreads out over a mile or so picking up all the pieces of the plane so they could reassemble it [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6182.6s)]
*  and there's a jigsaw puzzle and figure out why it crashed and also picking up pieces of the pilots [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6189.72s)]
*  and the passengers and so forth. And over you know the last hundred years people who were picked [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6195.56s)]
*  because they were smart and hard working have done a whole lot of good at getting airplanes [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6205.0s)]
*  so they don't crash very much anymore. Now Boeing may be working on reversing a lot of that history [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6211.72s)]
*  but yeah you know we got a lot better at things by having systems to find people who were competent [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6219.96s)]
*  and work hard and now the zeitgeist in the 21st century has been moving away from that. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6231.08s)]
*  Will we see a lot of planes crashing? God I hope not but you know we need to [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6239.72s)]
*  we need to make 180 degree u-turn in terms of what we value whether it's competence or [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6246.84s)]
*  diversity and you know lately diversity has been winning and that's going to get people killed. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6253.400000000001s)]
*  Is there a point I mean I'm asking these questions because South Africa you know tried this [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6259.96s)]
*  and the country is just continuously degraded for well 30 years this year at to the point where [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6264.28s)]
*  there's no electricity in parts at times and the murder rate is among the highest in the world, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6270.04s)]
*  rape rate is the highest in the world and but there's no deceleration that I can tell from [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6275.24s)]
*  afar thousands of miles away but I'm watching and it's like no there's no second guessing it's just [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6280.76s)]
*  like going to ride it right back to the stone age pretend it was never an advanced society. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6284.92s)]
*  In our country which is different from South Africa in a lot of ways will there be a point [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6291.08s)]
*  like when the planes do crash and the air traffic controllers are just high or too dumb or distracted [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6296.44s)]
*  don't care to keep the planes from crashing will there be a public demand like no no no let's just [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6302.6s)]
*  hire viability from now on. Well what we've seen is what we saw with what we talked about earlier [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6308.04s)]
*  homicides and car crashes huge increases and we've seen some pushback against that [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6319.8s)]
*  but you know the establishment doesn't really want to talk about why that happened because [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6328.84s)]
*  it's embarrassing for them. On the other hand the airplanes you know important people fly [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6337.0s)]
*  a lot more than unimportant people do and that's one reason we have like pretty strict rules about [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6344.2s)]
*  who can be a pilot. There was a plane crash in 2009 congressmen take a lot of flights to get back [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6351.4s)]
*  to their home district. The one in Buffalo? Yeah so they immediately passed some laws that made it [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6360.28s)]
*  harder to become a pilot and there hasn't been a fatal plane crash of American airliner [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6368.839999999999s)]
*  since then and you know some of it is we just we got really good pilots these days in part because [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6377.4s)]
*  congressmen worry about stuff like that. Now are we you know but on the other hand the [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6384.599999999999s)]
*  Obama administration came along and basically sabotaged the system for hiring air traffic [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6392.44s)]
*  controllers and congress has set up a pretty good system for finding [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6400.92s)]
*  good people in the 90s but yeah it turned out that it's like white men really like air traffic. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6408.2s)]
*  They really like airplanes it's like you know what is what have white men ever done with airplanes [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6416.12s)]
*  since the Wright brothers? So there were too many whites so the Obama administration came up with a [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6421.56s)]
*  totally absurd corrupt test for to hire more black guys and so what happens is then you get [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6428.44s)]
*  fewer people still make it make it through the training so the training has been kept pretty [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6439.32s)]
*  legitimate so you flunk out more people which then means that you're you're under the number of [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6443.96s)]
*  air traffic controllers you expected so you you're making them work really long hours and they're [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6452.04s)]
*  getting more and more tired on the job and they're making mistakes and stuff like that [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6457.96s)]
*  and it tracks back to the Obama administration's DEI program for for air traffic controllers. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6462.92s)]
*  Can we avoid that? Yeah we we can we just got to talk about it and we just can't just shut down [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6471.16s)]
*  discussion by saying are you saying that you know a stereotype that on average blacks wouldn't make [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6479.16s)]
*  as good air traffic controllers as whites and the answer is yeah yeah I'm saying that so you expect [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6486.76s)]
*  to have a fewer percentage passing the test and we can live with it we we live with it every day [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6491.96s)]
*  in sports that there are racial differences in performance on average and nobody cares that much [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6499.24s)]
*  and you know God bless them we love sports so yeah there are there is hope for the country that we [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6508.04s)]
*  can go back and have a philosophy for you know for things like jet travel that we're we consider [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6514.76s)]
*  it as important as the NFL and therefore we can't have you know racial quotas getting in the way [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6523.24s)]
*  that doesn't seem out of outlandish. No it doesn't so last question and I sort of began with this but [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6530.6s)]
*  maybe you've I just want to push a little more why do you think that you're able to have these [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6538.44s)]
*  conversations and when you travel the country talking about your book you're not attacked and [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6545.799999999999s)]
*  you know speaking of good signs do you take that as a good sign that the country's becoming open? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6550.759999999999s)]
*  Well yeah somebody suggested to me it's like well Steve you're in you're in the best possible [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6557.16s)]
*  position it's the fourth year of a Democratic president everybody's sick of Biden but if [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6568.84s)]
*  Trump gets elected then there'll be an enormous effort on the part of the establishment to crack [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6575.88s)]
*  down on you know honest dissident voices that lead to horrible outcomes like Trump getting re-elected [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6583.08s)]
*  and if Biden wins then they'll go oh we've got four more years and we've we really got to change [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6593.4s)]
*  things so we never let Trump win Trump's type people win again so it could be a short-term [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6603.8s)]
*  thaw or it could be that enough people have noticed and have been empowered by changes like [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6613.96s)]
*  Elon Musk opening up Twitter so that you know I can have 125,000 followers just you know the [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6624.6s)]
*  the accumulation of little changes like that that you know these ideas that I've been propounding [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6634.76s)]
*  for 30 years and have people out there going yeah that's Saylor's ideas they make sense he's like [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6641.8s)]
*  the most reasonable guy in America maybe you know we've gone through a watershed and we're [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6648.04s)]
*  beyond the mania of the racial reckoning and the great awakening [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6656.5199999999995s)]
*  knock on wood I hope so or this period 10 years from now is described as the dark ages where Steve [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6663.8s)]
*  Saylor was actually in public yeah face uncovered I mean what do you think I mean all right let me [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6670.68s)]
*  ask you why why me in particular that I that I became sort of the Lord Voldemort whose name [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6680.84s)]
*  cannot be cannot be mentioned when I'm just you know this kind of to my mind is very kind of public [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6690.280000000001s)]
*  spirited benevolent guy who can see both sides of various problems well I've always thought that [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6700.28s)]
*  I've always thought that you were particularly threatening because you're so obviously moderate [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6708.599999999999s)]
*  by temperament you're just clearly not a hater you can smell that on people instantly you're very [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6713.639999999999s)]
*  reasonable and you use the language that the left would like to keep for itself like of science [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6720.36s)]
*  of reason of data and and you actually argue from that basis and they'd like a monopoly on that [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6729.16s)]
*  and so there's something really threatening about a guy who's like no actually no hear the numbers [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6737.16s)]
*  and doesn't raise his voice that's way more threatening than some guy who's jumping up and [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6741.88s)]
*  down on cable news or you know sending crazed tweets all day long that person is you know [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6748.52s)]
*  his potential audience is much smaller than yours your potential audience is like you know sort of [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6754.120000000001s)]
*  any open-minded person would like to solve a problem that's always been my thought yeah yeah [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6758.52s)]
*  but yeah it's it's it's been you know a long strange trip but did it bother you when they [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6766.92s)]
*  called you a nazi or white supremacist or when they threw these slurs at you for so long yeah [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6776.2s)]
*  i mean i didn't it seemed ridiculous uh but i it also didn't seem like [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6782.2s)]
*  i it also seemed like what they want to do is get you into a position where it's like oh i'm not one [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6791.639999999999s)]

*  so i mean it i i guess it could kind of go either way it depends on who's writing the history i'd [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6893.160000000001s)]
*  bet money that um you know pat bucanan is described in 50 years when there's not a [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6898.84s)]

*  my impression is more history is written by historians who got paid by one side or the other [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6918.5199999999995s)]

*  history books were kind of biased in favor of the south um you know what's how we're going to remember [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6wjy53o3r8&t=6944.12s)]
