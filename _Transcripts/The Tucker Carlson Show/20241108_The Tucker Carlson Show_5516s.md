# Vivek Ramaswamy Trump’s Sweeping Victory, & What It Means for the Future of Government Bureaucracy
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM)
*  So what it is now a little over 24 hours after Donald Trump won the majority of the popular vote about half the Latino vote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=0.0s)]
*  Overwhelming majority of the electoral college [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=10.56s)]
*  Just all three branches of government amazing. Yeah both houses of the Congress and the executive branch [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=14.88s)]
*  What how did that happen? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=22.16s)]
*  I think it happened because it was a rejection of what the modern left has put on offer [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=23.7s)]
*  Which in some ways was a great favor to the rise of this country [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  You need something to actually provoke a rebellion like the one that we had that's right [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  I also think that it is a feature of the leader who actually led this entire movement [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=37.78s)]
*  It was very personal to Donald Trump too. Yes, and I think that's one of the things I've [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=42.18s)]
*  appreciated is that I wrote this like the morning after the lecture the afternoon after and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=46.58s)]
*  And it just felt right to me [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=52.42s)]
*  He's not actually the thing that I've learned as I've gotten to know him over the last year much better is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=54.38s)]
*  He's not an ideologue or a policy wonk and he doesn't pretend to be one right, but he is a badass actually [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  And I think the nation badass [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=65.66s)]
*  The [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=81.7s)]
*  Nation needs a badass as its commander-in-chief right now and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=87.9s)]
*  Democracy kind of works actually in the end like the people really knew [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=93.26s)]
*  What they needed and they showed up in droves to put the right person in office [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=97.7s)]
*  And so I just think it is kind of one of these rare inspiring moments in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=102.62s)]
*  History where the people knew what they wanted they would not be shaken from their will [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=107.42s)]
*  He would not be shaken from his will and I loved being in Mar-a-Lago that night where it was just kind of interesting where everybody [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=112.10000000000001s)]
*  Else is you know myself to included is just like really joyous about what's happening [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=118.34s)]
*  And I'm sitting next to Donald Trump and he's sitting there and he's just yep [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  This is exactly how it was supposed to be wait till it comes in. All right now [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=126.5s)]
*  We're going to the convention center and this is where I was destined to be and what I was put here to do [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=130.58s)]
*  And I think the people of this country right now want somebody who has that level of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=134.94s)]
*  Self-confidence and conviction to bring that back for the country [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  And so I just think it was a kind of a beautiful moment of democracy working and it goes beyond policy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=143.46s)]
*  It's just like the persona of the country is actually what we recovered. Yeah, I mean I've spent eight years watching [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=149.1s)]
*  Republicans kiss Donald Trump's ass in public. Yeah, I'm always feel a little nauseous [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=155.26s)]
*  I like I love Trump just personally because I know him well [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=159.06s)]
*  But I hate hearing people say it's all fake it is it's like now I just [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  got shot I [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=168.64s)]
*  Just I realized I not only do I really like Trump and find him amusing and all I really respect Trump [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=170.76s)]
*  And I mean that when I'm saying it I'm not I have no reason to kiss his ass [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean that and I I felt that I think actually for me [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  That's been a bit of a journey as well is like I didn't know him as well as you know him anyway [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=185.5s)]
*  But at this point in time, yeah, he's the right guy to leave the country exactly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=190.12s)]
*  He's actually the right guy to go through phases of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=194.12s)]
*  Taking maybe I'm being too honest, but you know taking Trump seriously Trump is eccentric. I mean, that's just a fact [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=197.08s)]
*  And you know, he got elected in 16 [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=202.4s)]
*  Not accidentally there are reasons he got elected, but he said to himself many times and it's true [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=207.28s)]
*  I was there he did not expect to win. Mm-hmm [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  And it was kind of this, you know on the road with the Grateful Dead kind of thing, you know [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=214.36s)]
*  Shambolic, you know what I mean? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=219.32s)]
*  This did not feel that way at all. It felt purposeful. It felt like he was [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=221.56s)]
*  Living out his destiny and the nation's destiny. It felt very heavy [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=226.4s)]
*  That's how about that night. It's like it's like a conviction that this is my destiny [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=231.04s)]
*  Yes, this is the nation's destiny and America has this great tradition by the way, we believe in our own manifest destiny [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=234.76s)]
*  Yes, just like we had no reason to believe it. We have no, you know, basically we have no logic behind it [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=239.56s)]
*  We know that we're born to be the greatest nation that sets an example for everybody else of what's possible for human capacity [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  Yes [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  This is the country that does it and we had no reason to believe that other than the fact that we do and I think that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=250.92s)]
*  That's the kind of leader we need right now to bring that back and that's Donald Trump as a person [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=255.04s)]
*  So in some ways Trump's story is America's story [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump's comeback is now hopefully America's comeback and I actually actually just think it's gonna play out that way in the next couple [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=260.64s)]
*  Of years the national spirits gonna be back [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=266.64s)]
*  You'll see it in the composition of the electorate by the way a lot of young people that was probably the biggest [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=268.88s)]
*  Demographic shift just came in a tidal wave of force, which I was particularly passionate about seeing this time around [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=273.92s)]
*  I totally agree and and you know, I think it's just this moment where we're going through a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  great kind of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=286.0s)]
*  Spiritual I don't mean spiritual the religious sense here. I mean the civic sense a bit a spiritual [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=288.0s)]
*  Revival of American identity and like that was that was the pinnacle of what we saw on Tuesday night [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  It there was a moment I think right around the time he was shot and Elon endorsed him within moments [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=298.16s)]
*  Yes, I think is it was looking back, you know a pivot point the whole thing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=303.8s)]
*  But where I think or I myself felt this way like why are we on the defensive people who vote for Donald Trump? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=308.68s)]
*  Why are we embarrassed? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=315.92s)]
*  There was this very successful effort to make people feel ashamed for supporting Trump and it worked for I mean eight years anyway [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=316.92s)]
*  And then in one moment it just evaporated and you saw like [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=323.62s)]
*  22 year old sorority girls. That's right, you know with Trump hats and you're like, wait a second [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=328.5s)]
*  No one's embarrassed about supporting Trump anymore. They're wearing a Trump out in Midtown Manhattan. Totally who would do that? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=334.18s)]
*  Nobody would have done that. Hey, I think I think it's a beautiful thing for the country [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=339.68s)]
*  I mean, it started a little bit with you saw it in the business elite community [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=343.94s)]
*  I mean Elon was endorsement was obviously huge [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=347.14s)]
*  But I think this has been percolating for a little while I was really probably the thing I was most [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=349.06s)]
*  gratified by after the elections the next morning the number of either calls or messages I got from [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=354.9s)]
*  Real serious business leaders billionaires in different domains or whatever [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=360.46s)]
*  I cut they didn't have to do this [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=364.06s)]
*  But a few of them shared with me look, I think you were an important part of giving me the permission to support Donald Trump [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=365.58s)]
*  Give me the permission to at least stand up against whatever left-wing Orthodox in a way that they couldn't have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  And and I think a lot of other people played important roles in that as well [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=377.06s)]
*  I mean Elon probably the biggest role in giving people that permission [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=379.9s)]
*  No, but you're from exactly that world and like just to be super blunt you're from you have the credentials [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=382.44s)]
*  That mark a member of that class. Yeah, and which matter to some people and numbers of giving them the well [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=388.53999999999996s)]
*  That's our whole session is based on them. Yeah, right and so [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  And JD to some extent is like this David Sacks and Elon above all, but you're definitely in that world and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=397.7s)]
*  You know [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=405.5s)]
*  They made a concerted effort to make certain that people like you would never admit to liking Trump [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=406.3s)]
*  that's right and even it's liking Trump and standing for a rejection of the left-wing Orthodox II the last [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=412.14000000000004s)]
*  You know four or five years that reached a fever pitch and peak [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=419.42s)]
*  So I had to step down from my job [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=422.46000000000004s)]
*  You know [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  I first met after I stepped down from my job as a biotech CEO and you know [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=424.14000000000004s)]
*  I wrote my first book for me that was actually kind of cathartic [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  And then I just wanted to other people to be able to experience that as well to be able to like spread the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=430.66s)]
*  Possibility of what it feels to actually speak your mind in the open. It's like a it's like a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=435.54s)]
*  Liberating experience is a good a deep personal sense a liberating experience and I actually just wanted more people to be able to experience that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=442.14000000000004s)]
*  What's the point of having a billion dollars if you can't even express your opinion in public? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  But now I think that that's mostly it's like actually mostly behind us [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=453.90000000000003s)]
*  Can I just push a little bit on that point though, I mean you and I talked a lot before you ran for president and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=457.9s)]
*  I remember thinking you know [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=465.02s)]
*  Most people imagine that if you make a lot of money you made a lot of money young [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=467.97999999999996s)]
*  That that gives you the freedom to say whatever you want [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=471.14s)]
*  But of course the opposite turns out to be totally the opposite right so the more you have there is no f you money [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=473.5s)]
*  That's right [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  There's only a few poverty the richer you get the more vested you are in the current system the more you have to lose [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=478.85999999999996s)]
*  And so I did think you were very unusual in that you made all this money young and you're like yeah [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=484.18s)]
*  I'm kind of happy to first of all stop making money for a while you didn't seem addicted to it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=490.14000000000004s)]
*  No, they'll get addicted to it now. You know what I mean? She spent it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  There was something great about that, but why did [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=502.62s)]
*  Why were you different from like everyone else you went to Yale Law School with? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=506.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah, all of our classmates. You know yeah, he was just the two of us [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=510.21999999999997s)]
*  I could tell you there's some I won't even I won't even tell you about the email chains where they still have the class email [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=513.42s)]
*  Listen, there's a lot of funny stuff that goes on. They've lost their minds over myself. Oh, yeah, yeah [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=518.5799999999999s)]
*  It's actually it's actually kind of hilarious you guys were in the same class [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=523.18s)]
*  Yeah, we're in the same class me or sure JD were all classmates and my wife was in med school at the same time [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=526.86s)]
*  So we were all we were all friendly. Where was she in med school? Yeah, yeah [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=531.56s)]
*  Yeah, which is really funny you all misused your credentials [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=535.78s)]
*  Exactly the bestowed them um so I have to ask you to pause so you're on the Yale Law School [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=540.1s)]
*  Which for those who don't follow the most prestigious law school in the United States [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=545.64s)]
*  I think it's fair to say but also probably the most insane in some ways. Yeah. Yeah, I think all of the six are fair [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=550.24s)]
*  Yeah, so what's the what's the email chain line? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=554.54s)]
*  so each class just has their own has their own like kind of like listserv where they where they all stay in touch and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=557.1s)]
*  After the Springfield stuff right so people were going people were going totally nuts and I'm eating eating the cats [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=563.66s)]
*  Yeah, you know eating the pets right so they were going totally nuts, and then there was this like long thread of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=569.82s)]
*  What charity people were gonna give to in Springfield town? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=576.38s)]
*  They otherwise would never visit never have heard of never have given second care to to say okay [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=579.86s)]
*  Here's what we're actually gonna do to help this community and they started to have everyone piling in well [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=584.0s)]
*  I'm gonna make my donation, and I'm gonna make my donation here and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=588.38s)]
*  It was it was so nauseating [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=591.86s)]
*  But it was actually a very keen effort to get the New York Times to report on it [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=593.9000000000001s)]
*  So the New York Times did report on that of course the New York Times has their own agenda [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=597.1s)]
*  In wanting to report is because it's designed to make money [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=599.7s)]
*  No, just up to two particular causes in Springfield to virtue signal the fact that we're not on the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=602.6600000000001s)]
*  JD Vance Donald Trump side of this and as Yale Law School as fellow Yale Law School alums who came from that same class [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=609.74s)]
*  We're gonna actually make a concerted donation to send a different signal that we're on the side [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=616.6600000000001s)]
*  But you and JD are actually from Ohio. Yeah, actually yeah, yeah actually actually spent a lot of my youth in Springfield [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=621.44s)]
*  I actually know I actually know a lot about this. I'm tempted to pull up the email that I that I sent [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  So I sent an email to the group [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=631.42s)]
*  I never haven't commented on this list is serve in like five years like I've known or ten years probably I haven't posted a [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  Single thing, but I kind of entertain myself watching this stuff from time to time [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  So I actually also went to Springfield myself actually this so this is a well three one back [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=642.04s)]
*  So when all this was playing out I said I kind of go to Springfield and check this out [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=647.3399999999999s)]
*  I have a lot of family that's lived there in the past. I have some family there who lives there now [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=650.04s)]
*  I spent a lot of my youth there [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=653.96s)]
*  There's this place there's a there's a sub place that I used to go to like, you know [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=655.72s)]
*  What I used to play tennis at Wittenberg every summer which is the University in Springfield [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  So I've spent a lot of time there growing up [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=663.64s)]
*  So I said I live like 50 minutes from there right now in Columbus. I grew up in Cincinnati [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=666.2800000000001s)]
*  I live in Columbus Springfield's literally on the way right in between like let me just go check it out [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=669.72s)]
*  So I just was having dinner with my wife and a couple of friends in Columbus and I just put out a tweet [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=675.12s)]
*  I said I'm going to Springfield want to see what's happening see it for myself [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=679.0400000000001s)]
*  and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=683.12s)]
*  No plan for like an event or anything like that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=684.32s)]
*  But some guy then replies and says I have an event space it can hold 375 people we show up in Springfield [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=686.28s)]
*  This is what like a month or month or two ago when all this played out and you know [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=691.16s)]
*  It's 375 people it could hold 2,000 people show up [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=695.12s)]
*  But they couldn't hold 2,000 so the rest were lined up outside and people just wanted to be heard [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=698.0s)]
*  Did I see evidence of cats and dogs being eaten? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=702.24s)]
*  I didn't see evidence of that [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  What I did see evidence of was a woman being chased out of a store with a machete [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=705.5600000000001s)]
*  Her dog by an illegal immigrant who was in this country which didn't get reported on by the news at all [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=708.88s)]
*  But was a function of a woman who actually came and told that story of her daughter [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=713.12s)]
*  Who was literally being chased with a machete out of a grocery store? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=716.04s)]
*  Called the police and the police didn't show up for hours and they didn't follow up with an investigation either [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=719.6s)]
*  So that people deserve to hear the police did nothing. That's what she said and I have every reason to believe her and so [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=724.2s)]
*  Anyway against that backdrop. I also wanted to do something positive for the community having having shown up in Springfield [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  There's obviously a strain on local resources [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=735.44s)]
*  So I wanted to make a donation and as you said I've lived the American dream [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=737.44s)]
*  I wanted to make a hundred thousand dollar donation, right? And so to help that for my family [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  That's an easy thing. We were able to do to help a local community. Where's the strain? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=745.76s)]
*  so we find where the local strain points are access to local primary care and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=749.8399999999999s)]
*  We tried to make a donation in conjunction with my trip, but the organization [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=754.78s)]
*  Did not want to accept the donation that our family was about to give so they've talked about Springfield [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=759.64s)]
*  We need help [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=764.48s)]
*  We need all the people who can to help support the community and yet here is somebody who is living in Ohio has lived the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=765.64s)]
*  American dream [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=772.84s)]
*  I want to actually use a small portion of what this country's given us to help a community [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=773.36s)]
*  That's important to me in the area of health care where there were a lot of strained resources in part because of the large numbers [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=778.72s)]
*  of people who are you know who who've been you know moved to that community and [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=784.8s)]
*  I didn't even have the ability to help the community that way. Why? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=790.2s)]
*  They didn't they didn't provide a great explanation. They turned down a hundred grand donation. Yeah. Yeah, well what who would do that? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=794.6s)]
*  I mean an administrator I suppose but because of your politics I can only I can only I can only assume [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=800.92s)]
*  right I can I I I would say I heavily doubt that if I were [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=808.64s)]
*  You know Sherrod Brown or something like that that they would have turned down a similar donation in a time of need [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=813.92s)]
*  So anyway, I talked about all this when I visited Springfield but afterwards I just I told people that I was gonna help [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=820.6800000000001s)]
*  Support Springfield so I decided to I wanted to follow through on that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=826.32s)]
*  So we found a couple of other charitable causes to donate to you know [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=829.6400000000001s)]
*  In totaling hundred thousand dollars to help Springfield and one of them was a crisis pregnancy center [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=833.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm pro-life and we wanted to at least to help people get to you know strains on the system [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=837.8000000000001s)]
*  It's a different area of health care where we thought there were strains on the system [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=844.0s)]
*  I actually surveyed a lot of people in Ohio and in Springfield privately who I knew where could I have an impact and they gave [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=847.0799999999999s)]
*  Us they gave us this as a resource. So anyway to bring this back to the original story we have [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=852.04s)]
*  This law school listserv where they've made a donation to I think it was like [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=857.88s)]
*  It was a left-leaning group that had a lot of a lot of woke stuff on their front page [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=863.04s)]
*  I can't tell you which exactly one it was [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=867.8s)]
*  Dei all plastered all over wherever it needs to be and they made the donation [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=869.92s)]
*  They got a bunch of people to sign on it every time somebody donated [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=873.5799999999999s)]
*  They would they would reply all and say I have also donated and there was a certain [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=877.02s)]
*  Pride and sanctimonial that they got the New York Times to report on it. They got MSNBC to pick it up [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=880.86s)]
*  So there's a lot of media around that's crazy comparatively not quite as much money being raised even but that's that's that's beside the point [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=885.74s)]
*  And so I'm on this list having to sort of see my you know inbox [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=892.74s)]
*  Repeatedly flooded with every other time somebody made a donation [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=898.3s)]
*  So I just sent a note because maybe there's people who have a different point of view from supporting [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=900.7s)]
*  Exactly the cause they put up so I included a link saying, you know [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=905.5s)]
*  If there's one to support Springfield here are some other alternative causes that you might wish to support my family and I were [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=909.04s)]
*  pleased to support the community [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=914.58s)]
*  They lost it with respect to a crisis pregnancy center. They didn't actually they didn't they didn't like it very much [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=917.02s)]
*  They say, you know, I think they they [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=922.0600000000001s)]
*  they called it a [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=924.94s)]
*  They saw it as they saw it as a insult actually they felt personally insulted that I was going to [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=927.82s)]
*  exploit their [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=934.82s)]
*  Good feeling about Springfield and the attention they wanted to draw by supporting it by offering a very different kind of cost [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=937.58s)]
*  But a beautiful thing happened because this goes to the same trend you and I are talking about [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=942.94s)]
*  There were actually a lot of my classmates who I know lean left of center who then came out and were just like well [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=946.38s)]
*  Have you ever considered the fact that we might also have? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=950.86s)]
*  Classmates who have a different point of view on these questions and you may not just want to be donating to one particular [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=953.22s)]
*  Side of this cause and there was just a debate amongst them [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=958.4200000000001s)]
*  So I didn't I didn't really get further involved in this. I rarely post on that list [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=960.86s)]
*  That was just a two-liner that I had to share to offer an attack you and JD personally on the list [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=964.9s)]
*  You know, I don't read I don't read most of the emails. I think I think there have been a lot of unfriendly things said [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=969.94s)]
*  Yes, so you've got to wonder about that whole world. Yeah, I mean so Trump would depend JD went to Yale [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=976.1800000000001s)]
*  So you still have two guys the Ivy League degrees? Yeah in the top. I don't think that I don't think there's any too [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=983.22s)]
*  Far from being shame in that like I'm very I had a great experience at Harvard and Yale and we learned a lot of stuff [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=989.98s)]
*  I think independently I got a better education [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=994.78s)]
*  Because of a lot of these people leaning left you get questioned more than the I bet that's right [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=997.38s)]
*  Yeah, but there's also over the past several years [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1002.3000000000001s)]
*  There's been a lot of evidence that those schools [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1006.86s)]
*  You know probably aren't good for a lot of the kids they're not the same place as they were kids who go there [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1009.3s)]
*  I mean, you're obviously you've got a strong personality, you know, you think you're not dependent on other people's approval [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1015.26s)]
*  Obviously, you don't seem to care that much [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1020.26s)]
*  But you know most people young people really do care what the herd thinks and for those kids like a lot of them get destroyed [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1023.4599999999999s)]
*  and become completely [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1028.82s)]
*  Irrational and into the you know, the witchcraft of [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1030.4199999999998s)]
*  Transgenderism or whatever they become like not really functioning people and and you just wonder [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1033.8999999999999s)]
*  Like how long does the prestige attached to those? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1039.22s)]
*  Institutions particularly in say China which keeps them afloat [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1042.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's maybe not Yale, but like below Yale. Yeah, how do these schools are dependent on absolutely rich Chinese? Yeah [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1045.0800000000002s)]
*  So like when does that end when do we stop genuflecting before these places either they're going to? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1051.9s)]
*  Massively change what they are and what they represent or they're gonna go the way of the dustbin of history [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1058.5800000000002s)]
*  They are right. They kind of are so the thing is there's a difference between even these places now versus 20 years [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1063.66s)]
*  ago it's just it's just like not the same place in the same institution Harvard Yale always lean left always have had a very [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1069.14s)]
*  You know certainly [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1074.42s)]
*  self [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1076.1000000000001s)]
*  Self-important view of themselves. That's always been the case, but they were they were institutions certainly when I was there [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1078.1000000000001s)]
*  I could tell you from experience where alternative ideas were tolerated. There was a good debate [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1082.6200000000001s)]
*  I actually learned a lot from being pushed by classmates who had different points of view than mine. I evolved in some of my views [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1086.5800000000002s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing. That's what's supposed to happen through a supposedly liberal arts education [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1091.9s)]
*  That is not the institution of Harvard or Yale or countless others like them that exist today [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1096.18s)]
*  There's something dramatic has changed as they have lost their North Star is no longer at least [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1101.48s)]
*  Dated as of let's just say six months to a year ago. Maybe a lot's gonna change [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1108.42s)]
*  We're no longer committed to the pursuit of knowledge and we're committed to the pursuit of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1112.5s)]
*  Affirmative social goals like Harvard's top goal [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1116.5s)]
*  It seems is to drive social change in the world rather than to actually educate their students [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1119.1000000000001s)]
*  Yale has completely abandoned the idea of free speech that the expression of certain ideas is [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1123.86s)]
*  Itself a constant an act of violence in a way that they no longer [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1129.06s)]
*  Would tolerate on their campus? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1132.86s)]
*  I think all of that's gonna have to change because otherwise you're gonna actually produce a bunch of let's just say if feet [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1134.3799999999999s)]
*  Graduates that aren't gonna go on to actually accomplish very much which gives the next generation very little [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1139.5s)]
*  Incentive to want to go through those institutes. That's exactly in the first place. And so, you know what's gonna happen? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1144.66s)]
*  You know either either they're gonna become increasingly irrelevant and go through this process of elegant decay that they're in right now [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1149.74s)]
*  Either they evolve or die. So those are the two choices. I would just like all of us. Yeah, it's true [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1157.7s)]
*  So Christmas is coming and winter is coming and that's the perfect combination for Cozy Earth [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1162.8200000000002s)]
*  Cozy Earth is a company that makes exactly what it sounds like [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1170.94s)]
*  Products that are close to the earth and that are quite cozy and you should consider them this Christmas [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1175.66s)]
*  They have the best sheets available. They're made out of bamboo [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1181.98s)]
*  Believe it or not and it's hard to believe how great they are until you try them [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1186.14s)]
*  We have and they are great or a great fit for everybody in your shopping list. What sets them apart [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1189.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, their fabrics are temperature regulating. That means they keep you cool and cozy or warm and cozy [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1194.9s)]
*  Depending on the temperature and they have a 10-year warranty [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1202.1s)]
*  So if anything goes wrong with your sheets you get free ones go to cozy earth [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1204.8999999999999s)]
*  Comm slash Tucker use our promo code Tucker for up to 40% off [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1211.22s)]
*  If they ask tell you tell them the Tucker Carlson show sent you everyone here uses those sheets and loves them [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1215.3799999999999s)]
*  So what are the effects of Trump's win? Hmm. I think it's a renewal of national self-confidence [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1222.3s)]
*  Actually, I think that we are going to be more [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1228.06s)]
*  Sure of ourselves as Americans. I think we already are [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1232.06s)]
*  I think that the idea that people are you know [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1235.34s)]
*  a lot of people who would have either felt uncomfortable saying this aboard Donald Trump or [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1237.86s)]
*  Didn't even think they did but now realize that they actually [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1242.3799999999999s)]
*  Value what he represents have a greater sense of conviction in themselves have a greater sense of conviction in America [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1245.1799999999998s)]
*  I think that's probably the most important thing. I mean gold dropped a hundred bucks an ounce in like an hour [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1251.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting how that [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1256.5s)]
*  Gold of course the bet against the US dollar [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1258.58s)]
*  So the rest of the stock market and the stock market went exactly in the opposite direction [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1260.58s)]
*  I'm actually and so you know markets reflect confidence and I think the revival of our self-confidence is the most important thing actually [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1263.8s)]
*  Because everything else we could talk about the issues that you know fixing the border restoring law and order [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1270.34s)]
*  Enforcing the law ending rampant crime in the country growing the economy all of those things require a certain level of self-confidence [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1275.86s)]
*  In America requires a certain sense of spine in who we are to be able to say okay an economy grows when people are willing [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1282.78s)]
*  To take risks you're not willing to take risks to create a new business or to grow you know or to invest in a new venture [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1289.14s)]
*  Unless you have actual confidence in yourself and your ability to do that [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1294.7s)]
*  Same thing with respect to the rule of law you have to believe in the validity of American rule of law [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1298.3s)]
*  To actually stand by it even when it's actually hard or unpopular to do so [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1302.98s)]
*  Same thing to say that our own border actually means something you have to have confidence in a nation [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1306.94s)]
*  To believe that that nation is worth protecting if you actually don't believe in what's inside then there's no real reason you have to protect [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1310.54s)]
*  It physically either so I think the revival of our national [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1316.5s)]
*  Self-confidence is the most important thing Donald Trump has delivered and I think is going to deliver for the country [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1320.78s)]
*  And if we get that back the rest of it's actually pretty easy it sort of falls into place more or less automatically I would say [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1326.02s)]
*  But along the way they're all I mean there are all kinds of obstacles and the first [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1334.46s)]
*  Obstacle is finding the right people to staff the government. Yes. Yes, which was it and Trump has said this himself [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1338.1399999999999s)]
*  Including to me like the day before he got elected in public [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1345.06s)]
*  I didn't have anyone to run the government and there were a lot of bad people wound up [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1348.04s)]
*  in positions of real authority [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1352.54s)]
*  Will it be different this time? I think it will actually I think it will because [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1355.34s)]
*  First of all human beings Donald Trump included has learned a lot from that first term [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1360.02s)]
*  I think that if you have somebody who [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1364.6s)]
*  Had never run for office before and I'm particularly sympathetic to this [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1367.4399999999998s)]
*  I ran for president without knowing what the heck I was getting into and it was very much a [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1370.12s)]
*  Firefirst aim later strategy for me over the last year when I ran and so I can [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1375.76s)]
*  Deeply empathize with Donald Trump's first run for president, but not only did he run for the first time [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1381.32s)]
*  He actually won the first time as well and to be able to get in there as you said [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1385.0s)]
*  I wasn't there but it sounds like without even that much of an expectation of winning [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1389.0s)]
*  I think this system was able to strike back [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1392.78s)]
*  Before he and his team were able to get their arms around the system and even still accomplished a lot [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1396.78s)]
*  I mean, I think that first term was you know, I said this when we spoke the other day [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1401.68s)]
*  But it was like the most successful president of the 21st century [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1405.86s)]
*  Which is setting a very low bar because the other presidents in the 21st century have been awful [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1408.6200000000001s)]
*  George Bush Joe Biden Barack Obama are the others and Donald Trump was unambiguously the best of that batch [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1413.42s)]
*  But I think the idea that there's only there's some things you can only learn by doing it [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1418.5s)]
*  I mean even running for president there's only certain things I could have learned about that process by doing it now [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1423.1399999999999s)]
*  Let alone leading the country. I think there's only certain things Donald Trump could have learned by actually being in that position [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1428.3s)]
*  and so this time around I think he is [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1433.1s)]
*  Laser focused on making sure that the people he puts into those positions actually share broadly his vision for the country [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1437.62s)]
*  Broadly share an allegiance people make like this some kind of bad thing but an allegiance to him personally [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1445.54s)]
*  I'm sorry [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1450.26s)]
*  If you're running a company you can't run that company as a CEO if the people who work for you [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1450.9399999999998s)]
*  Actively dislike you or wish to undermine you personally. Well, sure even if they believe in the company's product [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1455.82s)]
*  It doesn't work if they actually like actively hate the CEO [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1460.26s)]
*  So I don't know why the liberal press actually likes to make a big deal out of the fact that Donald Trump wants people who will also [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1462.9399999999998s)]
*  Share a personal allegiance to him and our mission aligned [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1468.8999999999999s)]
*  I think both of those things are required for a functioning organization [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1472.14s)]
*  Terrian cuz under Trump the FBI was always showing up at people's houses and stealing their cell phones and carting them off to oh wait [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1476.46s)]
*  No [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1483.5s)]
*  You know, these people are totalitarians [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1485.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes, actually I know I know a lot of people personally and friends with people who've been the target of FBI raids [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1487.3000000000002s)]
*  including today [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1493.94s)]
*  Alfie Oaks [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1496.38s)]
*  Was a wonderful man he's we would have visited his restaurant and [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1497.86s)]
*  Shop, yeah in South Florida Naples. Yeah, man. I don't know. I don't know anything about the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1502.3s)]
*  United States. I have no idea. He's a very kind human being who was immensely [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1507.4599999999998s)]
*  He just took such great care of our family in the short time we spent with him and wonderful person [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1511.2199999999998s)]
*  I was shocked to see that I would spoke in conservative and I was book in Trump voter [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1515.9799999999998s)]
*  Which is your right to do in this country. Of course. He was a kovat dissident [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1520.06s)]
*  and [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1524.4599999999998s)]
*  He was raided by the FBI today. Now. I just texted him I I [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1525.82s)]
*  Don't know what the charges are the pretext is for raiding his house, but I'm willing to stake my credibility on [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1531.1399999999999s)]
*  Since I know him so well, you know [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1539.58s)]
*  Don't think Alfie Oaks is doing anything that warranted an FBI raid and I doubt he would have been rated to be not been an outspoken [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1541.82s)]
*  Trump voter. So these people are scary. They're gonna be thrown out of power [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1546.98s)]
*  What does Trump do with the mandate that he has [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1553.02s)]
*  Hope as much as possible as quickly as possible [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1556.3799999999999s)]
*  I think that the same I think the lesson from last time around is if you don't move fast the the beast ultimately will [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1558.1799999999998s)]
*  You know will will swallow [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1565.62s)]
*  Any individual hole of course and so I think he's ready to go in with real determination this time around to move quickly move fast [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1567.98s)]
*  I think we need the winds behind our back early on [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1574.72s)]
*  You know one of the things that I think we learned from last time around is a lot of this is just early momentum [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1578.22s)]
*  Right, you've let's say we have three all three branches. Let's say we've got judicial branch [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1582.34s)]
*  We have a great judicial branch right now at the top of the Supreme Court the best we've had [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1587.1s)]
*  Certainly in our lifetime, but you combine that with the strong electoral mandate for the presidency a strong decisive majority in the Senate [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1590.9399999999998s)]
*  Hopefully get a good Senate majority leader picked and then and I think Rick Scott would be great for that [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1597.1s)]
*  But that's it can't be John Cornyn [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1602.34s)]
*  Cornyn is an aggressive liberal and if Donald Trump wins the popular vote in John Cornyn of [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1604.6599999999999s)]
*  Texas who is way more liberal than a lot of Democrats I know winds up Senate majority leader [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1610.46s)]
*  I mean, that's just it's crazy that just assume a few more those correct pieces fall into place [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1614.8999999999999s)]
*  And then even a majority at least an impeachment proof house. I think that we got to go big [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1620.3799999999999s)]
*  We got to go fast two major issues right out the gate one is already the one that Donald Trump's been talking about the entire time [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1625.86s)]
*  You know [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1631.94s)]
*  He's pumped up about it [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1632.26s)]
*  and he is not going to mess around with this is to fix the illegal immigration crisis and actually seal our national borders and [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1633.3s)]
*  he is [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1639.82s)]
*  Laser focused on that. He has made no secrets about that. That's his top campaign message [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1641.22s)]
*  He's gonna keep that promise and I think he's gonna keep it fast starting on day one [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1645.74s)]
*  That's number one and there's a lot to say on that but it's hard to say [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1649.42s)]
*  What hasn't already been said about what needs to be done, right? It's just about getting in there and doing it [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1652.9s)]
*  So that's mass deportation. Number one is millions of illegals out of this country and sealing the border along with it [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1657.26s)]
*  But I'm actually far more [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1663.66s)]
*  Intrigued and interested for the long run in what I think of as the second mass deportation that we require [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1665.54s)]
*  Which is the mass deportation of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the DC bureaucracy? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1671.5s)]
*  And I do think that is what's going to save this country. You can't do that. I think you actually can you can't fire [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1676.94s)]
*  We can all be fired. I've been fired many times [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1683.9s)]
*  I'm sure what you just lost a presidential race like we've all the only group that cannot fail that has actual tenure is not Harvard [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1686.38s)]
*  Professors not even it's not even it's federal bureaucrats. No, Amy Wax just got [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1694.72s)]
*  You know tenure isn't is no protection at all compared to the protection of federal employment [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1700.0800000000002s)]
*  So the one difference is first of all, we have a president who I think has the spine to actually step up and do it [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  But the second thing is we actually have a not to get to you know in the weeds here [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1710.24s)]
*  But we actually have a legal landscape with the current Supreme Court that allows us to do [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1714.48s)]
*  What couldn't have been done in the last half century they have a moral right to work [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1719.3600000000001s)]
*  From home. Yeah, ten hours a week at our expense at a far higher wage than the average American [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1724.72s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. So the funny the funny thing is they have a moral right? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1732.4s)]
*  You can't you can't complain about you actually brought up a really interesting dimension of this if you literally just [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1734.8400000000001s)]
*  Mandated that they have to actually show up to work Monday through Friday [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1739.0s)]
*  I know radical idea they don't they don't go to work actually a good number of them would quit that way right right that step alone [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1742.2800000000002s)]
*  So you don't even have to talk talk about you're in a mass firing mass exodus [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1748.48s)]
*  Just tell them they have to come back five days a week from 8 p.m [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1751.56s)]
*  To 6 p.m [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1754.64s)]
*  Like many Americans most Americans who work hard to earn a living in this country just show up physically to work [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1755.56s)]
*  You'd actually have about a 25% thinning out of federal bureaucracy right there. So that's an easy first step [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1761.44s)]
*  Next step is so the Supreme Court what they've laid out right now is they've basically said in so many words [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1766.44s)]
*  That most federal regulations are unconstitutional close to in so many words [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1773.2s)]
*  That's what they've said if Congress didn't pass it. It's a basic principle here is the people we elect to run the government should run [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1777.32s)]
*  the government [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1782.52s)]
*  That's not the case today. The people who write most of the rules were never elected to their and the Congress makes the laws [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1783.6399999999999s)]
*  That's what the Constitution says, but that's not exactly how it works today and the Supreme Court [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1788.08s)]
*  Thankfully has had a major problem with that. So it was this case West Virginia versus EPA two years ago [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1792.12s)]
*  There was this Loper-Brite case that came down this year that overturned this [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1796.86s)]
*  horrific doctrine called Chevron deference [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1800.8s)]
*  Which said that the the courts have to defer to the agency's judgments on what the law actually says [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1803.2s)]
*  This room course torn all of that to shreds and basically what they've said is if it's a major question if it's something that affects [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1809.24s)]
*  People's lives economically or relates to a major political issue [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1815.6s)]
*  It cannot be written into existence by somebody who was not elected to office or who can't be voted out of office [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1818.36s)]
*  It has to be done by the people who were elected to write the laws [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1824.3999999999999s)]
*  So who could be voted out if they write bad laws? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1828.28s)]
*  That's a beautiful thing and I think that those were seismic [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1830.92s)]
*  That's describing democracy. That's actually the essence of democracy. That's the essence of self-governance [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1834.72s)]
*  So we've had those cases come down under this Biden-Harris tenure [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1841.48s)]
*  But actually if you have somebody who takes over in the presidency now is we're gonna on January 20th [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1846.36s)]
*  Who takes a posture of executive humility and this is the key part, right? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1852.0s)]
*  Because people say oh Donald Trump's gonna go if he's gonna go shut down these agencies, that's executive fiat [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1856.56s)]
*  No, no, no, you got it mixed up the executive fiat's what's been happening for the last [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1861.9199999999998s)]
*  Century really in this country, but over the last four years included [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1866.52s)]
*  Unelected bureaucrats by fiat legislating what otherwise should have gone through we the people and our elected representatives [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1870.6399999999999s)]
*  So the Supreme Court's already said it told the executive bench and you can't do that [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1876.52s)]
*  Actually, a lot of that was illegal and unconstitutional all we need right now is an executive branch that says hey [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1880.08s)]
*  The Supreme Court you've told us a lot of what we're doing is illegal. It violates the Constitution [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1886.08s)]
*  So we're not gonna do that anymore and that requires us to take any regulation any federal regulation that fails these standards [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1891.12s)]
*  That the Supreme Court has given us in West Virginia v.cpa and Loper Brite and there's another case called Jarkus II versus SEC [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1898.12s)]
*  That one that one relates to slightly different issues [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1904.72s)]
*  But the Supreme Court standards all of these regulations that fail that test we're just going to rescind them [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1907.32s)]
*  They're null and void and we don't have to rescind them because we already know they're actually null and void and illegitimate in any way [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1913.0s)]
*  But we will put the public on notice to say these tens of thousands of regulations that have been written by federal bureaucrats [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1918.28s)]
*  They're null and void because they were never written by the people who we elected [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1924.6000000000001s)]
*  Now if you have 50% fewer regulations that creates kind of an industrial logic to say that okay [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1929.28s)]
*  well [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1936.72s)]
*  then we don't need 50% of the people around anymore either and [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1936.88s)]
*  The way these rules have worked in the past is they have this you know this well, right the civil service rules the civil protection rules [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1939.64s)]
*  That say you can't fire these federal bureaucrats. That's been the historical, you know accepted dogma [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1947.0400000000002s)]
*  Actually, if you read the law carefully, it doesn't work quite that way that applies to individual firings, right? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1953.24s)]
*  Say if I fire you you have a special protection to say that I either [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1957.68s)]
*  politically discriminated against you or discriminated for some other reason or if you fire a bunch of people with [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1962.24s)]
*  Discretionary firings if there's a disparate racial impact or a gender impact or whatever you could be sued on a million grounds [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1966.96s)]
*  But if it is part of a mass firing what you call a reduction in force [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1972.76s)]
*  It was just like a mass firing those actually fall outside the civil service rules as they exist [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1977.1200000000001s)]
*  So if you go in that order to say that okay [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1982.64s)]
*  The Supreme Court's already told us that all of these regulations not all of them [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1984.76s)]
*  But an overwhelming majority of them are invalid you go straight down that list and say we have [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1989.44s)]
*  50% 70% 80% fewer regulations [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1994.46s)]
*  Then you look at the 4 million people civil servants or whatever and say that okay if we have [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=1997.82s)]
*  80% fewer regulations, then we need 80% fewer people to enforce them that simply makes sense [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2002.66s)]
*  Then you have the industrial logic for right there under current law [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2008.9s)]
*  Mass downsizing just the scale of the federal government and part of the problem is these things are deeply related [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2012.9s)]
*  When you have a bunch of people who show up to work who should have never had that job in the first place [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2018.98s)]
*  They start finding things to do actually and that's what gave us that regulatory morass in the first place like the Federal Reserve [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2024.94s)]
*  I mean if you just fired [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2032.5s)]
*  You have about 22,000 employees in the Federal Reserve if you fired [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2034.18s)]
*  90% of them there will still be 2000 left [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2037.74s)]
*  Which is arguably on the high side if you have a Federal Reserve whose sole focus is [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2040.3400000000001s)]
*  Restoring the stability of the US dollar which I do think should be the sole mandate and sole purpose of the US Fed [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2045.22s)]
*  Same thing with respect to you go straight down the list [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2050.58s)]
*  What a twenty two thousand employees do with the Fed [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2053.86s)]
*  Oh, they do a lot of calculations [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2056.42s)]
*  They do a lot of conjecture and if it feeds their hubris a little bit [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2057.86s)]
*  So markets and I was you know, I worked at a hedge fund does first job [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2062.9s)]
*  I had for seven years out of college and you know understand the way in which people will huddle around [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2067.1s)]
*  Divining what the exact meaning is of a comma at the end of Federal Reserve minutes [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2072.36s)]
*  Does that mean that they think the economy's overheating so much that they have to raise interest rates? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2077.32s)]
*  That feeds a kind of hubris of the bureaucrat to make them think that there's some kind of genius and some kind of actual [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2082.44s)]
*  Savant that merits this attention [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2088.0s)]
*  But the reason the market actors pay attention to what these Federal Reserve people say is not because they have some sort of expert knowledge [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2090.44s)]
*  That's actually meaningful [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2096.24s)]
*  They're actually looking to see effectively how they're gonna screw it up in the process, right and so [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2097.6s)]
*  Academics took over the Federal Reserve in the late 1990s, but the Fed only has one big lever, right? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2103.4s)]
*  Well, if you do they have a few levers actually they're able to pull yeah [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2108.2s)]
*  I mean just one big lever broadly means how much money you feed in or suck out of the system. Yeah. Yeah [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2112.18s)]
*  That's true, but they've they've used that in ways that have been I think badly destructive [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2118.16s)]
*  Yeah, the country I mean cuz cuz here's here's like an example of how so when the academics took over the Fed [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2122.36s)]
*  In the late 1990s like one of the things that happened and this was a kind of managerial class in this agency [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2127.6s)]
*  That's a three-letter agency in some form the FED, right? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2132.64s)]
*  What they said was okay if wages are going up [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2136.08s)]
*  This is a long story if you want to get into this but we can give you a short version if wages are going up [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2139.92s)]
*  That that is a leading indicator of inflation. So wage growth was a bad thing [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2145.2799999999997s)]
*  So the way you fight wage growth is by tightening monetary policy right to wages going up [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2151.12s)]
*  Here's the problem with that and anybody who's run a business knows this okay [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2156.28s)]
*  Wages are the generally the last thing to go up in the business cycle [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2160.04s)]
*  If things are going really well in the business cycle the last thing most employers want to say, you know [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2163.76s)]
*  I'm not saying it's the right decision or the wrong decision [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2168.46s)]
*  But most employers the last thing they want to have go up is the wages [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2170.0s)]
*  So wages tend to be actually not a leading indicator of the business cycle wage growth tends to be a trailing indicator of the business cycle [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2173.08s)]
*  But you have the academic mindset at the Federal Reserve that said that's one thing we can measure [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2180.6800000000003s)]
*  That we can observe and feel smart about so wage growth we're gonna treat that as a leading indicator of inflation even when it's trailing indicator [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2183.96s)]
*  Well, what does that mean? They tighten monetary policy? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2190.12s)]
*  Precisely into a natural downturn of the business cycle which gives you the boom bust and then what comes after a bust is is of course the bailout [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2193.2400000000002s)]
*  So you get these boom bust bailout cycles. That's exactly what happened [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2200.28s)]
*  You could say in 2000 you could see in 2008 could see some version of it [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2203.76s)]
*  You know even in 2023 although that was a little bit more subtle [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2207.1800000000003s)]
*  And so anyway, that's that's a whole rabbit hole about the Fed [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2210.56s)]
*  But it's an example of when you have 23,000 people show up to work who should have never had the job in the first place [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2213.2799999999997s)]
*  They start finding things to do and when you find things to do that ends up being destructive rather than helpful [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2218.16s)]
*  Which means the root causes you got to get rid of the presence of the people who populate that bureaucracy [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2223.24s)]
*  But in order to do that you need this [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2228.16s)]
*  Industrial logic and that industrial logic in my opinion is what the Supreme Court has already given us [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2230.72s)]
*  Which is this mandate to say the executive branch the fake executive branch? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2235.64s)]
*  The administrative state has written all these rules by fiat. Most of them are illegal like they're actually unlawful. They're illegitimate [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2240.08s)]
*  And so if you have an executive branch says, okay, we're gonna recognize that most of these regulations are illegitimate [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2246.36s)]
*  There's your blueprint for then shaving down the size of the federal bureaucracy [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2252.4s)]
*  Which is then the permanent solution to stop that bureaucracy from perpetuating this kind of illegal rampant action [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2255.36s)]
*  And I think that's the stuff of how you actually save a country boring as that might sound [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2262.88s)]
*  Stop boring and I think [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2266.56s)]
*  I've never heard in all the you know, my whole life in Washington [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2269.08s)]
*  Anybody suggests that this is a process that could really be [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2273.64s)]
*  Stalled or reversed the process being the growth of the federal government [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2277.6s)]
*  Which is just inexorable because the purpose of the institution is to protect protect itself and expand [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2280.88s)]
*  That's like a law of physics. That's it. That's it every institution exists to protect itself for its own benefit [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2286.0s)]
*  That's its purpose and it's demonstrable in its behavior [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2291.16s)]
*  But it's it's so obvious it's so overwhelming. It's the largest institution in human history [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2295.52s)]
*  I've never heard anybody say, you know, we have a shot of like [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2301.36s)]
*  Lopping off 10% 20% 30% 40% like I've never yeah [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2304.76s)]
*  That I mean that would change everything from our foreign policy to our economy to our culture [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2309.84s)]
*  You really think that's that could happen? Yeah, I think it could happen. I think I think it will there'll be trade-offs [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2316.04s)]
*  I had not gonna paint some sort of [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2321.44s)]
*  Exclusively one of the trade-offs you're gonna have a crash in the economy of Arlington, Virginia [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2324.72s)]
*  Yeah, which is well deserved and maybe a boom of the economy elsewhere and long overdue. Yeah, you know what why shouldn't [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2330.36s)]
*  Arlington and McLean and Loudon County share the pain of Gary, Indiana. I don't understand or Springfield, Ohio [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2338.68s)]
*  I don't actually actually gonna take the bright side of this [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2344.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm in the golden age mood right? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2350.48s)]
*  But you can feel the resentment two sides of the same coin though. They go right together [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2354.08s)]
*  Send these people to Gary, Indiana or to Springfield. Yeah, we don't need external [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2358.08s)]
*  External individuals to the nation. You actually fill those open positions [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2363.48s)]
*  We have three million of them sitting in the Greater Washington DC area who you know [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2366.74s)]
*  They could say well, are those people really gonna do those jobs? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2371.7599999999998s)]
*  Maybe they should actually they could be far more productive [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2373.56s)]
*  Than the destruction that they're doing to the country right now [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2375.96s)]
*  We it is a fact that we have more open jobs than we have people in the country [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2378.34s)]
*  That's often one of the backdoor arguments made for mass illegal immigration this country, but actually [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2381.5s)]
*  Okay, you need I think for rule of law reasons you need deportation of people who are in this country illegally [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2387.06s)]
*  but if you get three million people out of the federal bureaucracy in Washington DC, they are Americans and those are [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2392.12s)]
*  Available candidates to actually provide a little shot in the arm to the labor market [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2398.14s)]
*  Why shouldn't the agencies be moved to Baltimore and Gary to the extent they exist? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2401.38s)]
*  I think they should absolutely be moved. Absolutely [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2405.82s)]
*  I don't think all of I think many of those agencies should not exist many of them that do continue to exist [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2407.94s)]
*  Absolutely should be moved to other parts of the country [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2413.1800000000003s)]
*  So I don't think the Surgeon General Office should sit in Washington DC. I don't think I don't think you should have much of HHS more broadly [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2415.28s)]
*  I don't think that the Department of Agriculture should sit in Washington DC. I think there are countless agencies the Department of Education. I think you're [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2421.92s)]
*  Wrongfully insulated in Washington DC now certain of those agencies like the Department of Education should not actually exist [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2429.98s)]
*  So I wouldn't want to start this [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2436.2000000000003s)]
*  Process of just saying okay [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2439.08s)]
*  let's move them out of Washington DC as some sort of polite genteel way of [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2440.62s)]
*  Avoiding and sidestepping the thing that we actually need to do which is bring a jackhammer and a chainsaw to the whole thing [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2445.12s)]
*  But even those that do continue to exist you would actually have a lot more accountability to the people [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2450.64s)]
*  And probably even some some kind of stimulus if you will in parts of the country that wouldn't mind a little bit of that growth [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2456.44s)]
*  Getting out of DC and come into their own backyard [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2463.8s)]
*  These two things go together though because if you actually did take one of those agencies and say hey you have to show up [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2466.8s)]
*  To work five days a week and actually you have to go to Topeka, Kansas or Cincinnati, Ohio instead [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2471.08s)]
*  You'd actually have a good number of the people quit anyway, which avoids the severance costs [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2476.36s)]
*  So I kind of like that method is you could kind of get two in one right there is thinning it down and moving it out [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2481.08s)]
*  But yeah move the agencies out you should fire about 75% of the federal employee headcount if not [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2486.56s)]
*  You know immediately on day one you could go you could ease into that pretty quickly [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2492.06s)]
*  Agencies that are redundant can be reorganized that shouldn't exist Department of Education is a good example shut it down send the money back [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2496.68s)]
*  Workforce training can move to the Department of Labor and loan collections can move to Treasury. There's just a mass opportunity for a mega [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2503.18s)]
*  reorganization and thereby downsizing of this bureaucracy and it's a one-way ratchet because it's not like if another president comes back they can write that [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2511.2599999999998s)]
*  Back into existence by fiat. They'd actually have to go through Congress to do it. And so I think this is a [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2519.22s)]
*  To call it once in a generation [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2526.42s)]
*  Understates it it might be it might be closer to once in a century or once in a nation's lifetime opportunity to [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2529.14s)]
*  drastically [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2536.7s)]
*  reorganize and [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2537.9s)]
*  Reshape and drive structural change in the federal government and I'm pretty pumped up about that. Actually, would you be involved in this effort? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2539.42s)]
*  I'd like to be yeah, absolutely. I've given it a lot of thought it was the centerpiece of my presidential campaign [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2547.26s)]
*  I spent a year and a half of my life. This is it was probably the most I mean [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2551.6s)]
*  I took a lot of positions on a lot of things, but this is probably the single most [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2555.04s)]
*  useful and [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2558.86s)]
*  Certainly personally important to me part of the policy aspect of my campaign last year and [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2560.34s)]
*  Yeah, I have been involved. Let's just say in recent months [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2567.26s)]
*  This is laying out what the blueprint should look like [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2570.26s)]
*  This is the draining the swamp part of the operation that we were promised but never got and [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2572.38s)]
*  Yeah, I knew you've talked to the president-elect about this and many other topics. Do you think he's on board for something this? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2576.42s)]
*  Far-reaching he understands. This is the root cause of the cancer [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2582.78s)]
*  He and I mean he's he said drain the swamp for a reason [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2586.6200000000003s)]
*  You could talk about all the reasons why that was hard to do the first time around [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2589.46s)]
*  One of the reasons is we didn't even have that legal landscape from the current Supreme Court [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2592.58s)]
*  And he made some good Supreme Court appointments that allowed us to have this landscape [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2595.82s)]
*  So now I think he is dialed in understands that [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2599.66s)]
*  Incrementally tinkering around the edges of these agencies. It doesn't work [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2603.98s)]
*  There's a temptation to say if you just fire the person on top that somehow that's gonna fix the problem [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2607.42s)]
*  No, you know get James Comey 2.0 or whatever to fill absurd the same seat [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2611.8599999999997s)]
*  But I think if you're willing to actually [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2616.94s)]
*  Strike the Leviathan at its core [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2620.66s)]
*  I think that that's actually what it's gonna take to save a country and I do think he gets that in a deep way [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2622.66s)]
*  Turns out that what you do online is not private not even close data brokers are tracking and creating a profile of everything you do [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2627.84s)]

*  I mean if they reach the point of like being so totally discredited that they can't continue [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2754.66s)]
*  So here's here's sort of my view when I talk about the bureaucracy as something we need to bring a chainsaw to I actually draw [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2759.4199999999996s)]
*  distinction between [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2766.2999999999997s)]
*  the bureaucracy is its own self-propiturating organism and [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2768.18s)]
*  The individual three million people who populate it [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2771.74s)]
*  So there are certainly some people who are in positions of authority who are just individually bad people [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2774.74s)]
*  Absolutely that need to be purged from the federal government and get out and back into normal life [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2780.2599999999998s)]
*  And maybe they can be rehabilitated, but they're gonna be that's not gonna be the job of the new government [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2786.18s)]
*  That's gonna be something that their own spiritual advisors have to help them through [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2791.52s)]
*  That's that's that's a separate category [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2794.5s)]
*  but I think that's a relatively small minority of the three plus million federal civil servants who I do think are [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2796.46s)]
*  probably [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2804.9s)]
*  Dead weight worse than dead weight because they're actually [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2806.66s)]
*  inadvertently even doing things that are net harmful to the country [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2809.54s)]
*  I think it's the machine itself that I think is a big part of the problem a lot of these people are people who [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2812.44s)]
*  Individually believe that they're carrying out some sort of some sort of good and it comes from this sort of organizational [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2817.9s)]
*  conceit which is [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2823.72s)]
*  Basically skeptical of self-governance, right? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2825.48s)]
*  I mean it's it's as old as it's as old as human beings are is the idea that [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2827.8799999999997s)]
*  You can govern yourself was mostly a radical idea that most people thought was laughable and crazy [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2831.6s)]
*  I mean, that's why we fought the American we fought the American Revolution over the exact topic that you and I are talking about here [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2836.3199999999997s)]
*  Because the basic view is that if you leave it to we the people you'll burn yourself out of existence through [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2841.8399999999997s)]
*  global warming or climate change or you'll [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2847.72s)]
*  You'll harm yourself before you even know it through racial equity [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2850.56s)]
*  Failures or climate change failures [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2855.12s)]
*  That's the equivalent of what the old European worldview was was that the idea that we the people could be trusted to [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2856.88s)]
*  Govern ourselves and express our own opinions. That was crazy. That's why we fought an American Revolution [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2862.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, it turns out that that ugly monsters just rearing its head again saying that no no [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2866.96s)]
*  You actually can't be trusted to self-govern [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2871.02s)]
*  So we'll tell you that you are to give you the satisfaction of believing that you live in a republic [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2872.68s)]
*  That was actually they could think of rewrite the American Revolution [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2877.48s)]
*  through revisionist lens and say [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2881.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, you can't tell people they live in a monarchy [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2883.92s)]
*  But if you can at least keep the parts of a monarchy that are required for society to continue to exist [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2886.48s)]
*  But fool people into thinking they live in a democracy or a self-governing republic [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2891.2400000000002s)]
*  That's almost good enough and that comes with some inconveniences because sometimes it will actually [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2895.6400000000003s)]
*  Even behave a little bit like a democracy at times [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2900.0800000000004s)]
*  But in the core questions at least if it was unelected people who actually made those decisions that machine is [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2902.58s)]
*  Actually what protects humanity from itself? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2909.02s)]
*  And so the people who occupy those positions are individually people who believe that they are doing the right thing [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2911.36s)]
*  Not even for themselves or that they're trying to harm their fellow citizens. They're doing the right thing for their fellow citizens [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2918.14s)]
*  I'm thinking about the average civil servant working at the FTA or the SEC or whatever [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2923.58s)]
*  They believe that if it weren't for them the silent, you know, the Bruce Wayne figure that they are right the [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2928.0s)]
*  hero that Gotham deserves that's how they think about themselves and [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2935.8s)]
*  individually, I guess you could say that that motivation as much as there's a conceit embedded in that like they're not [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2940.2s)]
*  Individually irredeemable people. I just think that they have become part of a machine that is irredeemable. And so I [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2945.8s)]
*  Have the baby they'll continue to watch Jimmy Kimmel that's like a separate issue, right? We have cultural issues in the country [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2953.6000000000004s)]
*  But if we view the bureaucracy as its own target separate apart from the individuals who comprise it [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2959.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that's gonna a allow us to be more successful and be allow us to I think [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2965.6800000000003s)]
*  Sell it to the rest of the country and not in a fake sale [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2972.6400000000003s)]
*  But like a true sale to say that we don't hold this against the individuals who are working here [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2975.4s)]
*  Who have put in 20 years of work to the federal government? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2981.36s)]
*  But we owe it to the rest of the people of this country that the job of the federal government is not to employ these [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2984.6800000000003s)]
*  People so where does the rubber hit the road on that? Here's one where you could call me soft for this [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2989.6400000000003s)]
*  But I actually think this would be advisable. I actually think this would [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2993.76s)]
*  Drastically increase the probability of success of this happening, but I also think that it doesn't really dilute what we're doing [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=2997.48s)]
*  It doesn't have that our purpose. I [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3003.36s)]
*  would actually favor [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3005.8s)]
*  rather generous [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3007.8s)]
*  Severance arrangements with those individuals right like we could debate whether that's a year's a year and a half a year and a half [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3009.58s)]
*  Would be extremely generous [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3015.8199999999997s)]
*  You could say that well, then you're eating into some of your cost savings [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3017.9s)]
*  Not really in the long run. You're still saving a lot of money for sure [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3021.2999999999997s)]
*  But the whole exercise wasn't really about saving their headcount costs [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3023.98s)]
*  Anyway, the biggest cost of employing the people in this machine is the action of the machine itself [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3027.36s)]
*  So if you've debilitated that for a year and a half's worth of severance, well, I mean, what's that? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3032.84s)]
*  It's like a year and a half's worth of not having done this in the first place pay that as downpayment to actually make that happen [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3037.22s)]
*  that by normal employment standards is actually really generous like if you're working at a company and [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3042.18s)]
*  You're not doing a great job and someone fires you or even if you are doing a great job and you're part of a division [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3047.18s)]
*  That's no longer part of that company. You're generally not gonna get a year and a half's worth unless you're the CEO [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3051.5s)]
*  You're not gonna get a year and a half's worth of pay. It just doesn't work that way [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3055.3399999999997s)]
*  You might get two weeks. You might get two months at most [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3058.66s)]
*  So to treat these federal employees [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3061.22s)]
*  Far more generously than they would have been in a private sector circumstance [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3063.74s)]
*  There's probably people watching this who would who would think I'm being soft for saying that no [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3068.18s)]
*  I think we're actually I think that's the right thing to do [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3071.98s)]
*  Because it will allow us to do this in a way that separates this as a personal vendetta against those [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3075.4199999999996s)]
*  I get it who themselves have their families and their kids and whatever does it that we're solving more of a structural problem? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3080.7999999999997s)]
*  And so that's how I kind of separated Tucker is especially economically on the severance piece of this [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3086.3999999999996s)]
*  Like I want to go in I want to go I want to go hard [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3091.56s)]
*  I want to go aggressive, but I want to make this less about going after the individuals [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3093.88s)]
*  You know, they're still free to watch the view if they want [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3099.54s)]
*  You know what they can have a year or a year and a half's worth of their own salary [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3102.52s)]
*  You will oppose it because I mean it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter like it just doesn't matter right now actually. I love that [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3105.6s)]
*  Yeah, and they'll sue and they'll take it to the Supreme Court [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3112.58s)]
*  That's also why this has to be done now not only because it's the window of the electoral mandate we have [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3115.64s)]
*  I think the current Supreme Court is on our side in a way that it never has been [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3120.2s)]
*  Since the advent of the administrative state which is around 1920 like in the last century [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3126.7999999999997s)]
*  We haven't had us we have not had a Supreme Court [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3131.0s)]
*  That has been as aligned with the vision that I'm describing to you as we have now and fast forwarded another 20 years [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3133.16s)]
*  We probably won't really I mean realistically in the next 20 years [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3139.0s)]
*  there's gonna be somebody who you and I don't agree with who's probably gonna be elected president and [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3141.72s)]
*  There's gonna be Supreme Court justices who either die or get swapped out in that time frame [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3145.72s)]
*  So this is a again back to a once in a century century, maybe once in a national history opportunity [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3149.88s)]
*  to really drive [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3155.88s)]
*  Deep structural change in the federal government improvement [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3158.4s)]
*  So here's how I would stop it if I were on the other side and opposed to this. Yeah, I would have a war [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3162.0s)]
*  I mean we have war well sure we have these I mean the federal government is at its current size because of war the main [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3169.1600000000003s)]
*  Physical effect of the Second World War in the United States was was the construction of the world's largest office building the Pentagon [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3176.92s)]
*  We have DHS because of a war [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3182.7200000000003s)]
*  No, it is and it just came into existence of course in the if 9-eleven. Yeah, so [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3184.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, war increases the size of government. It changes attitudes. It changes your society always in terrible ways in my opinion [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3189.6400000000003s)]
*  But certainly it changes it but it creates an environment where people don't question because people are afraid [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3197.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and so they feel like they need government so [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3203.4s)]
*  It's the ultimate big government is is the you know, there's a lot of money spent in the last year [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3207.3199999999997s)]
*  on [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3214.12s)]
*  War with Iran like people want war with Iran. That's that's the word people want donors want I know for a fact [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3215.72s)]
*  So if we get a war with Iran, then we're not cutting we're not cutting the government at all [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3221.2999999999997s)]
*  Interesting, I would give that some thought. I mean you're one of things. It's also true is that [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3226.56s)]
*  Massive Leviathan we're talking about probably I gave that we went to this esoteric example about the Fed [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3231.36s)]
*  But one of the best places and best examples of that is the State Department as you well know, right? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3236.56s)]
*  That is when you think about the swamp and then elected bureaucracy and the people who set policy [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3241.4s)]
*  We're never elected to set that policy [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3245.94s)]
*  I mean the State Department's probably even a far better example than the US Federal Reserve [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3247.56s)]
*  There are too many good examples to choose from but that's State Department is is disgusting [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3251.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably high on the list. Yeah. No, it's got some sort of mandate to make the world gay or something [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3254.76s)]
*  I don't understand what where it came. I mean the point of the State Department is to conduct diplomacy on behalf of the United States [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3260.14s)]
*  It's not to change cultures around the world to fit, you know, the mores of Bethesda, Maryland actually [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3266.18s)]
*  So well, I think it's it's behaved like most organizational bureaucracies [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3271.8599999999997s)]
*  It takes on a life of its own and so that's it [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3275.2999999999997s)]
*  That's it again another example of an agency and it's just another agency really that needs to be you know [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3277.7599999999998s)]
*  We've got to take the same attitude to say that if you got a bunch of people showing up to work who shouldn't ever had [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3283.66s)]
*  They start finding things to do that are generally damaging and that could include even not only in our own soil [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3288.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh my gosh, but abroad as well. Oh, it's I mean my dad [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3293.02s)]
*  The warfare state is upstream of the welfare state in some ways to even relates to the to the immigration crisis actually [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3296.78s)]
*  More so in Europe, though. I think it probably will eventually be directly linked to the immigration crisis here, too. We're part of Europe's mass [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3304.1400000000003s)]
*  invasion if you will of illegals entering Europe is [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3312.86s)]
*  Actually the consequence of US disruptions that we created the war in Syria. Absolutely. Yes Syria and Libya. That's exactly right [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3317.38s)]
*  No, we did that and so that that necessitates a welfare state [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3325.2000000000003s)]
*  We're different from Western European countries [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3328.98s)]
*  But if you view the West more broadly and the rise of the welfare state in the West [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3330.42s)]
*  The warfare state actually creates the need for that welfare state which then actually creates the magnet that keeps the illegal [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3333.62s)]
*  Migration pattern coming and the labor, you know, the real labor shortage in this country is in the Pentagon [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3340.94s)]
*  They can't meet their recruitment goals. Yeah, and so they're gonna start. Yeah waving in illegal aliens and giving them automatic weapons [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3345.38s)]
*  Do you think that's do you think that's? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3352.34s)]
*  Gone. Yeah, and so then you then you have you know late Rome [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3354.9s)]
*  Where the Germanic tribes are populating your history? Yeah. Yeah, it's it's terrifying [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3359.62s)]
*  But okay, so let me ask you about the election. Yeah, it's so dark. I can't even think about it, but that's where we're going [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3364.7000000000003s)]
*  Um [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3370.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay, so within hours of the election of Trump being declared the winner in this last election numbers appeared on the internet [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3371.8199999999997s)]
*  Which are accurate which I know you've seen that showed the vote totals in the last four elections for the Democrats [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3379.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and in three out of the four the number of including this one the number hovered between say 59 and 65 [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3384.98s)]
*  Million votes and then you have this weird anomaly in 2020 where it was 81, huh? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3392.14s)]
*  So, how do you go was such a compelling candidate that doesn't make any sense [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3398.2599999999998s)]
*  So this candidate his vice president she received she Kamala Harris received they tell us [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3404.02s)]
*  Wikipedia tells us received 81 million votes in [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3411.7799999999997s)]
*  2020 and then somehow she received 15 million fewer [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3415.14s)]
*  What happened to those 15 million that just does not make it I just dare anyone to explain that to me [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3420.74s)]
*  I mean look I'm I'm I'm not a scholar on this stuff. Oh, I will tell you [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3425.46s)]
*  What about so I think a good number of those on the super positive side of this a lot of those people are the people [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3432.14s)]
*  Who are given the permission structure? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3438.66s)]
*  Whether those people and I will put that to one side [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3440.14s)]
*  But there are a lot of people who actually did vote for Joe Biden who? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3442.16s)]
*  Could not stomach voting for anyone other than Donald Trump this time around. I think it's great [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3447.06s)]
*  Yeah, but Trump's numbers stayed the same [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3450.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Trump's numbers have stayed the same true for through three elections pretty much the same [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3452.8199999999997s)]
*  And let's just let's just cut to the chase on this we won the election [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3457.7799999999997s)]
*  Here's what we do single-day voting on Election Day as a national holiday with paper ballots and [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3460.9799999999996s)]
*  Government issued ID to match the voter file and I would also add while we're at it make English the sole language that appears in [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3466.18s)]
*  A balance. Yes, and you know what? It's a beautiful thing [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3471.5s)]
*  Puerto Rico does it this way. There's other countries that do it this way [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3474.66s)]
*  I think that that's something that we could actually do the country that [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3476.8999999999996s)]
*  Sent a rocket out and caught it on the way back. Yes, we would be able to actually run [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3480.58s)]
*  Elections on a single day with paper ballots [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3485.54s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3487.54s)]
*  And send dominion packing and the fact the fact that there is resistance to this let's just say the policy proposal on offer [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3487.62s)]
*  Okay, that I've said it countless times now when Trump's talked about this single-day voting on Election Day [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3494.22s)]
*  Make it a national holiday that actually brings people together [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3499.18s)]
*  Paper ballots government issued ID to match the voter file [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3502.06s)]
*  If that is if that is objectionable that itself raises doubts about exactly what the heck is so I don't think Kamala Harris [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3505.46s)]
*  You can check this but I I'm pretty sure Kamala Harris did not win any states with voter ID law [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3512.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, is that right? Yeah, and she didn't lose any interesting. She didn't lose any states that don't require voter ID. Huh? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3518.7799999999997s)]
*  So, um, that's really interesting [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3525.74s)]
*  No, I'm not saying there's a connection there for vague but um, you're following the science [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3528.66s)]
*  So I just don't understand and I again I've been in you know [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3533.1s)]
*  18 hours or whatever of depositions from voting machine companies to disgusting companies [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3537.02s)]
*  I was not named in either suit, but they hauled me in and tried to wreck my life just for I don't know [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3542.1s)]
*  I guess disagreeing with them or something [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3547.52s)]
*  Smartmatic and dominion disgusting companies. Um [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3549.7799999999997s)]
*  Why do we have electronic voting machines no one will say this because they're afraid of getting sued by these companies [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3554.74s)]
*  What's what I haven't followed the the industrial history of this when did that come into when did they start using them and what was the [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3559.7999999999997s)]
*  justification [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3566.62s)]
*  justification was that they're more efficient and faster more accurate and faster and [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3567.88s)]
*  They turned out like it takes a lot longer to get our head. No [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3571.96s)]
*  So India I think is the largest country in the world [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3576.0s)]
*  I think they we reset the population numbers recently and if it's not the largest it's one of the largest by populace second largest [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3579.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think largest now. Yeah, I think it is the largest and I [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3585.2799999999997s)]
*  Large democracy for sure in the history of the world and I think they finished counting in one day every time. Is that correct? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3588.28s)]
*  I think he did is pretty fast. Yeah, just do it pretty fast [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3594.6800000000003s)]
*  As I said even even I mean like you look at a territory the eyes is in Puerto Rico like runs their elections with such [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3597.2000000000003s)]
*  Executional excellence compared to the rest of the United States and they keep the power grid going [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3606.2000000000003s)]
*  They can pull off a fair election. It's unbelievable. And so [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3612.36s)]
*  We what do we say this time around this had to be by such a decisive margin that a [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3616.38s)]
*  Landslide minus some shenanigans is still going to be a decisive victory and that's what we got. So my view is [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3622.2200000000003s)]
*  we can and there's gonna be such a temptation to do this is [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3628.1400000000003s)]
*  We actually won like we're actually in a winning position right now [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3633.42s)]
*  So like I more or less like could care less for the Kamala Harris or Joe Biden pastor [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3638.02s)]
*  Like I just don't it just doesn't matter. That's the spirit [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3642.7799999999997s)]
*  What I care about is like how are we actually going to fix it in a lasting way? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3645.2599999999998s)]
*  Like in a way that just lasts for a really long time [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3648.7799999999997s)]
*  I think there would be enough of an opportunity when you think about the majority were now commanding in the Senate [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3650.7799999999997s)]
*  I think we can do this nationally where you make election day national holiday put on a single day and at least for federal [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3655.7s)]
*  elections because states election state elections run by states, but at least for a federal election all 50 states have a bit of bare minimum standard of [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3661.3199999999997s)]
*  single-day voting paper ballots [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3669.4199999999996s)]
*  Government issued ID to match the voter file period. I think more or less we've solved [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3672.0s)]
*  The problem of public confidence in elections for the long run [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3677.96s)]
*  I think you solve it you solve it right there against that then I'd like to offer [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3680.8s)]
*  I'd like I'd love to hear the best possible argument offered against that. I haven't really heard one. Yeah, black people don't have IDs in this [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3684.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that's a racist supposition [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3690.8s)]
*  So, you know and then they will allege racism for somebody who actually thinks anything different than the actual most racist thought on the matter [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3693.8s)]
*  But I haven't heard a good compel most black people favor voter ID laws actually most people favor voter ID laws [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3700.56s)]
*  so should not be surprising that most black people also favor voter ID laws and [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3706.8s)]
*  You know, I think if somebody's on their way to you know [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3710.64s)]
*  There's some driving somebody's analogy that I thought was pretty good [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3714.68s)]
*  He's driving on their way to vote and they actually get pulled over they say no, I'm on my way to vote [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3717.0s)]
*  That's your way out of actually a speeding ticket because if you're on your way to vote, you don't need a voter ID [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3721.2s)]
*  But if you're driving anywhere else you do it's kind of a funny little paradox [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3724.92s)]
*  So most it's common sense [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3728.2400000000002s)]
*  It's called common sense because most people it's everywhere tend to have it and I think most people agree on this issue [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3730.16s)]
*  We now have enough of a mandate. So I think let's just let's just do it [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3736.52s)]
*  We are proud at TCN to offer quality long-form programming films documentaries short series [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3740.04s)]
*  And we've got a new one rolling it out [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3747.2s)]
*  It's a six-part documentary series called all the president's men the conspiracy against Trump [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3748.76s)]
*  It's made by our friend the documentary filmmaker Shawn Stone all six episodes available now at Tucker Carlson [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3755.04s)]
*  Calm it's an in-depth look at what happened in the first Trump administration [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3761.1200000000003s)]
*  2016 to 2020 and while the rest of us sort of busy watching TV [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3766.0s)]
*  Behind the scenes permanent Washington particularly the intel agencies and the law enforcement agencies under the indirect [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3771.04s)]
*  But pretty clear command of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3777.6400000000003s)]
*  Set out to systematically destroy not just Donald Trump but the people around him people who supported him and this series explains exactly [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3781.44s)]
*  What happened it's worth seeing as Donald Trump starts his second presidency [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3787.98s)]
*  This series has interviews with the people who are targeted and presents it in a way that will help you understand exactly what happened [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3793.0s)]
*  How American democracy as democracy was undermined by the people who claim to be defending it? It's in this series and it's [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3798.88s)]
*  Absolutely worth it all the president's men the conspiracy against Trump out now on Tucker Carlson comm [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3807.48s)]
*  So how did you when I saw you in Florida on election night with Trump and [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3817.08s)]
*  You clearly like him. He clearly likes you [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3823.48s)]
*  You know running against somebody for office is not a natural environment for a friendship to sprout all [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3826.6800000000003s)]
*  You know Jeb Bush was not there. Yeah [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3833.0s)]
*  How did you end up liking Trump how did he end up liking you? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3836.2200000000003s)]
*  Why do you have such an easy friendship after running against him? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3839.42s)]
*  I think we're both unusual individuals in ways that caused us to gel actually. I didn't see the point in [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3842.42s)]
*  running [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3850.1000000000004s)]
*  I run against Trump for sure and you know, I made my case for why I thought I was the right candidate [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3851.3s)]
*  You know, I think that there's I was the youngest person ever to run for us president as a Republican [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3855.7400000000002s)]
*  And I do think that there is an opportunity to lead and bring in a new generation in some ways as we have [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3860.06s)]
*  Nonetheless in the last year, but I didn't do the Trump bashing thing. Like it just seemed [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3865.66s)]
*  Seemed kind of lame. It seemed really facile. He was yeah, but is these things right? Everyone starts out that way [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3871.1s)]
*  But then it gets intense it gets intense. Yeah, and we had our we had our sharp moments over the course of the campaign [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3876.9s)]
*  Sure, but it wasn't how did you was a personal? Well, how did you do that? How'd you not get mad? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3883.3s)]
*  They all get mad at the end. It was interesting [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3887.94s)]
*  I guess the whole thing wasn't an exercise that I took super personally anyway [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3895.1400000000003s)]
*  I think when you take this stuff too personally it becomes exhausting but for me it was look [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3899.0600000000004s)]
*  I feel like I have a calling for the country. I'm running for something. I'm running for my vision and [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3903.2200000000003s)]
*  You know what along the way because it was deeply consistent my vision [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3908.9s)]
*  I respected Donald Trump like in a certain sense if you think about like a family business [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3912.1800000000003s)]
*  Or something right you have you're gonna have a guy who the started it that bequeaths it to his kids [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3916.1s)]
*  At some point along the way there are some bumps in the road in terms of you know [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3921.46s)]
*  How that happens and when and when's the right time for the torch to be passed on and those would be legitimate [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3925.7799999999997s)]
*  Disagreements arguments within the context of family business [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3934.02s)]
*  I know many people who have been in that similar position [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3936.5s)]
*  And so in that sense of carrying the American torch we can have like a reasonable debate about when the right time is [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3938.5s)]
*  For that to be able to pass on to the next generation of leaders or whatever [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3944.42s)]
*  But I came from a place of actual deep respect for Donald Trump the whole time that I ran [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3948.34s)]
*  Because one of the reasons why is it was a fact of the matter that I was [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3952.9s)]
*  Self-aware about myself. I would not have thought about running for US president had Donald Trump not actually done it [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3956.5s)]
*  As a first-time outsider and won in 2016. Yeah, of course. Like I don't think that that [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3962.02s)]
*  I don't think that idea would have occurred to me [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3967.06s)]
*  I'm a [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3971.06s)]
*  I'm a [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3973.14s)]
*  You know, i'm an entrepreneur. I believe in achieving things that have been achieved before but that particular thing [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3974.34s)]
*  I just wouldn't have even considered that possibility had Donald Trump not run won and been a successful president [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3979.22s)]
*  And so, you know, I said on the debate stage at that [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3986.02s)]
*  Donald Trump was the greatest president of the 21st century and I think it actually caused [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3988.2599999999998s)]
*  More anger from the other candidates on that stage at me for the rest of the race [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3991.7799999999997s)]
*  Than Donald Trump or I ever had with respect. Oh really they didn't like that. They didn't like that very much who didn't like it [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=3996.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I think most of the other people on the debate stage with me actually how many were there? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4001.22s)]
*  This started with like 10. Um, you know, I the last debate I had it was if there was four of us up there [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4006.2599999999998s)]
*  um [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4012.5s)]
*  That was interesting. Oh there was there's [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4013.4599999999996s)]
*  Oh so many things I would do differently, but that's that's a story for another day, you know [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4016.2599999999998s)]
*  I think the hardest the hardest part was in the short windows into a campaign [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4024.1s)]
*  That you that you have interfacing with like 300 million people [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4030.1s)]
*  I think even the people who were in physical rooms with me understood me at a different and deeper level [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4034.74s)]
*  Than the 99.9 percent of the electorate than ever was but who saw [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4040.18s)]
*  Saw the few windows that they had to see who you are now the debates one of the things I learned about them is that [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4046.98s)]
*  This is different for a general election debate if you're going against like trump versus harris or trump versus biden people watch that and for good [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4053.7s)]
*  Reason i'm glad they did but like in a republican primary debate in the early cycle where there's like 10 people standing on a stage [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4058.82s)]
*  Most people don't actually watch that debate or see what happened for themselves [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4066.1800000000003s)]
*  But what they do see is the distillation of it and so the clips as we say the clips [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4070.42s)]
*  But even even the even just like the verbal descriptions of actually what happened. That's what they get is the synthesis [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4075.3s)]
*  So the audience functionally of a primary debate [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4081.3s)]
*  Isn't really the electorate it's two groups of people [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4084.26s)]
*  It's the gatekeepers in the media and it is the people who fund campaigns like that's the audience that actually matters [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4087.3s)]
*  I mean I mean i'm not saying it should work that way and i'm saying I want it to work that way but [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4093.94s)]
*  Functionally if you're looking at moving the ball forward in a in a race [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4098.4800000000005s)]
*  That is the group that determines whether or not that event actually advanced your campaign forward [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4103.14s)]
*  Towards victory and at a certain point the campaign I mean you and I actually spoke a few times over including over [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4110.179999999999s)]
*  Conversations like this we had while I was running [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4114.74s)]
*  You know the conclusion I arrived at was here's my strategy. I'm going to tell you what I actually believe right now [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4117.0599999999995s)]
*  and [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4124.339999999999s)]
*  99 percent of the time that was the same thing that I believed [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4125.94s)]
*  Four years ago one percent of the time it was not but i'm going to tell you what I believe right now [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4129.0599999999995s)]
*  And i'm going to tell it to you straight without filters [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4133.219999999999s)]
*  And it felt like that should be a winning electoral strategy [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4136.9s)]
*  I'm, not sure it's the winning electoral strategy, but this race was just so different from [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4141.7s)]
*  Any other one because in retrospect there's literally [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4146.9s)]
*  It's foolish for anybody myself included to think that anybody else was going to come out of this process other than donald trump as the nominee [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4150.339999999999s)]
*  And it's because the moment right now that we're in the people of this country know what they need when they need it [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4157.379999999999s)]
*  And they needed a guy who had been there who had who was strong enough [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4162.66s)]
*  Who wasn't necessarily an ideologue but who was a badass who actually had [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4166.34s)]
*  Had the experience and was ready from those learnings to be charged up and go back in and actually take it to the next level [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4170.18s)]
*  So they they knew that and I don't think the outcome was going to be any different of terms of who the nominee was regardless [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4176.1s)]
*  Of what I did but there was still a lot of a lot of learnings through the process now things like I could have done better [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4180.82s)]
*  I'll be a million things I could have done better but [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4188.82s)]
*  I think that [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4191.46s)]
*  You know, I think that [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4195.86s)]
*  Being unsparing as I was I think I that I wouldn't change [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4197.7s)]
*  But to be able to combine that a little bit more with if there's a way for me to allow [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4201.54s)]
*  A lot of people to sort of know me the way that like my employees at my businesses know me [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4206.099999999999s)]
*  Or my closest friends know me I would I would love to think about how to do that donald trump's actually really good at that [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4210.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he is. Yeah [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4215.46s)]
*  And I think that he is he's like the best at it and watching him even in the year since I left the campaign has been [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4216.18s)]
*  Eye-opening it's been kind of inspiring actually and it's made me think a lot about [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4222.820000000001s)]
*  He's able to take you know 20 000 people in a room at a time [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4227.38s)]
*  But also 100 million people not in the room at that time to really get to know [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4230.34s)]
*  Him like who he is and feel like they actually deeply know him as a person as opposed to just his policies [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4236.34s)]
*  I think I was really good at allowing a lot of people around the country to know what my policies were [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4241.62s)]
*  What my specifics of were my vision for america? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4246.58s)]
*  I found it a little bit hard to figure out how to let people on the other side of right now [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4249.459999999999s)]
*  I know who you actually get it. It's it's difficult. That was that was like kind of one of the one of the reflections [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4254.339999999999s)]
*  Trump is more self-deprecating than he gets credit for quite self-deprecating actually. It's actually really funny [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4258.74s)]
*  It's actually really funny the other night in last week of the campaign [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4264.099999999999s)]
*  He was pivoting against the trump voters or garbage biden's comment. He shows up in a garbage truck wearing [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4267.38s)]
*  I think you were there wearing the you know, day glow vest and he comes out on stage wearing it [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4273.14s)]
*  He says by staff told me they wanted me to wear this I want to wear it and they said to me [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4278.820000000001s)]
*  Makes you look thinner. Yeah, I know I like that and I said anything makes you look thinner. I'm four. It's like that's hilarious [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4282.34s)]
*  That's true. It's hard to say stuff like that about yourself. Yeah [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4287.9400000000005s)]
*  So what about i've just wondered like one of the [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4290.9800000000005s)]
*  Sort of ongoing side skirmishes that I tried to pay too much attention to but is a little mesmerizing [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4293.7s)]
*  Is that is the uh, the never trump movement? Oh, yeah, what's going on with that most? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4298.740000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't think nothing anything actually and i'm interested because they're all people I know [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4302.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, um because i'm from washington for you does for you. Yeah, and they're so [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4307.3s)]
*  They're just so repulsive. Yeah to me [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4312.02s)]
*  um [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4315.46s)]
*  But what do you think is going on? I think there's a kind of well, there aren't any of psychological derangement [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4316.42s)]
*  That's sad. It's almost like a it's like a condition that needs to be treated with like 100 [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4320.74s)]
*  By a priest or something totally if you're you know, whatever dick cheney's repulsive little daughter or [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4325.86s)]
*  Jonah goldberg or so, you know, it's like you're not [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4332.34s)]
*  They're just not impressive people they were [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4336.179999999999s)]
*  exercising authority far beyond what [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4338.98s)]
*  They had earned in my view in the first place both are the products of nepotism [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4342.26s)]
*  And they're just mad that their world ended whatever but here's the I don't want to be mean about it though [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4346.42s)]
*  That was me [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4350.5s)]
*  Really mean but true honest. It was true [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4351.7s)]
*  But the in the closing days of the campaign the harris people kept telling us there were a lot of [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4355.86s)]
*  People like that. There were a lot of republican women who weren't going to vote for trump because he's too repulsive [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4361.62s)]
*  They wouldn't tell their husbands. They wouldn't tell their husbands [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4366.5s)]
*  And they're going to vote for comel harris and it turns out like the never trump world has gotten so much attention [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4369.22s)]
*  But there's like no one in it. No clothes. Absolutely. There's no one there. Totally. Yeah [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4376.26s)]
*  It was it actually ended up just being a mirage that whole thing at the end started that actually really got under my skin [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4379.7s)]
*  A little bit like the whole thing about going to the ballot box and vote differently than your husband [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4383.78s)]
*  Like that was a pitch that was made subverting the family subverting the marriage encouraging a spouse to lie [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4388.66s)]
*  Yeah, you could you could vote differently but like the idea that you want to do it secretly creates this some kind of [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4395.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, so it's it's the ultimate division play because identity politics divides us based on it is the division [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4400.099999999999s)]
*  The natural extension of division on race division on gender division on gender within the household because they're [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4405.14s)]
*  Fundamentally against the household as a unit anyway, that's for sure. And so that was that was that was probably the thing to piss me off [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4412.18s)]
*  Well, I don't even understand it. I mean, I I know someone really well was saying that wow, you know [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4417.9400000000005s)]
*  We're voting differently in our household night. I said to my wife if we had dip we're gonna vote for different people first of all [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4422.58s)]
*  I would say absolutely not we're not going for different people. Sorry that we're not gonna vote [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4428.34s)]
*  If we're gonna vote for different people [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4432.66s)]
*  And second we're gonna take the weekend and talk for as long as it takes to get on the same page [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4434.5s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe i'll change my view. Maybe i'll change yours, but we're gonna align because we're married. Yeah, I don't even understand [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4440.02s)]
*  You're on the same team [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4446.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so basically they're encouraging people [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4450.26s)]
*  To not only split the team but to lie about it and actually that to lie to your husband [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4454.42s)]
*  Yeah, boy that is the democratic party just distilled it's the lie to your husband party's the weak man unhappy woman party [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4458.66s)]
*  Sorry, oh it makes me there's something really sinister about that. There's something sinister about it [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4465.22s)]
*  But it reveals I mean that's what it's something sinister about it, but it's also [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4470.42s)]
*  I mean, that's transparently what the agenda is. Of course [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4474.66s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4477.3s)]
*  And so that was in some ways the tactics of the politics of it revealed a big part of what the whole project was [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4477.62s)]
*  They're always telling you during co vid or during the blm riots the real insurrection, uh, which is what that was [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4484.1s)]
*  Um, you know go home and lecture your racist uncle or grandfather at the thanksgiving table. That's right [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4490.74s)]
*  That's right. That was again your family that was again destroy your family over what your what your ideological [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4496.5s)]
*  Obligation is do you think the culture changes? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4503.04s)]
*  I think I think it has to I mean, I think if we get our job right here [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4506.42s)]
*  Let's say we're just going in dismantling nuke and you know, the administrative state [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4510.9s)]
*  Actually fixing illegal immigration in this country and actually having secure national borders reviving our self-confidence. I can't see how the culture [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4515.78s)]
*  Doesn't change and in some ways actually it's a cultural change that might even just be the wrong framing of it [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4523.7s)]
*  That is a small part of the story [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4529.7s)]
*  I think in some ways the culture [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4532.339999999999s)]
*  Has already changed and the best evidence of that is what we saw the last couple of days what we saw on tuesday night [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4534.0199999999995s)]
*  Where by the way at the time you and I scheduled this to sit down [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4540.5s)]
*  I was kind of skeptical because I thought we're going to be like sitting here [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4543.06s)]
*  Looking at like tv screens and like counting ballots in pennsylvania or something like that which would have been a horrific way to spend time [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4545.860000000001s)]
*  But the fact that we're not doing that and that very night [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4551.860000000001s)]
*  We actually knew the result in the way that nobody anticipated [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4555.860000000001s)]
*  Suggests that we actually have already had the cultural change in this country and it was just revealed to be so [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4558.820000000001s)]
*  Whatever happened to joe biden is he's I mean that I [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4565.620000000001s)]
*  I'm not making fun of him. I feel I feel sorry. I do see I do too, but i've never seen anyone disappear faster [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4569.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, then joe biden. Do you never heard a word? I wonder what his attitude is towards [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4576.66s)]
*  the obama family right now towards barack obama because [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4580.82s)]
*  Joe biden certainly would have been a more compelling candidate than hillary clinton in 2016 [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4584.66s)]
*  And so this guy has had this life dream [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4590.42s)]
*  He's worked his entire life became a senator was elected like at the age of 30 or 29 or whatever [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4592.66s)]
*  And then when he's elected and he was turned 30 [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4597.139999999999s)]
*  Who has aspired his entire life over the span of decades beginning long before I was born over 50 years for this for this job [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4600.179999999999s)]
*  I mean like significantly longer than I was born this man has been a u.s senator and aspired to be [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4607.3s)]
*  U.s president to say that finally when his turn came around in 2015 [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4612.9s)]
*  After faithfully serving as a vice president or whatever to say that no no for eight years for eight years going through that ignominy [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4618.42s)]
*  And then to have to have [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4625.48s)]
*  Hillary clinton to say no, no, no, it's it's not your time. And then finally he just says okay after hillary loses [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4628.28s)]
*  I'm just going to do this myself. Anyway [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4633.48s)]
*  By hell or high water. That's a whole separate discussion gets his way into the white house [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4636.36s)]
*  And then to say the same guy comes back [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4640.76s)]
*  And you know, who knows if the if the reporting on this is true, but effectively threatens to have him [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4643.639999999999s)]
*  constitutionally removed from office and to lead a coup [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4650.66s)]
*  Unless you bend the knee the same guy only to then watch again the woman instead who this time was nominated [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4654.12s)]
*  The last time was Hillary clinton this time. It's comel eras [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4660.92s)]
*  Fail at the very mission that you otherwise run. I know I cannot even begin to fathom what that what that feels like he is [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4664.2s)]
*  surely [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4671.96s)]
*  the happiest [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4673.08s)]
*  Person about the election result on tuesday night in america, right? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4674.44s)]
*  Because he's at least personally maybe him or jill biden [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4677.4s)]
*  Yeah, his wife are are the had to have been the two most [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4680.44s)]
*  You know shadenfreude relieved americans totally right, but it's it's it's in how is he doing? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4684.92s)]
*  I don't know. Does that help if you're going through like a state of cognitive decline? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4691.5599999999995s)]
*  Does something like that as painful as that is does that sense of? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4696.5199999999995s)]
*  aggrievement and [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4701.46s)]
*  Desire for vengeance that could kind of sharpen you maybe it does because it did seem like he actually got a little bit [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4703.32s)]
*  Sharper actually after he was yanked up. It's like part of him [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4709.16s)]
*  It's like part of him came back right and so his wife were red on election day. Oh, did she? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4713.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he wore a maga hat. Yeah [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4719.96s)]
*  you know it's not like they were they were they were hiding it too much, but um [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4722.679999999999s)]
*  You know, it's [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4727.08s)]
*  It's just a fascinating thing. It's neither critical nor not. It's just it's just interesting sociologically and just psychologically [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4728.679999999999s)]
*  What about the rest of the party like if you I mean well you failed you ran for president and didn't get elected [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4734.52s)]
*  And I know for because I talked to you about it. There was a time after you thought okay, you know, what did I do? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4740.76s)]
*  Right. What did I do wrong where you take on a stock of your own behavior? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4745.96s)]
*  Because that's that's what it is to grow that's called adulthood. Yeah, is there a moment like that for the democratic party? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4750.52s)]
*  Do you think I think I hope there is actually i'm kind of rooting for that because that'd be better for the country [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4756.120000000001s)]
*  I mean the number one person who's [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4760.76s)]
*  Responsible for whether or not you achieve your goal is you actually there's a lot of other factors you can blame [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4763.62s)]
*  Of course, but yeah [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4768.360000000001s)]
*  the number one determinant of whether you achieve what you set out to achieve is you and that applies to the level of an [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4769.24s)]
*  Individual and if your team is a political party in american politics, then that's true for for your team, right? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4774.04s)]
*  They they were responsible for their own failure and demise [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4779.96s)]
*  I saw some interesting things over the last day and it hasn't it hasn't been as like monolithically crazy as I expected [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4783.16s)]
*  I expected everybody just in lockstep in the same way to go the same direction of you know threat to democracy [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4790.759999999999s)]
*  Authoritarianism has reached america and we're seeing certainly a lot of that. That's like 90 of it [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4797.62s)]
*  but I think there were um, I think some thoughtful moments of [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4801.96s)]
*  Reflection of you know, a few folks like I think um, I don't know this guy, but someone sent me his tweet. Um [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4806.74s)]
*  Does does iglesias sound right? Yeah, he had something thoughtful like I in my campaign I had um, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4813.8s)]
*  I had 10 truths 10 things that are true that I lay out that was kind of the centerpiece of my campaign [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4819.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you might remember they said to me he had nine today [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4823.4s)]
*  But like he left it like he forgot number 10 was the joke that somebody sent me [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4826.599999999999s)]
*  But actually I read them and it was they were all smart and reasonable. You saw this [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4830.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like matt why glasius at all, but I must say [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4834.44s)]
*  Oh, I saw I saw i'm a non-fan and i'm willing to admit that all nine of them were great [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4838.44s)]
*  Actually, yeah, it actually it actually [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4844.5199999999995s)]
*  The u.s. Government exists for the benefit of its citizens. Yeah. Yeah, exactly stuff like that. It was stuff that was not [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4847.4s)]
*  Too dissimilar from what you or I might say about our vision for what I totally agree [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4854.5199999999995s)]
*  Should be, you know, I disagree with some of the stuff on there the framing of it [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4859.24s)]
*  He said what is he said something about climate change? Like I just think the whole agenda is is artificial [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4861.88s)]
*  He said well climate change is real, but it's not a goal in itself [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4866.599999999999s)]
*  It is a means to the end of doing what's better for humanity and I said that framing was I agree was [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4870.28s)]
*  At least like as a framing matter the right way to look at it [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4875.4s)]
*  and so [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4879.24s)]
*  If that's evidence to say that even within a period of 48 hours [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4880.6s)]
*  You can at least have thoughtful voices on the other side who are willing to look themselves in the mirror [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4884.04s)]
*  admit failure [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4889.96s)]
*  Inquire about the nature of the screw-up and maybe even begin to offer some path forward [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4891.88s)]
*  I think that actually leaves me [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4897.16s)]
*  I'm just you know, i'm i'm of all the times you and i've gotten together [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4899.24s)]
*  I'm probably in like the most hopeful mood i've actually ever been in right now [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4901.96s)]
*  And i'm hopeful for the future of the republican party. I'm hopeful for the future of our country [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4906.36s)]
*  But like a weird part of me is almost hopeful for the future of the democratic party based on oh I agree [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4911.16s)]
*  Oh either that or they're gonna have to go the way the harvard and yale that we talked about earlier either that or they die [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4918.28s)]
*  Right, so it's either evolve or die as someone who's been fired a lot [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4923.08s)]
*  I can say there's nothing better for you than failure [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4926.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know there's oh, it's in fact, it's essential you yeah, yeah, because you'll never reassess, you know [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=4929.32s)]

*  uh [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5042.28s)]

*  Was and what his significance will be going forward huge. Um, I actually haven't known him for that long [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5047.0s)]
*  I only got to know him last year [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5052.84s)]
*  He um, he gave me a dinner. I was at while I was running for president. We really hit it off [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5054.84s)]
*  I um [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5059.5599999999995s)]
*  I like people who are extremely intelligent and he is in the category of extreme [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5061.08s)]
*  intelligence he's somebody who [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5066.18s)]
*  Is able to not only able to but requires himself to be doing multiple different things at the same time [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5069.48s)]
*  And he's better individually at each of those things because he's also doing those other things at the same time [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5073.96s)]
*  But I think that his significance was [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5078.5199999999995s)]
*  twofold [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5081.4s)]
*  one is he really [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5082.84s)]
*  Expanded that permission structure we were talking about earlier for people who are elite in america people who define [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5086.66s)]
*  Their status based on the number of dollars in their bank account, which I think is probably the wrong way to look at your own [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5093.400000000001s)]
*  Status as a human being but you know, we all have our biases if the richest man in the world and the most successful self-made man [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5098.68s)]
*  In human history can publicly state his support for donald trump [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5105.88s)]
*  Then there's nothing stopping me from doing so if I believe that's the right answer and he's pretty darn smart actually [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5110.04s)]
*  so if this guy both can do it from a social perspective but also is [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5115.16s)]
*  As intelligent as he is to send rockets to outer space and back more intelligent than the u.s. Government has you know ever [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5120.04s)]
*  If he can kind of do the analysis and say that donald trump's gonna be the right choice for the future of the country [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5127.56s)]
*  Then you know what? Maybe I should do some simpler thinking of my own and have the courage to arrive at the same place [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5131.96s)]
*  so in terms of blowing out that permission structure like that was [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5138.200000000001s)]
*  Certainly what I consider to be one of my responsibilities over the last year, but the person who really blew that out [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5141.400000000001s)]
*  Bar none was elon when he came out publicly endorsed trump and I love the way he did it because it was clearly he was just [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5147.88s)]
*  Moved by the fact that okay. He was maybe thinking about it. Who knows who knows where exactly he was in his journey right there [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5154.68s)]
*  He and I talked at various points [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5161.0s)]
*  But I don't know that he was going to come out and publicly endorse trump in the way he did [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5162.6s)]
*  But there was this supernatural event. I do think it was it was a divine moment in american history [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5166.04s)]
*  Where we averted a natural disaster a national disaster by about two centimeters and elon just said okay, it's done [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5172.52s)]
*  I'm doing this [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5179.32s)]
*  He's an american hero and i'm endorsing him either that was number one number two was on just the execution of it, too [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5180.44s)]
*  In this election, I mean pennsylvania was it turns out donald trump would have won regardless [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5186.68s)]
*  But pennsylvania was the key that allowed us to really secure this victory and to just go in and say [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5191.56s)]
*  Got a lot of political consultants and a lot of people in traditional [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5197.72s)]
*  republican party [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5200.76s)]
*  Apparatuses who have you know tried to figure this stuff out and say no [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5202.66s)]
*  No, i'm just actually going to figure out myself directly and understand. Here's low propensity voters [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5205.8s)]
*  I'm going to personally go and talk to them myself. I'm going to spend nine figures or whatever [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5209.96s)]
*  It was in the end. I think it was at least nine figures [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5214.12s)]
*  To actually make sure that we get the job done and then get the job done. I think was [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5216.92s)]
*  was essential actually to this victory and so I hope he's [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5223.32s)]
*  An essential part going forward of saving the country and using this mandate [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5228.200000000001s)]
*  To shred to pieces that federal bureaucracy you and I talked about earlier [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5232.92s)]
*  And I hope he's you know doesn't lose his interest in american politics for a long time to come [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5237.64s)]
*  You know you and I think have been on the side of because because you hear this objection now coming up which actually infuriates me about [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5243.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, well, what about all of a sudden now after 14 years of being silent on this from the left? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5249.96s)]
*  We don't like this influence of money in politics well [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5255.240000000001s)]
*  Okay, trump got outspent three to one exactly three to one exactly exactly shut up in the swing states, right? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5258.52s)]
*  so so long as we have the game and I think that this is something for our side to [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5264.52s)]
*  You know man up into as well is [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5269.88s)]
*  If you're going to play the game like you got to compete actually and we can't just win this against [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5274.280000000001s)]
*  Against the so-called successful or elites or whatever [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5280.04s)]
*  No, I actually we are better off if we have our own [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5284.4400000000005s)]
*  Cadre of superhuman heroes who are able to with their own unique skills be they cultural leaders or business leaders or whatever? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5288.5s)]
*  to have our own version of [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5295.4800000000005s)]
*  Our you know special forces especially since nobody I mean I don't like most political donors [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5298.04s)]
*  I know them all and most of them have creepy agendas or they just want to be get their picture taken with a politician [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5303.08s)]
*  Which is like a very low motive in my view. Yeah, elon [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5308.28s)]
*  Not unique, but he's very unusual in that. He doesn't really want anything. Yeah, he doesn't really want anything [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5312.44s)]
*  I mean, he certainly doesn't need anything that well, that's what i'm saying a lot to lose [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5317.5599999999995s)]
*  But he certainly doesn't know he doesn't want anything for himself. Like he's not in it obviously not in it for the money [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5320.84s)]
*  Yeah, and there's something uniting about it. He was not a [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5325.8s)]
*  Conservative. I mean the whole trump phenomenon [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5329.54s)]
*  Is if you take three steps back unifying? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5332.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a unifying moment orthodox jews in brooklyn voting for donald trump [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5334.92s)]
*  You had muslims in southeast michigan voting for donald trump. It was awesome. You had [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5339.24s)]
*  Sugarcane workers the people who cut the cane in florida and the people who owned the ranches right all voting for donald trump [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5344.1s)]
*  You had north georgia, you know white rednecks and you had black men in atlanta all voting for trump [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5350.6s)]
*  Totally and then above them all is elon musk. Who's like just sort of this figure who's above politics. He's for trump [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5356.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. There's something. Yeah, it was it was part of it was it was in some ways [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5362.84s)]
*  In some ways you could say like you know, what was the causal link that he played if you're wearing your analytical hat [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5369.72s)]
*  I think it was huge. There's also some broader sense in which this was just [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5373.72s)]
*  Destined to happen. Totally. This was all just playing out. Oh, i'm with you like we're gonna have like a false [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5377.780000000001s)]
*  Analytical hubris here by just like dissecting exactly. No, no, but you're right. It was just it was just all destined to it [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5384.1s)]
*  Was gonna happen just gonna happen and this was all part of it playing out and you know, I think I like feel that [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5389.08s)]
*  I mean you were there when they won. No, and even just over the last year. I mean I [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5393.88s)]
*  And you know, i'm not meaning we would mean to commit the sin of flattening your face [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5399.5599999999995s)]
*  but I think one of the things I liked about our conversations [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5403.5599999999995s)]
*  and you know I um [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5407.16s)]
*  You know, I fashion you know fashion myself as as having some of this as well is [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5409.32s)]
*  Just having like a little bit of an intuition of where things are going a little bit like just like [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5413.32s)]
*  Just get a pulse of the country and and to sort of [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5419.0s)]
*  See it. I think you and I had what conversations over the last year where [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5422.12s)]
*  I think we were both on the same page about [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5426.76s)]
*  early on last year [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5429.88s)]
*  in like spring of 2023 [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5431.96s)]
*  Being both convinced that joe biden was not going to be the nominee. Yeah, that's right [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5435.16s)]
*  And then you said it many times and there's there's some darker. There's some darker ones in in yeah that you and I I think sadly [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5438.92s)]
*  Predicted but we're wrong about by two centimeters. Yes, exactly [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5446.280000000001s)]
*  Thankfully and you know even the idea that this was going to be a landslide you could just sort of feel it, right? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5450.04s)]
*  It was just it was just in the ether and so in some sense [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5455.4800000000005s)]
*  Like at our at our very best we might kind of smell it [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5458.52s)]
*  Coming but it was coming either way. No, I think so. I think the more we [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5462.92s)]
*  Remember that that actually is I think what's uniting actually once you see that that's really uniting the idea that [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5467.72s)]
*  It's not being done by us actually it's being done through us like that's a liberating feeling and [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5473.32s)]
*  in that sense [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5480.28s)]
*  You and I or any other everyday american is united with a you know, elon musk to donald trump like we're all part of [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5481.5599999999995s)]
*  I think a higher plan. It's being done through us. This was coming [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5488.679999999999s)]
*  It was going to happen one factor or not and you know in some ways we're all just playing our little [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5492.2s)]
*  Piece of a role in in playing out what was going to play out all along [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5498.84s)]
*  I can't improve on that. That's that's the greatest summation. I have heard of this election so far vick. Thank you very much [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAKGW2SxSxM&t=5503.48s)]
