# How Casey Putsch Built the Most Efficient Car in the World, and Why the EPA Hates Him for It
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490)
*  Okay, so here's my theory. The death of the US auto industry was a bigger deal than, I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=0.0s)]
*  think we realized, maybe a harbinger, hopefully not, but perhaps a harbinger of what happens [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=7.4s)]
*  to the country going forward. So Detroit dies and people are like, oh, Detroit's such a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=13.1s)]
*  mess. My wife is from there, so I've been there a lot. But you never thought that would [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=17.72s)]
*  happen to the rest of the country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=22.22s)]
*  Oh no, we're going similar ways. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=23.54s)]
*  We are. That's exactly right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=25.78s)]
*  Yeah. I live in the greater Toledo area and that's baby Detroit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=26.78s)]
*  Exactly. Home of Champion Spark plugs. No longer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  So I guess the question is if we want to prevent this from spreading with the cancer that it [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=53.3s)]
*  clearly is, I think it's important to know the cause of it. So why did the auto industry, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=58.88s)]
*  which was the most important non-defense industry we had, why did it die? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=64.14s)]
*  I would say largely regulation and the nature of trying to find more profit and where you [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=70.62s)]
*  ship things. It was a lack of pride in having a workforce in the future tomorrow. And those [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=74.8s)]
*  are the two things I would stick with. Because since, in my opinion, I've been a car guy [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=80.56s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=85.34s)]
*  You mentioned the unions. Everyone blames the unions for the destruction of Detroit. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=86.8s)]
*  I think that's a secondary symptom. I mean, that's a big thing, but I think culturally [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=92.36s)]
*  it has to do more with where we're going and what happened. I mean, the automotive [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=98.14s)]
*  industry right now, if you look at new cars, I don't own a new car. The newest vehicle [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  I own is early 2000s. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=106.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=107.54s)]
*  The newest. Yeah. And honestly, I've been thinking like that's too new. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=108.54s)]
*  And you're a professional car guy and you have no... [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no. I work on all my own stuff from exotics to building race cars, helping students [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=112.10000000000001s)]
*  building airplanes to vintage stuff. Like I know automotive history. And honestly, kind [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=116.2s)]
*  of the sweet spot for cars to daily drive are the 1980s and 1990s. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=124.68s)]
*  We've just gotten worse since then. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=125.68s)]
*  In what ways? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=129.16s)]
*  Consumer culture. You know, they try to find new ways to make money, give something to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  buy a new model year. But cars haven't really gotten any better since the 1990s. They're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=135.1s)]
*  coming in more like a cell phone. And then you get more and more and more regulation, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=140.36s)]
*  which just stymies the automotive industry into building just the one thing. It's why [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  all the cars look the same. That's why there's no real innovation. That's why anything interesting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=148.6s)]
*  ends up being wildly expensive. And then the two things that are always used as, shall [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  we say, the scapegoat is either the environment, the EPA, or safety. But it's not always about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=158.64s)]
*  that. And if you're really worried about safety... [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Wait, wait, those are scapegoats? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, not scapegoats, but reasons to force things into be a certain way. Because if you [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  speak up and question anything, they'll always say, environment, safety. It seems like that's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=172.44s)]
*  always the way. But we're always just quagmired in this regulation and direction. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=177.28s)]
*  You're blowing my mind. So I mean, getting older is a process of realizing how many of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  the lies you've internalized and believed. And I guess if you had asked me when I woke [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=187.76s)]
*  up this morning what destroyed Detroit, I would say, I'm not actually even that against [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=192.04s)]
*  unions to be honest with you, but I would say, well, everyone says the unions and EPA [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=197.0s)]
*  and safety. Ralph Nader and the EPA and the UAW. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=201.8s)]
*  True. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  But no. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  True. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  It's deeper, you're saying. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=208.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, it is. And okay, I'm an individual. I build stuff. I think about the nation, individuals, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  community, my family, my friends. We want a car that gets us there, that we can fix, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  that we can afford, right? But it's not what we're making. Another thing which I want to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=219.68s)]
*  mention, two points. The other thing that's happening nowadays is we don't really innovate [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  or make anything new anymore that people can afford really. And I'm finding another, it [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=229.88s)]
*  seems like a symptom across culture of just everything now is about money from one pocket [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=234.96s)]
*  to another. It's not about really creating something new or building tomorrow. And I [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=239.72s)]
*  started to see that in the automotive industry with the nature of hybrids to electric. They [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  have a purpose, but they're not a solution for everything. But the political push and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=250.6s)]
*  powers are trying to make it a solution for everything. And I look at this and go, no, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  no, no, no, no, this isn't about what's best for everybody or even the environment or anything. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=260.38s)]
*  This is money from one pocket to another and a power play. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  What does that mean, money from one pocket to another? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=268.38s)]
*  So it's kind of a, it's a deeper discussion that led to when I built what I called the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=270.94s)]
*  Omega car, which I built that high efficiency diesel car that I thought would be more recyclable, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=279.94s)]
*  environment impact, affordable, and a good car in a direction to go. And if I make, can I just [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=284.26s)]
*  back up a second, kind of what I saw. So, you know, my teens and twenties, I'm just a normal [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=290.38s)]
*  car guy. I liked fast cars and going on dates with pretty girls. That's pretty much all I cared [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  about. So fast cars and fast women. Well, they say in Kentucky, what is it they say? Beautiful [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  horses and fast women. No, I meant beautiful women and fast horses, nothing like that. But no, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=305.5s)]
*  that was kind of all I cared about. But my grandfather always talked about politics and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=310.62s)]
*  things going on in the world. And while I didn't really care so much to look into it, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=313.42s)]
*  things stuck with me. Yes. And I remember in, was it 2008, 2008, when Obama was running, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=316.3s)]
*  people are all excited. I'm like, okay. And I remember watching all the presidential stuff. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  That was kind of the first time I really started paying attention to politics when I was a younger [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=330.66s)]
*  guy. And we're watching the Democratic National Convention and Obama's talking. And I remember, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=334.62s)]
*  thinking this guy's full of crap. That's just my gut feeling. I didn't know where it came from. I [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=340.78s)]
*  didn't really know that much of politics, but I'm just like, this guy is full of crap. You [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=345.06s)]
*  didn't think he was black Jesus? No, no. I mean, you sound like a racist. I don't care. I don't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=348.14s)]
*  care. That's the spirit. So I just thought he's full of crap. And so I'm listening, get to the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=356.26s)]
*  point. And he goes, and I'll help Detroit retool. So the energy efficient cars of tomorrow will [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=360.74s)]
*  build here for the sake of the nation and world. I'm like, bullshit. You're not gonna, this isn't, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=365.78s)]
*  you're not doing a Kennedy speech like we're going to the moon for the decade is out. You're not [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=371.26s)]
*  going to do it. I just, I just, it just, it ticked me off. And I've remembered it to this day. And [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=374.61999999999995s)]
*  of course we have the- Why did you know he was not going to do it? Because Detroit's not going to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=379.7s)]
*  change. He's not going to change that. Like a politician changes their own oil, let alone know [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=385.05999999999995s)]
*  how a car works or the industry or what to do with it. Fair. Respectfully. Fair. Fair. No, with no [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=388.78s)]
*  respect, I would say. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=394.66s)]
*  No, I, you know, and, and I can think of some, you know, military leaders and such saying things [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=395.5s)]
*  that I'll be a little kinder about. We don't want to take advice from, you know, pantsuits in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=401.54s)]
*  Washington. It's like, what do they know about it? Respectfully, but things like that go across [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  the board. So I'm thinking he's not doing anything. Well, the other thing that interesting [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=410.26000000000005s)]
*  happened was the financial crisis 2008, 2009, right? Now, I didn't fully understand what was [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=414.18s)]
*  going on. Again, I cared more about going on dates and fast cars than politics and things going on [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  at the time. But the family business we had was a small town public golf course in the Midwest, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=424.54s)]
*  you know, 18 holes worked our butt off. My father worked seven days a week, six o'clock in the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  morning, 10 o'clock at night every day throughout the entire of the season. So we worked. I know [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  like being in a small town, everybody makes fun of you. Oh, you're rich. You just sit on a golf [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=437.22s)]
*  course all day. I'm like, no, we're changing oil and like diesel tractors and back lapping mowers [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=440.06s)]
*  and mowing and putting on banquets and doing family business, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=444.42s)]
*  What does it mean to back lap a mower? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=447.42s)]
*  Oh, sorry, that was so if you move a fairway or green, it's not a rotary blade that cuts by kind [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=448.58s)]
*  of like, whacking the right it's actually, it's a reel, which comes through and slices on a blade. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=455.38s)]
*  Yes. Well, they get they get dull. And so you have to sharpen them. And it's dirty and you beat up [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=461.09999999999997s)]
*  your knuckles. And that's kind of the work you actually do in the winter of the golf course. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=467.41999999999996s)]
*  By hand like with a file or? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=470.06s)]
*  Oh, no, you have to run them backwards with a dirty compound with like grid on it and have to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=471.62s)]
*  adjust it. Yeah, you laugh. Exactly. Exactly. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt. No, it's all right. I [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=478.7s)]
*  just kind of bring that up because that that was my world at the time. We worked hard and we saw [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=483.9s)]
*  that. But at that time, I started to see how it was affecting people in Little Tiffin, Ohio, on a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=487.38s)]
*  daily basis, loans, housing loans, business loans. And I also saw how that affected eventually when [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=495.38s)]
*  the family was thinking of selling the business. You couldn't get lending for something like that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=501.54s)]
*  And I started to see how that that hurt everything. But where I was going with it in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=507.38s)]
*  relation to the overarching things with the automotive industry. So now we're bailing out the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=510.54s)]
*  automotive industry, tax dollars, huge amounts of money. Okay. Huh? Paying attention. And I had [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=516.14s)]
*  lived in Columbus, Ohio at the time, head of my little shop working on vintage race cars and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=523.42s)]
*  things like that. And ride my motorcycle around. And after we were bailing out the automotive [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=527.86s)]
*  industries, I kind of remember back and I'm like, so wonder, is Obama gonna try to make everything [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=532.86s)]
*  efficient now? Are they gonna do anything? And I see us, we just kind of doubled down on making [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=537.6999999999999s)]
*  bigger trucks and muscle cars and things which I have to tell you, I love big trucks and muscle cars [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=543.26s)]
*  and fast cars. Okay, like, if you can afford the fuel and do what you want, don't don't get in my [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=548.4599999999999s)]
*  way. You can pry my sports cars out of my cold dead hands. Okay, don't. Yeah. But you know, doesn't [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=552.62s)]
*  mean I don't necessarily want something that could be better for as a daily driver. I can't think of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=557.22s)]
*  something that might be more efficient. So I was noticing that. And I'm thinking this is this is [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=560.54s)]
*  wrong. Something's wrong here. And just in what I was doing, and, you know, researching various [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=566.46s)]
*  materials and thinking of building cars, and it's kind of what I do, you know, I, I started to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=571.74s)]
*  realize there's a myriad of ways that we can mass produce cars, automobiles, that will be less [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=576.98s)]
*  toxic, less environmental impact, cheaper, more efficient than what we're doing. Because in a [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=584.74s)]
*  sense, all of our cars are stamped metal boxes with chairs bolted in them. Yeah, we've been doing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=589.02s)]
*  this since the mid 1930s. We have not much has changed. And it's been a long time. And I'll say [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=593.98s)]
*  this also, which I think you might enjoy as a history guy. So SR 71 Blackbird, right CIA spy [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=602.7s)]
*  plane Mach three. They came up with that in the late 1950s. We had to go to the trouble of getting [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=608.94s)]
*  all the titanium I think from Russia at the time, which required a zillion shell companies and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=616.4200000000001s)]
*  orchestration just to get the material to build it. And we build an aircraft effectively in the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=620.58s)]
*  late 1950s 1960 that'll do Mach three, and can map hundreds of 1000s of miles of the earth's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=624.86s)]
*  surface and before GPS existed, be able to plot the stars through broad daylight and through clouds [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=631.38s)]
*  in the late 50s. And we're still making cars like the 1930s. Now. I think that's BS. Yeah. So as to [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=638.82s)]
*  be fair, you've also seen the death of innovation in aviation as well. That's true, too. I mean, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=647.98s)]
*  the 747 came out in 1969. True. Tell me we've made it and I was born that year 55, six years ago. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=653.18s)]
*  When was the last time we built a plane that cool 1969? We haven't. And to be fair, there's a lot of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=660.3s)]
*  things that we still like the B 52 bomber, it's still around. Buff is eternal, they joke, you know, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=665.26s)]
*  and so there's a lot of great designs from back when that are still perfect designs now and can be [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=670.18s)]
*  upgraded. It doesn't mean that we have to have innovation for innovation sake, right? Some things [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=674.9799999999999s)]
*  just work. But sometimes you need new things. But as a younger guy at the time, I was, I was [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=679.5s)]
*  frustrated by all this. And I'm like, you know what, I'm going to build a car. I got a point to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=686.54s)]
*  prove. And my thinking at the time was, it can't be electric, because nobody knows what the heck a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=691.06s)]
*  kilowatt hour is back then. We're not accustomed to thinking like that. We think miles per gallon. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=697.5s)]
*  How fast is it at zero to 60? You know, things like that. That's kind of the two things that matter [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=702.1s)]
*  most to people. And can you use this? And how much does it cost? So like, okay, I want to build a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=706.26s)]
*  car that'll be representative of something that can be mass produced that let's say it costs about [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=711.86s)]
*  $20,000 or less, I made it diesel turbo diesel. So I looked around for what I felt was about the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=716.22s)]
*  most efficient engine reasonably available and built the car. Now I said something like 11 years [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=721.4200000000001s)]
*  ago on video, so I can prove it. I said it will get over 100 miles a gallon and it will do zero [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=727.34s)]
*  to 60 in under five seconds. Now, I built the car, I even showed it at a private like car event with [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=731.4200000000001s)]
*  sports cars and exotic cars and told everybody about my concept. But when I got it all together [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=738.9s)]
*  and done, I realized I don't have a voice. Like, what am I gonna do with this thing? If the world [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=743.1s)]
*  doesn't know it exists, and nobody hears about it, it doesn't exist. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=749.26s)]
*  You felt like Nikolai Tesla at this point, I'm sure. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=752.3000000000001s)]
*  Perhaps. I don't maybe I you know, he's a he's an interesting character. Yeah, for sure. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=754.66s)]
*  Certainly. And I sat on it. I just put it in my garage for better part of a decade. Because I [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=759.58s)]
*  didn't have a voice. But other things going on in life. I was doing my nonprofit genius garage, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=765.62s)]
*  which I really believed in because we can go into some big problems American educational system, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=771.1s)]
*  yeah, especially higher education. I think we're stymieing our youth, the families in the future. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=774.8199999999999s)]
*  And I think it comes from predatory lending and loans you can't default on. And I think the schools [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=779.02s)]
*  are creating this vacuum monster that is not the real world with majors that are not providing jobs [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=783.66s)]
*  and creating an environment for political radicalization. But that's another topic. But [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=790.74s)]
*  the reason I say everything you just said is, is obvious. And it's crazy that it still exists. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=796.26s)]
*  But let me just back up to the vehicle itself. Yes. Yes. And I was getting boring. I was coming [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=801.18s)]
*  back to that. What explain how you get 100 miles to the gallon on diesel. And it goes zero to 60 [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=805.06s)]
*  and under five seconds. Like how how what is that? How big is the motor? Like tell us about the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  car. Let me ask you a question. Yeah. So I don't I don't know what you drove here. And but let's [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=815.74s)]
*  pick your average car SUV. Yeah. Put it in neutral. How hard is it to push it? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=820.18s)]
*  Pretty, pretty hard. Pretty hard. Right? Yeah. Like I know it sounds silly. But when you work on [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=826.06s)]
*  cars, if you spend your day pushing around cars, you start thinking about how efficient they are. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=830.22s)]
*  Look at look at a car and it should be going down the road or semi. How aerodynamic do you think [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=835.34s)]
*  that is? Not super aerodynamic. No, I drive a Silverado. Not dynamic. There's nothing about our [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=839.5s)]
*  cars that are remotely efficient at all. So how do you how do you get that? You just make the actual [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=846.5400000000001s)]
*  car not so much the drivetrain. You're not looking for a magic bullet. Everybody wants a magic bullet. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=852.82s)]
*  You make the car more efficient. Like the lower coefficient of drag, somewhat lighter weight where [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=857.6999999999999s)]
*  you don't need weight, just less rolling resistance, you make it actual efficient, good design. We [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=864.7399999999999s)]
*  don't do that with the automotive industry anymore. And the reason I chose diesel is because people [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=870.9799999999999s)]
*  would understand that. Diesel is also a very flexible fuel. We can make biodiesel. You can make [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=874.7399999999999s)]
*  diesel effectively out of what's left over from the meatpacking industry, the wine making [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=880.9399999999999s)]
*  industry, agriculture, you name it. And, and this is fascinating too, because, and I got to get [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=885.26s)]
*  into why I talked about the car. But since that time, I got word back from people kind of more [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=890.9399999999999s)]
*  in traditional automotive media and whatnot, no one would talk about it or write about it. And I'm [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=896.38s)]
*  kind of pissed me off. Because back when I was in a concept, and I just talked about it a little bit [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=900.9399999999999s)]
*  on my YouTube channel, some places will report about it. But why is it when it was just a concept [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=904.7s)]
*  and a YouTuber was trying to do something efficient, and like maybe eco-friendly and whatnot, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=909.26s)]
*  they'd write about it. But then when it actually did what I said it was going to do, they wouldn't. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=913.98s)]
*  So it actually gets 100 miles to the gallon. Yeah, for first time out, I didn't even have all the [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=918.46s)]
*  fairings on it. I haven't even tuned it. It was 104.72 miles a gallon just driving to the countryside [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=922.3000000000001s)]
*  normally with stop signs and turns and such. Just just jumping in without even tuning it more. The [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=927.74s)]
*  first time I took it out, we were just idling and doing hard pulls and everything else. I looked at [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=932.14s)]
*  I'm like, we just got like 88 miles a gallon and we're not even trying. That's crazy. Well, and the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=936.0600000000001s)]
*  other thing considering gas is pretty towards like three bucks or something. Yeah, right here. Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=941.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's expensive. It's more expensive in Europe. And like, like, okay, I have some gas [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=946.06s)]
*  guzzlers for sure. I like V12s and stick shifts and straight pipes. So tell me about the engine [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=950.86s)]
*  in this vehicle. It's largely conventional. It's turbo, which is good for diesel because it allows [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=955.18s)]
*  you some flexibility to cruise more. But if you want to make power, you can crank in the boost and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=960.6999999999999s)]
*  do some things to make it efficient. And I experimented even with some catalytic converters [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=966.14s)]
*  and such that will even be better. So there's nothing crazy about the drivetrain. There's no [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=970.46s)]
*  magic bullet there. What about the other thing? I got to point this out. That drivetrain when I [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=976.46s)]
*  started had 130,000 miles on it. It's no spring chicken. What was it from? What'd you call it out [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=980.46s)]
*  of Volkswagen? Pre diesel gate. Diesel gate is an interesting thing to talk about too. But what's [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=986.46s)]
*  diesel gate? That was the big scandal that Volkswagen went through with allegedly cheating [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=992.7800000000001s)]
*  their emissions. Oh, I remember this. Yes. That was back in 2015, I think. Right. That was a big [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=998.94s)]
*  scandal, which is interesting because in looking back on it now, it seems to tie into more with [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1005.74s)]
*  not regulating a car company so much for the betterment of all, but an attack. That's the way [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1014.3000000000001s)]
*  it kind of looks like to me. An attack on Volkswagen. I would say diesel because Volkswagen was [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1021.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't know about now, but certainly was the best and most efficient. The engine I used was from back [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1029.3400000000001s)]
*  in like 2000 when they made it. Volkswagen. Yeah. Good engine. And it's manual, more efficient that way. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1033.5s)]
*  The transmission's manual? Yeah, manual. Less parasitic losses. It's just cheaper to produce, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1040.6200000000001s)]
*  gets better miles to the gallon. And back in the day, sports cars, if they were manual, would have [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1045.74s)]
*  better zero to 60 times and such. No longer true. Yeah, no longer true. Our automatics have gotten a [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1052.14s)]
*  lot more interesting and whatnot. But manual transmission still makes for more efficient driving. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1056.62s)]
*  Yeah, because there's less parasitic drag. There's less losses in the drive train. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1062.86s)]
*  Interesting. Meaningfully more efficient? Well, especially in that time in the 2000s, probably [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1067.9799999999998s)]
*  could be five to seven miles to the gallon on the highway. Oh, wow. Maybe only like three, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1075.5s)]
*  but it's still a lot. When you consider millions of cars over years. For sure. Even your car. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1081.1s)]
*  And it doesn't all have to just be about like, oh, we have to do this for the sake of environment. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1086.38s)]
*  These are costs that hit people's pockets. Oh, I wasn't thinking about emissions even. Yeah. So, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1090.78s)]
*  well, that's amazing. So, and what about emissions on this vehicle? I'm trying to get to like- [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1097.1s)]
*  In regard to mine or the whole scandal. It's the basic stuff that diesel would have. I mean, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1101.74s)]
*  you've got a pretty serious catalytic converter. You've got the exhaust gas regulation and such. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1106.86s)]
*  That without getting an overly nitty gritty, diesel does have some things about it that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1112.7800000000002s)]
*  the EPA likes to go after. But it's kind of strange. And I'm curious to see what happens [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1121.42s)]
*  in the future. So you probably, I'm sure you saw this. Supreme court ruled differently on the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1126.46s)]
*  Chevron deference. Of course. Which I'm really fascinated to see how that changes the nature of [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1133.02s)]
*  the way laws are interpreted. So the bottom, the question before the court was, can federal agencies [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1139.02s)]
*  create legislation when the constitution says, no, Congress creates the laws. Right. On how it's [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1147.18s)]
*  interpreted. Right. But for generations, the federal agencies, including EPA, but all of them, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1152.86s)]
*  from the Department of Education to the Department of Defense, have come out with regulations that [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1159.02s)]
*  have the force of law that no one ever voted for and that no elected official had a hand in. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1163.98s)]
*  So it's anti-democratic, right? That's probably the reason why so many friends complain about the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1169.66s)]
*  ATF. I think they're pretty good at making laws. Well, the ATF has all kinds of other problems, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1173.98s)]
*  like shooting innocent people. But yes, no, absolutely. But they create regulations that [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1178.38s)]
*  no one voted on and that no elected official administers. So it's like, as a citizen, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1185.18s)]
*  I have no recourse, so that's not democracy, that's tyranny. Yeah. That's the conceptual. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1190.3799999999999s)]
*  No, exactly right. Exactly right. And it's not looking for a way around something or a loophole, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1195.18s)]
*  but what is right? What are we actually doing here? Where are we going? Also, if you want a law, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1200.3799999999999s)]
*  vote on it. Yeah. And the beauty of the Congress is they have two or six years between elections. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1203.6599999999999s)]
*  So they're pretty accountable to voters. And if voters don't like the way they vote, they can [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1210.94s)]
*  turn them out, at least conceivably, right? One hopes. One hopes. But the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1214.1399999999999s)]
*  undersecretary of douchebaggery is completely beyond the control of any voter. So like, that's [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1218.94s)]
*  again, tyranny, right? Yes. Yeah. And that affects things greatly. Because when you overregulate [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1226.86s)]
*  things, it just makes it difficult to innovate or go anywhere. Right. And the thing of it is, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1234.1399999999999s)]
*  so going back to the car, the car I built, so I mentioned you got 104.72 miles to go. And I [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1240.94s)]
*  video recorded the whole thing because I want to know what does this thing actually do? Because [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1246.54s)]
*  last year was a very important year. It was an election year. One thing that also drove me nuts. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1249.98s)]
*  So if you look at, so the Biden administration and even Gavin Newsom's pushing it, electric vehicle [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1255.58s)]
*  mandates, like large electric vehicle mandates, not like back to the Clinton era when it was like, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1260.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't know, one to 2% of vehicles sold by certain times need to be electric. No, they're big ones. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1265.18s)]
*  And I had a huge problem with Biden's administration doing that because I'm like, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1270.1399999999999s)]
*  this destroys innovation. And the other thing you go into, and I don't want to beat up on electric [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1274.54s)]
*  because it has its purpose in places. I think all kinds of drive trains and energy do. I don't mean [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1279.1s)]
*  that it's just like political BS rhetoric. I mean that genuinely, but it's not a Band-Aid fix. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1284.54s)]
*  Well, so how are we going to charge them? Our grid? Yeah. How? I'll tell you this. So I did [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1290.62s)]
*  some math with all this. Let me tell you this. So the next day, I'm coming right back to this point [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1295.58s)]
*  on the math. The next day after I did the initial mile per gallon testing on my car, I did zero to [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1301.66s)]
*  60 times with it. So I put accelerometers and GPS in this car. Also my 93 Dodge Viper RG10, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1306.22s)]
*  C7 Corvette Grand Sport, and my neighbor's Tesla Model 3 rear wheel drive with the full charge. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1313.26s)]
*  My car, they got 104 miles a gallon, beat the Dodge Viper by two tenths of a second and exactly [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1319.26s)]
*  matched the Corvette Grand Sport and the Tesla. Damn. That's without like computerized traction [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1323.5800000000002s)]
*  control. It's me just driving it. Everybody loves and appreciates first responders. When things go [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1329.1s)]
*  haywire, they're the ones who show up and make you safe, protect you, not just you, but the entire [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1334.9399999999998s)]
*  country. Most people agree they're heroes, but what happens if they can't show up? First responders [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1340.1399999999999s)]
*  cannot be everywhere all the time. And if there's an emergency, particularly a big emergency, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1347.1799999999998s)]
*  there aren't enough to go around. So you have to be your own first responder. Before an ambulance [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1352.9399999999998s)]
*  arrives, before a doctor can help, it is up to you to protect yourself and your family. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1357.42s)]
*  And if it's a medical emergency, you could be out of luck because you don't have the right [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1361.9s)]
*  medications. Most people do not have the medications they need at home. There's an answer to that. It's [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1365.66s)]
*  called the JACE case. It's a simple but smart solution to a problem most people don't even [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1372.14s)]
*  think about. It's a set of emergency prescriptive medications curated by medical experts. You've [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1375.8200000000002s)]
*  got peace of mind knowing that no matter what happens, you are totally prepared. Even if you're [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1381.98s)]
*  a prepared kind of person with stuff stored in your cellar, you probably don't have the right [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1387.66s)]
*  medications. What if there's an infection or any kind of crisis and you don't have access to first [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1392.78s)]
*  responders? You're going to want a JACE case, medications on hand when they matter most. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1399.82s)]
*  Go to JACE.com and use code TUCKER at checkout for a discount. JACE, J-A-S-E dot com, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1406.1399999999999s)]
*  checkout code TUCKER. So what was zero to sixty in that? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1413.4199999999998s)]
*  Four point six one. I probably could have done better, but honestly, the tires are over a decade [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1416.94s)]
*  old now because I built the car a while ago and such. But that was real world driving. And yeah, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1421.02s)]
*  I gave it and I got videos of it. If you would look me up. How did you beat the Tesla? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1425.5s)]
*  It matched the Tesla, but that was only with the Tesla to full charge. It would consistently get a [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1429.4199999999998s)]
*  little slower every time as it would lose juice. Just because the nature, obviously, of an electric [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1433.66s)]
*  vehicle just gives you massive advantage. And the Tesla is simple. You just stick your foot down and [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1438.78s)]
*  computers. That's the best it's going to do. My car would actually probably beat it if I gave it [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1443.3400000000001s)]
*  some clever traction control and such in it, to be honest. But that's not the point. The point of it [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1448.22s)]
*  is, so I'm like, I'm going to run some numbers just out of curiosity. What is the carbon footprint [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1453.42s)]
*  of burning one gallon of diesel? Oh, interesting. OK, EPA has got numbers for that. OK, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1460.46s)]
*  what's the carbon footprint on average, United States electrical generation, whether it's nuclear [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1464.6200000000001s)]
*  and coal, whatever, national average of the carbon footprint of a kilowatt hour of electricity? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1469.1000000000001s)]
*  Say like you're in a perfect world charging your electric vehicle at home. And then I just did the [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1475.1000000000001s)]
*  basic math on, OK, what's the carbon footprint of my car on diesel getting over 100 miles a gallon [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1480.06s)]
*  versus the electric car charged at home national average over 100 miles. My car beat the electric [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1485.18s)]
*  car at a lower carbon footprint. And it has much lower one to manufacture and it's easier to fix. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1490.78s)]
*  So that's when I went, OK, I also did some other fun math, respectfully towards coal. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1498.54s)]
*  But hold on, just to be fair, can it be turned off by remote by a politician who doesn't like [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1504.8600000000001s)]
*  your politics? Thank you. No, it can't. Oh, it can't. No, it can't. Then I don't feel comfortable [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1509.66s)]
*  with it. Oh, you don't? Well, how are we going to control you? I don't care. You're not. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1513.74s)]
*  It's going to stay that way. I like your spirit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, thank you for bringing that [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1516.9399999999998s)]
*  up. That's very important because the other thing about- That's why I drive a 1987. Well done, sir. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1521.58s)]
*  Yeah. For real. No, I get it. With the gun in it. Yeah, good. Good. Sorry, I shouldn't say that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1526.62s)]
*  I get too excited on that. But it's true. You remember the days of school, like you could have [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1532.86s)]
*  a gun rack because people were reasonable human beings in the community. I grew up in the middle [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1536.9399999999998s)]
*  way in California. We didn't have a lot of deer hunting there. Right. With surfboards and stuff. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1540.22s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But now you can still do it. I kind of get my independent spirit. I'm like, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1543.9s)]
*  I'm going to put a gun rack in my Viper, not because I need it, just because. Yeah. America. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1548.78s)]
*  You know? I totally agree. But, and that's the other thing about the electric car. So when I [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1552.6200000000001s)]
*  look at it, all the governmental control and what it appears to me globally is going on with much of [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1557.9s)]
*  that in the push. And then the other thing that doesn't make any sense. So the Biden administration [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1564.06s)]
*  doing the big electric vehicle mandates and such and push, but excluding Tesla from their meetings [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1567.58s)]
*  at the White House and summit and all that. Really? So what you're telling me is the thing [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1573.5s)]
*  that you want to do with industry and cars and transportation is super important, but not as [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1577.58s)]
*  important as the politics with the guy with the biggest electric car company in the world? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1583.34s)]
*  I don't like that either. Well, they're just criminals. I mean, we know that now. That was [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1587.74s)]
*  a criminal organization running our country. I know. I think a lot of my grandmother, who was, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1590.9399999999998s)]
*  married my World War II vet granddad, of course, she always said, give them a fair trial and hang [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1596.3000000000002s)]
*  them in the morning. And that phrase has been ringing in my mind a lot lately. She sounds like [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1600.22s)]
*  my kind of woman. So, but let me, let me just back a little bit. So you create this vehicle [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1604.22s)]
*  in your shop, right? Yeah. Okay. And you think that you could build it for 20 grand? Is that [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1609.5s)]
*  true? Okay. 20 grand. So it gets a hundred and four mass produced, of course, at scale. Not, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1616.8600000000001s)]
*  not as a prototype. Obviously. So, but it does, it gets a hundred and four miles per gallon. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1622.38s)]
*  It matches the Tesla off the line. You get to 16 under five seconds. So that's like kind of the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1629.66s)]
*  dream package right there. And it runs on a readily available fuel that you can buy at any. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1636.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And I only put a, we have the infrastructure for it. Well, yeah, you can fill it up at a gas [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1640.0600000000002s)]
*  station. I only put a five gallon tank in it because at a hundred miles a gallon, like I'm [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1645.8200000000002s)]
*  going to need to get out and, you know, have the call of nature or stop at a gas station before. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1649.58s)]
*  But if I put a bigger gas tank on, I can drive from New York to LA. And on one tank. Yeah, of course. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1653.1799999999998s)]
*  Okay. Now I have to point this out because there's lots of smart people watching. They'll get it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1661.82s)]
*  Okay. Things like crash testing, airbags, climate control, all that jazz. Okay, great. It'll add a [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1666.9399999999998s)]
*  few hundred pounds more to it. Maybe I'll make the car a little bit better. But the other thing [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1673.82s)]
*  that happens when you actually develop and build something like that, you tune it better. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1677.18s)]
*  I still can get those numbers and meet all of those same. Okay. So can I just ask like at that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1681.3400000000001s)]
*  point, it's like, if you invent something that is truly useful and that, you know, at 20 grand ish, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1686.38s)]
*  a new suburban is like pushing a hundred grand right now, like the cars are out of control. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1695.98s)]
*  Who can afford that? I couldn't agree more. If you're spending that much money on a car, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1699.5s)]
*  go buy a vintage Ferrari or something, you know? I don't know that I've ever bought a new car in [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1702.38s)]
*  my life, and I don't plan to, but people want to, whatever, leaving that a whole aside. But [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1705.5s)]
*  what you just described is something that like almost by definition would be successful. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1710.06s)]
*  So why can't you find someone to build it at scale? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1714.94s)]
*  Well, it's 2025 and we live in a wonderful country, but one that has involved into [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1719.74s)]
*  a lot of industrial complexes and they don't like change. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1728.14s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, you know, no one wants AI. We're getting it anyway. Well, yeah, but. Right? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1731.5s)]
*  We're getting massive change. It's power. That's power and control and money and they can do it [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1741.18s)]
*  and they will, which I have to say one thing, which I think you may appreciate. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1746.06s)]
*  AI effectively is a synthetic God that we're creating. Oh, of course. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1751.18s)]
*  How much of a biblical warning disaster is that? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1755.74s)]
*  Oh, you don't have to dig too deep to be. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1759.74s)]
*  We're destroying the entirety of the human experience. I just wanted to say that. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1762.54s)]
*  And people themselves, right? Replacing human beings. I know that'll end well. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1765.58s)]
*  Apex of the golden calf. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1769.1799999999998s)]
*  And by the way, I've done, I don't know how many interviews on the topic of AI around the world. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1770.4599999999998s)]
*  I've been to a lot of different countries to learn just for myself more about what's happening [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1774.3s)]
*  there. And the one question that no one can answer is like, what's the benefit of this? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1778.4599999999998s)]
*  Like, you know, control for others. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1783.18s)]
*  Yeah. None of the benefits. Yeah, whatever. I don't want to sound like an old guy, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1786.6200000000001s)]
*  but I feel like one when I hear this topic. So, but anyway, just back to the point, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1790.94s)]
*  like why specific? So you've been talking about this on your podcast on YouTube. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1796.46s)]
*  Yeah, my YouTube channel. Yeah. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1801.5s)]
*  And which has a lot of viewers. And why has no one called you to say, you know, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1803.1000000000001s)]
*  I'll friendship a couple hundred million bucks and we'll just build a facility and. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1807.66s)]
*  The difficulty with things like this is so. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1813.26s)]
*  Okay. First of all, you think, how do you do that? Okay. With what I'm talking about is not [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1816.3799999999999s)]
*  something that can be reasonably just scaled from a garage. Like, what am I going to do? Just build [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1819.98s)]
*  a few little ones here, sell them out. I would buy one. You got to do something. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1823.98s)]
*  Selling one. I would buy. What's it look like? I'm so it's such a bad interviewer. I haven't even [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1827.02s)]
*  asked the basic. It's pretty cool. Can you describe it? Give me a word picture. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1831.82s)]
*  Try things. It quite looks like it. It's slippery. It looks like a cross between an exotic car and [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1837.6599999999999s)]
*  a little bit of a Bonneville salt flats car. Wow. You didn't mention Cybertruck. Does it have [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1844.2199999999998s)]
*  hard lines? No. Really? Well, I'd like it to be efficient. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1848.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh. Rather than just interesting for aesthetic [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1855.4199999999998s)]
*  state. Respectfully. I don't mean that as a dig. No, I'm not attacking the cyber. I personally [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1858.54s)]
*  think it's incredibly unattractive. It's a Cybertruck. Yes. I just like the mean. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1864.06s)]
*  And I respect the Cybertruck, by the way. I did a Cybertruck review. I think it's a really [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1869.1s)]
*  interesting vehicle. I'm glad it exists. But I'm just saying aesthetically. Yeah. It's pretty good [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1872.3799999999999s)]
*  looking. It's a little different because we're accustomed to seeing what we're seeing. Too many [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1878.06s)]
*  angles for me. Oh, no. I was talking about my car, not the Cybertruck. Okay. Sorry. I'm obsessed. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1881.98s)]
*  No, the Cybertruck, the best meme is there's a DeLorean and an F117 Nighthawk, right? And [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1886.3799999999999s)]
*  F117 is like the military guy and DeLorean is kind of like the mom. And the Nighthawk is like, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1892.38s)]
*  what do you mean he's my son? He doesn't look anything like me. And they show the Cybertruck [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1897.74s)]
*  and he's like, oh. I'm more like 1935 Packard. Just soft lines. I have a 31 Buick Phaeton. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1901.98s)]
*  Is it pretty? Yes, very. Yeah, of course it is. So anyway, I keep interrupting you. Tell me what [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1910.3000000000002s)]
*  it looks like. What would you compare it to? Something that people might like? Well, it's [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1915.3400000000001s)]
*  mid-engine. Okay. So the engine's within the wheelbase, but behind the cockpit. It's two seat. It [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1919.26s)]
*  has butterfly doors similar to like a McLaren F1 in that regard. It was efficient. It has something [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1925.58s)]
*  of an open tail because it was very important the way the air flows around it, but also underneath [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1931.82s)]
*  it so that I can make it highly efficient. So the bottom of the, it's a monocoque structure where [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1936.94s)]
*  it's not like a tube frame with a body stuck on it. The whole car is itself the structure as well. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1944.54s)]
*  So the air, the way it flows over it through the radiator in the back also to the heating of the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1950.3s)]
*  motor and the way that then intersects the trailing edge and the way the air flows around it. It's [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1955.18s)]
*  just all designed to be design efficient. Sounds amazing. And you can even use the structure of the [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1959.74s)]
*  shall we the chassis or the structure. So I can even make the stereo system very small and [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1966.86s)]
*  effective and efficient because naturally acoustically it works out well for that too. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1971.82s)]
*  So it's a lot of fun with design. I just, every once in a while you need somebody who looks around [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1975.82s)]
*  at the world and goes, this is wrong. We can do better. I can do better. I'm going to do better. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1981.82s)]
*  And that's, that's just. So you build this thing. Can you register it? Yeah. Just like go to the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1987.1s)]
*  DMV and register. Yeah. It's registered no different than like an assembled vehicle or kick car. There's [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1992.78s)]
*  a lot of ways that are modified vehicle. It's just like and make car image. Yeah. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=1996.62s)]
*  Huh. Amazing. Um, car guy stuff. What do people say when you drive it around? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2002.3s)]
*  I keep it relatively under wraps because respectfully for as much time as it took me to [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2009.02s)]
*  build and what it represents, it's, I consider it kind of valuable to trust out there in the [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2012.54s)]
*  wild with people on their cell phones and stuff. So I kind of go with a low profile, but people are [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2016.3799999999999s)]
*  definitely interested in enamored by it. But they're not beating down your door. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2023.58s)]
*  Correct. And that was the other interesting thing. So nobody reported on it, even though, you know, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2027.4199999999998s)]
*  I got a few hundred thousand views on it when I said everything I wanted to say and show it. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2033.34s)]
*  It did the numbers, right? I would think if somebody builds a diesel car that represents [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2037.34s)]
*  being affordable and recyclable mass produce, that gets great fuel efficiency and has a low [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2042.2199999999998s)]
*  carbon impact and all people would be into that. Well, one word I got back from an automotive media [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2046.86s)]
*  was telling, they said, we don't report on dirty diesel. And the other was diesel's dead. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2051.66s)]
*  And I thought about that and I go, hang on. Diesel's like one of the most used fuels there are. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2057.18s)]
*  Who wrote that? Um, it was said it wasn't written. It was said to us. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2062.94s)]
*  But these are like professional car reviewers? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2067.2599999999998s)]
*  Correct. They won't touch it. They won't write about it. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2069.1s)]
*  Why do, this is obviously a much deeper question, but why do the worst people in the world, the most [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2072.54s)]
*  small minded, the stupidest, the meanest, the people with like the most unbalanced, unhealthy [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2076.94s)]
*  personal lives, why do they all go into journalism? Do you think? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2083.02s)]
*  That's a better question for you. But I don't know. I've been pondering this for like 35 years. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2086.7000000000003s)]
*  I didn't understand it. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2090.3s)]
*  There are certain personality types. And I see the worst ones as kind of the, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2091.82s)]
*  we talk about like the dark triad personality traits, which is like, you know, psychopathy and [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2096.94s)]
*  Machiavellianism and narcissism, et cetera, you know, these kinds. I'm gonna get in a lot of [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2101.5s)]
*  trouble for this. But like, I've been around. So in the, in the normal car world, sports cars and [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2106.38s)]
*  such, I'm gonna get in trouble. I love exotic cars. I really do. Okay. Like when I was a kid, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2112.7000000000003s)]
*  my dad showed me the movies Grand Prix with James Gardner and Le Mans with Steve McQueen. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2118.06s)]
*  Please tell me you've seen at least one of these movies, right? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2122.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2123.9s)]
*  Okay. Well watch Le Mans with Steve McQueen, just getting a good vibe as Steve McQueen being [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2124.7000000000003s)]
*  himself and just Le Mans on straight in Le Mans early seventies, Porsche flat 12 against the [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2128.86s)]
*  Ferrari V12, just singing it and like as a kid, I'm like, I want that. You know what I mean? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2135.58s)]
*  So I love exotic cars because for me, something like a V12 Lamborghini is like, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2140.14s)]
*  yes, I can't be Steve McQueen at Le Mans, but I can drive this. You know what I mean? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2144.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2148.38s)]
*  But nowadays they're paddle shifted and anybody that wants to flex can buy them. So if somebody [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2149.34s)]
*  ever said to me, Hey Casey, I need you to find me the most narcissistic sociopaths possible. I'm [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2155.2599999999998s)]
*  like, no problem. Let's find the most Lamborghinis. And the reason I bring that up- [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2159.42s)]
*  And you say they're paddle shift, meaning the- [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2163.66s)]
*  Anybody can drive them. They don't take any more skill or appreciation for the machinery, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2166.46s)]
*  respectfully. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2170.94s)]
*  How were they, were you like double clutching them? Like how hard were they to operate before? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2171.58s)]
*  Like a- [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2176.3799999999997s)]
*  When there was standard transmission. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2177.1s)]
*  Yeah. Things like that back when, you know, the carbureted, like anything, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2177.98s)]
*  you got to treat a muscle car right a little bit, you know, something that's carbureted. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2181.1s)]
*  Or an old Harley Davidson, like you have to know how to operate it. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2184.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if you get the privilege of driving something like an old Lamborghini or Ferrari from [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2187.3399999999997s)]
*  the seventies or earlier, you gotta be a little sympathetic. You gotta understand the transmission. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2191.98s)]
*  You gotta be able to rev match gears and such. You're not going to be doing wild burnouts and [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2195.7400000000002s)]
*  such. You gotta understand the carburetors and letting it warm up and appreciate it. And we're [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2201.42s)]
*  in industrial age where you don't have to do that. But to answer your question relating to journalism, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2205.18s)]
*  I make that joke about certain things attract certain personality traits because those [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2209.7400000000002s)]
*  personality traits can do well. So, you know, they also say Washington DC is Hollywood for ugly [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2214.46s)]
*  people. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2219.9s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2220.7s)]
*  And I think a lot of the traits of Hollywood to Washington DC to journalism are the same [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2221.34s)]
*  kind of manipulative sociopath tendencies. That you can lie to somebody with a smile perfectly and [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2228.2200000000003s)]
*  find the structured crazy chess game to ruin people's life and power play your way up and [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2234.3s)]
*  find power in money. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2239.9s)]
*  I mean, I think, I mean, everything you're saying is true. But it's just disappointing to see it in [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2240.78s)]
*  journalism, not because crappy people with weird personal lives go to journalism. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2247.26s)]
*  And they're cowards. Of course, most people are, unfortunately, but they have no curiosity. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2252.1400000000003s)]
*  And that's what drives me insane. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2259.1800000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2260.86s)]
*  If there's one quality that defines journalism and a journalist, it's the desire to know more. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2261.34s)]
*  And they spend their whole lives trying to, you know, attack you, call you a racist for [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2268.3s)]
*  wanting to know more. It's insane. So somebody called me, well, actually, you did call me. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2272.2200000000003s)]
*  I built this car that gets 104 gallons. I mean, miles to a gallon. I'm not even a car guy, really. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2277.02s)]
*  But I'm like, well, that's kind of crazy on a diesel motor. Really? Engine? Yes. And, you know, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2282.14s)]
*  I tried to be polite and qualify myself. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2288.2999999999997s)]
*  I was like, it was amazing. I was like, really? Is that really true? I guess you get video of it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2289.98s)]
*  So I guess it is. So I don't know why if I was a professional car viewer, I'd be like, I'm coming [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2294.46s)]
*  to your house. I want to see what this is. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2299.42s)]
*  Yeah. And to be fair in a manner of speaking, I didn't really invent anything. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2301.02s)]
*  I just designed something better and thought about the world independently. And like, I'm [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2304.94s)]
*  doing this. It needs to represent what we actually can do and where we can go. And I just, I have to [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2309.7400000000002s)]
*  do this. Not all sleep aids are made by pharmaceutical companies. You probably heard about 8 Sleep by [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2314.86s)]
*  now. They develop the country's most innovative products for sleep. Almost everybody in our office [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2319.98s)]
*  uses something they make called the pod and they love it. And there's a reason that professional [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2325.5s)]
*  athletes and lots of other smart people do too. You add the pod to your mattress, like a mattress [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2329.34s)]
*  cover, and it helps you get a better night's sleep and fill with vitality at the start of each day [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2334.3s)]
*  in an intimidating way almost. It's amazing. How does it do it? Well, it uses advanced technology [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2338.6200000000003s)]
*  to track your sleep and automatically adjust the temperature of your side of the bed to what's [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2344.3s)]
*  perfect for sleep. And temperature makes all the difference. It's backed by over 600 million hours [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2349.82s)]
*  of data. They've also used those insights to create their new product, Sleep Elixir, to help you get [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2355.5800000000004s)]
*  quiet before you go to bed, fall asleep faster and stay knocked out longer. No grogginess, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2360.54s)]
*  no weird side effects, just better deep sleep. So if you're ready to take sleep and recovery [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2365.82s)]

*  for 30 days if you don't love it. It works. Were you obsessed? I don't think obsessed. No, but I mean, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2377.66s)]
*  did it, was it the kind of thing that occupied your thoughts in bed and like, were you really fixated [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2384.7s)]
*  on it? I mean, yeah, because I designed the things in my head. I'll do like a drawing or an [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2389.42s)]
*  engineering drawing or something just to communicate and show somebody else, but I'll run all the [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2395.26s)]
*  simulations and design the entire structure and everything in my head. My wife gets on my case [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2398.62s)]
*  sometimes. We go on a date or she's like, I can see the hamster wheel turning. I'm like, I'm sorry. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2403.7400000000002s)]
*  That's how creativity works. It just germinates in your head. No, I've lived with it. But no, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2407.66s)]
*  the journos, I appreciate you saying that because they follow along. They want their power within [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2413.1s)]
*  their bubble. But the thing that's kind of crazy to me when I say they're gutless, you would think [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2417.66s)]
*  they would actually get better views and more clicks if they broke the mold to show something [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2421.8199999999997s)]
*  interesting that maybe goes against popular narratives, but they don't. Oh, they spend their [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2425.8199999999997s)]
*  lives dutifully ignoring things. I mean, there are megaliths around the world, including in the United [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2431.42s)]
*  States, huge stone structures and nobody, including any structural engineer in the United States, has [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2436.22s)]
*  no idea how they were built in the pre-internal combustion age, in the pre-industrial age. There's [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2442.7s)]
*  literally not even a good guess as to how this was built. Of course, I don't know the answer either, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2449.8999999999996s)]
*  but that's such an amazing thing. When were the pyramids built? Nobody knows. How were they built? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2454.54s)]
*  Nobody knows. I can't get that out of my head. And again, I'm not pushing a conspiracy theory. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2459.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm just noting what we don't know. And I don't know why everyone's like, shut up. Shut up. What? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2464.2999999999997s)]
*  Now, I'm glad you said that. And there's a lot of other structures that are popping up more [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2472.46s)]
*  nowadays in archeology. And there's even guys that do like surface lidar, and they're seeing things [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2476.46s)]
*  in fields and such. And as silly as it is- Can you explain what that is for people who don't know [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2481.34s)]
*  what you're talking about? To be perfectly honest, I don't know it as well. But I think through the [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2484.78s)]
*  satellites and stuff that we can use now, like nerds, and I mean that in a nice way, spend the [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2488.1400000000003s)]
*  time looking over, it shows the exact topography of the ground. Exactly. Without vegetation. And [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2492.6200000000003s)]
*  suggest what's underneath it. Yeah. So if you start seeing geometric shapes and stuff, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2499.18s)]
*  might be something. It might be manmade, or at least made. Yeah. And the other thing is, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2502.7799999999997s)]
*  so maybe not too long ago, 10, 20, 30 years ago, we think, oh, we've discovered everything. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2508.14s)]
*  We're brilliant. We know everything. It's just the opposite of the truth. It's not true. I know. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2512.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know if I'll have time or what the future will bring, but I really want to do some videos [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2518.3799999999997s)]
*  where you go to interesting places in the world to see and find these things. And one thing I'd [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2524.06s)]
*  really like to do is motorcycles around Saudi Arabia. Yeah. Because it is a fascinating kingdom [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2530.06s)]
*  with some really interesting history. I was just there. Well, yeah. Yes. And I was out in Aula, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2534.94s)]
*  which is a truly ancient- Yes. Right. Yes. That's the place you want to see it. One of them. Right [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2539.98s)]
*  out from Riyadh. It's quite amazing, but the archaeology there, which is, the Saudis have a [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2545.5s)]
*  lot going on. They're building a whole new society. Yeah. And I don't know that they are [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2550.94s)]
*  focused on, like most emerging nations are not focused on archaeology. All of the archaeological [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2556.06s)]
*  sites of significance in the Middle East and the Near East, the Levant, were discovered by the Brits [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2563.26s)]
*  and the French. Right. All of them. They'd sat there for thousands of years. The locals were like [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2570.38s)]
*  too busy trying to stay alive to notice. Well, they knew of it. I don't want to say normal to [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2574.94s)]
*  them, but that's their home. But it took people from the outside to be like, wait, what the hell [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2578.14s)]
*  is that? Where was whatever? Sodom and Gomorrah? Yes. Yes. Yes. I mean, how much of that is Biblical [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2581.58s)]
*  land, like the land of Midian, which they know. But the point is that process of discovery and [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2587.3399999999997s)]
*  of creativity is driven by a common impulse, which is curiosity. Yeah. And so when you don't [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2593.66s)]
*  have curiosity, you're never going to discover it or create it. But more important, I think, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2600.46s)]
*  for the moment we're living in, it's like, why don't you have curiosity? Why is curiosity [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2608.86s)]
*  discouraged? Like that is a very deep, and I don't know the answer, but I find it scary. There's [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2612.62s)]
*  something sinister about that. Don't ask questions. Well, why? Social media is doing it to us. Yeah, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2617.98s)]
*  but why? What's the... Well... I mean, I don't even have very interesting, crazy views on anything, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2623.18s)]
*  but I know just from talking about World War II, there are people alive who were in World War II. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2629.9s)]
*  It's like it just happened 80 years ago. People denounce you as some Nazi. I couldn't be more [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2634.62s)]
*  against the Nazis, just for the record. But it's like, what was Rudolf Hess doing in Great Britain? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2640.7000000000003s)]
*  That's a really interesting question. No, not a lot. They murdered Rudolf Hess in Spandau [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2646.54s)]
*  in his 80s. I think it's really clear that he was killed. So he wouldn't say why he flew over. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2652.94s)]
*  People just won't talk about things. But it's like, but why? Why is that scary to anybody? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2659.34s)]
*  What are... And the megalith thing and the archaeology thing, why are these scary questions? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2663.9s)]
*  Well... What's the answer? I don't understand. I'll say it. So you said relating to your [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2669.5s)]
*  cars about control, right? Yeah. I don't want this because they can't control it. It's the same thing [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2674.2200000000003s)]
*  of like saying you can pry this, whether it's a sports car or firearm, out of my cold, dead hands. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2678.54s)]
*  If people don't ask questions and they're not interested in their own history or culture [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2683.1800000000003s)]
*  or the past or any others, and they can't relate, it's easier to keep them in one place and your [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2687.02s)]
*  thumb on them. I think that's... I mean, look, but I don't begrudge people a lack of interest [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2693.02s)]
*  in anything. I mean, every person makes his own decisions about what he cares about and [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2698.06s)]
*  his beliefs, his religion, all those things. I'm like very, I guess, liberal in that sense. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2702.86s)]
*  I'm worried when people attack me for being curious. Yeah, I'm not into that myself. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2708.94s)]
*  All these people on this so-called right, whatever, a lot of which is totally fake, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2713.26s)]
*  there's nothing right about it, they're leftists, or they're obeying the same masters, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2717.98s)]
*  start attacking you for asking, oh, just asking questions. It's like, yeah, I am just asking [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2724.5400000000004s)]
*  questions. That's okay. In fact, that's like the core of Western civilization. That's what Martin [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2728.2200000000003s)]
*  Luther did. And the thing that frankly is so dangerous about... No, it's perfect. And frankly, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2734.0600000000004s)]
*  that's what I think is so dangerous about AI. The journey, the life journey to find the wisdom, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2739.9s)]
*  to learn, to seek the truth. Will that stop it? And then who's controlling it? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2744.86s)]
*  Well, the iPhone has not made us better informed. The internet has not made us better informed. In [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2749.34s)]
*  fact, it's centralized control over information. In effect, Wikipedia is the first search result [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2754.3s)]
*  and Wikipedia is completely controlled by the U.S. government, by the intel agencies. Fact. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2763.34s)]
*  And the results in Wikipedia are shaped subtly, sometimes not so subtly, to produce a worldview [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2767.5s)]
*  that is inherently dishonest. It's not true. And if you get your history through Wikipedia, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2775.1s)]
*  I look at Wikipedia every day. There are certain great things about Wikipedia, but big picture, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2780.1400000000003s)]
*  you're going to have no idea what happened in the past if all you do is read Wikipedia. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2785.42s)]
*  No, how can you? I mean, we can think of so many popular things through history that are just that [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2789.7400000000002s)]
*  way where people only know one superficial level. Are you kidding me? No, it has. It has made [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2793.66s)]
*  everything more extreme and pigeonholed everything. You know, it's a dumber like people don't read [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2799.98s)]
*  books. Well, here's something I noticed. Sorry, now I'm really good. Oh, no, you're right. Well, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2804.3799999999997s)]
*  just from doing automotive YouTube, it still works the same as every other YouTube interaction, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2809.8199999999997s)]
*  all that. I it's kind of a funny way to put it. So I was a car guy before YouTube, right? I built [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2814.54s)]
*  cars. I did all that sort of thing. A lot of people that become more prominent in the automotive [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2821.82s)]
*  region of YouTube, they weren't as big a car guy. They kind of just rose up as an interesting [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2825.82s)]
*  character and they're happy to be somewhat famous, make some money, do their thing, get [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2829.7400000000002s)]
*  acknowledgement. And as I grew that, which is funny because the entirety of the reason I went [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2834.38s)]
*  on YouTube was just to try to get some exposure for the nonprofit I was doing because I couldn't [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2840.3s)]
*  get any with traditional media. I was kind of pissed off. So I ended up there for that reason, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2844.6200000000003s)]
*  but kept it going because it's like, okay, well, I have something of a voice. This is good [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2850.3s)]
*  for the nonprofit to give it exposure or just try to have a life and go somewhere. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2854.3s)]
*  But what I noticed is they call the people that are creating the content, the influencers, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2858.86s)]
*  they're the influenced because they're always chasing an algorithm and the algorithm wants to [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2865.5s)]
*  keep you in one place. It doesn't let you evolve. It doesn't let you do anything. No, no, it's [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2869.26s)]
*  totally right. It's a pseudo reality. And I see how that affects the culture in young people. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2873.34s)]
*  I don't like it. No, it's a snake in the ant's tail for sure. I wonder though, like, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2878.62s)]
*  I'm sure this has occurred to you and I'm terrible at business, so don't take my advice, but like, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2885.2599999999998s)]
*  since you have designed something that has inherent utility and obvious mass appeal, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2890.7s)]
*  and I'm naive enough to think that still matters. Like if you make a great thing, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2897.42s)]
*  people want it and they'll pay for it, especially if it's cheap. Why not just do like a crowdfunding [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2901.74s)]
*  situation where like, all right, you know, I designed this vehicle, it's 104 miles to the gallon [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2907.34s)]
*  on diesel fuel, which you can buy anywhere. And that, you know, can match an electric vehicle [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2912.6200000000003s)]
*  off the line. Like who wants to send in money and let's make this thing? Right. Well, it's how you [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2919.02s)]
*  scale it. Right. So in my thinking, if you do a crowdfunding type of thing, it's very grassroots, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2923.82s)]
*  respectively. Yeah. And I would have to go a different direction with the car where they'd [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2928.46s)]
*  kind of almost be like self-assembled prototype type things. And that's cool. But honestly, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2933.1s)]
*  the thing I kind of worry about doing that, starting a small scale versus something else, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2937.66s)]
*  is that I don't want to do something in a sense too good to where they try to change the laws [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2942.38s)]
*  and ruin the ability for people to build their own cars. I know that sounds a little kooky, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2949.66s)]
*  but the other thing is if you think of like private equity guys and such, typically they want a [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2953.5s)]
*  faster return on such. And the problem is when you're thinking of something that, frankly, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2958.7s)]
*  upsets an industry and relates to the automotive industry, how do you integrate it? Can you use [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2962.54s)]
*  the processes to make smaller parts that can be profitable in industry? Do you start smaller like [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2967.5s)]
*  that? Do you want to do all big scale and create a car company from the ground up? Because that's no [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2972.3s)]
*  small task, monetarily speaking. No, it's not. And there's only so many idealistic rogue billionaires [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2976.86s)]
*  in the world, you know, and that's generally what it takes unless you have a government that [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2982.86s)]
*  wants to make something happen. If you can make a vehicle like this for 20 grand, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2987.1s)]
*  why not just sell it for 50 grand on the internet? I'd buy one. You have a point, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2991.98s)]
*  but you got to scale that to a point that works because there's a big difference between doing [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2996.38s)]
*  something in a small manufacturing to mass production. But at the same time, there's got [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=2999.82s)]
*  to be a way to get it out there. I mean, well, Elon's first car with Tesla, the Roadster was a [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3004.62s)]
*  Lotus Elise chassis with a different body and electrified. And the guys that I knew who had [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3010.06s)]
*  those originally were rich guys. They had Ferraris and Lamborghinis and that was their cool toy to [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3015.02s)]
*  start with. What's this car called, by the way? The Tesla Rose, your original one. Oh, mine, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3019.1s)]
*  the Omega car. I called it the Omega car. Yeah. I'd like an Omega car in forest green. Could you do [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3024.06s)]
*  that? Oh, yeah. Actually? Yeah, why not? I'd buy it in a second. Can you ship them? You can. You [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3030.22s)]
*  can. We'd have to talk if you want to prototype something, though. Maybe we'll make something [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3037.98s)]
*  special. Yeah. Hold your fly rods. Yeah, for real. If you can't use it, what good is it? You know, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3041.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm getting one. So I just want to go back to something you said in the very first moments [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3046.94s)]
*  of this interview. You said that you don't own any of it. You're obviously a car guy. You build [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3053.58s)]
*  cars. My happiness is way too wrapped up in the ability to just drive my own car. Yeah, I love, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3059.1s)]
*  but you're there anybody's around or not. I don't care. I just just let me drive my own car. But [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3065.58s)]
*  you like wrenched on him too. Yeah, it's rewarding. I don't want to say you want to do it all the time. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3068.94s)]
*  No, no. I try to. My hands have healed up enough. I won't bleed on my white shirt today. That's nice. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3073.18s)]
*  But can I ask like you said that you don't have any vehicle older than early 2000s? Newer, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3080.8599999999997s)]
*  newer than early rather. Yeah, newer. I beg your pardon. So why is that? Like what's bad about [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3087.3399999999997s)]
*  cars made in the last 25 years? And please be very specific. Oh, I will. The first problem with new [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3094.62s)]
*  cars is you lose money hand over fist to depreciation. And then if you have to take out [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3100.3s)]
*  a loan for it, you're also paying interest on that. And one of the fastest ways I see [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3104.2200000000003s)]
*  normal people in general lose money is on new cars. And they do it because they're afraid they [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3109.02s)]
*  can't work on it or service. That's exactly. That's basically the only real. Exactly right. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3113.6600000000003s)]
*  But then you get dealerships that just find new ways to not do their warranty work because that's [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3118.78s)]
*  where they make a lot of money. And that's, that's a separate thing. So a new car, I mean, that's nice [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3123.26s)]
*  if you can afford it, but rather than buying a new hundred thousand dollar truck or SUV, I'd rather [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3128.22s)]
*  buy this nice used one for, I don't know, 15 or 20 and spend the rest of the money. I'll go, you [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3133.58s)]
*  know, if you got it, go buy a vintage Ferrari or a muscle car, something cool, you know, at least [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3137.5s)]
*  keep your money, have some fun. But it's more than that. Cars, I would say in the last 20 to 25 years, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3141.1s)]
*  the evolution is not for the sake of the car and the person and so much of the experience. It's [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3149.98s)]
*  more for the sake of the nature of dealing with regulation and keeping a profit margin and building [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3155.9s)]
*  it. And when you do that, you make things that are inherently more prone to failing in the future [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3161.7400000000002s)]
*  and less serviceable. And that's not good for ownership or actual lifespan. So everything, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3169.26s)]
*  I mean, I grew up working on a motorcycle with a carburetor and building the carburetor, adjusting [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3176.46s)]
*  the flow bowl, you know, I had a timing light, adjust the points. I mean, all that stuff, just [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3181.74s)]
*  like really super basic mechanics. And, you know, there are lots of downsides to that. They break a [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3186.3799999999997s)]
*  lot, but you could understand it. My feeling is the vehicles that I have had that are newer, I mean, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3190.9399999999996s)]
*  I have no idea how they work. I don't feel injection is still kind of a mystery to me. I'm sorry to say [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3197.4199999999996s)]
*  that it is. It works the same way as a carburetor. It's just metered and more complicated. Well, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3202.8599999999997s)]
*  I guess this trend toward making everything electric. I bought a truck last year, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3208.06s)]
*  a Chevy truck, which I always had. And I was at a gas station and all of a sudden on the dashboard, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3215.34s)]
*  it says stop or downloading information from the internet. While you were driving? No, I was, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3220.94s)]
*  I was stopped. It just specifically wanted you to stay stopped so it can. So it could, I don't know, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3226.78s)]
*  download software. I sold the car immediately. I brought it back and sold it. They wanted all [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3232.3s)]
*  your data to provide to insurance companies to wreck your life. I'm sure. Is that true? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3235.26s)]
*  Okay. Insurance companies will be the downfall of cars and driving. I guarantee it. And the other [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3239.98s)]
*  thing is all the cameras that are out there, everybody's putting cameras on their car. I'm [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3245.42s)]
*  like, okay, you guys. Cameras on their car? Well, I'm sure you've seen it. Like people are buying [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3248.3s)]
*  little cameras to see what happens if somebody does something stupid on the road. You can use [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3252.78s)]
*  that to protect yourself legally, right? That's why they sell it. It's never occurred to me, but yes. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3257.42s)]
*  Okay. What happens when those are mandated in every car everywhere? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3261.9s)]
*  What happens when you're completely mandated control? Car shuts off at exactly 55 mile [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3265.1s)]
*  more speed limit, no matter what. It's just another method of slippery slope of control [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3270.06s)]
*  and it'll come from insurance companies. And the law enforcement can turn off your car from afar, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3275.02s)]
*  correct? Yeah. And they do. Well, with certain cars. Yeah. So what's the, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3279.6600000000003s)]
*  when's the last year you could have a car that can't be controlled? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3285.42s)]
*  That's a good question because I don't mess around with those cars very often. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3289.5s)]
*  Or ever. Is it fair to say- Ones that are connected to the internet or a satellite in some way. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3293.1s)]
*  OnStar kind of came about with your mirror and I don't really know much about it, but that was [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3298.7799999999997s)]
*  kind of the first, I think mainstream way when we saw cars were being specifically connected to [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3302.54s)]
*  something beyond yourself. So would you say pre-911 cars are safe or not? They're a lot safer in terms [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3306.7s)]
*  of that. The other thing too, in the early 2000s, the system called hand bus system came out. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3313.66s)]
*  Hand bus. It was to make wiring more efficient. You theoretically have less wires, but everything [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3318.62s)]
*  is tied together through almost like a spinal cord of the computer and it has to speak to each [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3323.66s)]
*  other. And that was something else. There's kind of a beginning of the end and being serviceable [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3327.9s)]
*  in the future and not creating cars with a lot of glitches. It does feel like everything is, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3331.58s)]
*  you're going to have fly by wire cars. We already do. The other thing is a couple of small points [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3338.62s)]
*  that are also happening were the right to repair your own private properties under attack. That's [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3345.58s)]
*  for farmers. What does that mean? Well, I think there was a big thing going on with John Deere [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3351.02s)]
*  tractors where farmers couldn't service their vehicles. They have to take them to the dealership [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3354.94s)]
*  and have to plug in with the computer that only the dealership has through the company. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3359.66s)]
*  And forgive me if I got this wrong. I think it was John Deere, but that's something that's [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3363.9s)]
*  happening everywhere because if manufacturers or dealerships want more money, well, they want [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3367.82s)]
*  you to service with them. If they make it so you can only service with them no matter what, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3372.2200000000003s)]
*  well, then they're going to in an authoritarian way, force you to let them make the money, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3377.1800000000003s)]
*  which is frankly another method of control. And when you start adding all of those things up, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3383.02s)]
*  you just keep taking away all the power for the people before eventually you get to a point where [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3387.82s)]
*  will you even be able to own your own car anymore? And will you driving it be a liability to where [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3392.62s)]
*  if we have self-driving cars, it just takes you there at the most efficient time that whatever [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3398.46s)]
*  the it wants you to, wants you to. So that's like an attack on human autonomy. Yeah, it's where [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3403.8199999999997s)]
*  that's going. So I had a Harley Davidson, you know, since I was in college in 1971, which, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3411.3399999999997s)]
*  you know, I could kind of understand. Great bike. But I bought a new Harley last year [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3417.42s)]
*  and they delivered it, you know, big fun bike fast, you know, like six speeds, which is actually [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3423.5s)]
*  comfortable crazy to me. And that just the transmission is like, I mean, my bike, you down [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3430.3s)]
*  shift, you got to pop the throttle, no return spring in the throttle, you got to pop that to [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3435.82s)]
*  get it down. And so the shifting in this thing was just like beyond belief. But when they delivered [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3439.7400000000002s)]
*  it to my barn, they said, I said, let's talk about how to change the oil, obviously. And they go, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3446.46s)]
*  no, no, we don't. We actually recommend bringing it to the dealership. And I was like, yeah, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3454.14s)]
*  but it's changed the oil and motorcycles like not hard. And they're like, well, you know, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3459.7400000000002s)]
*  they're gaskets and gaskets. Why would you have to be a gap? Why did you have to replace a gasket [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3464.86s)]
*  to change the oil? Anyway, I brought it back to the dealership. Didn't want it. Oh, really? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3469.7400000000002s)]
*  You're like, and now I'm done with you guys. I did. They were great. I don't mean to attack [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3473.42s)]
*  them in any way. They were awesome people. Most motorcycle people are great people. And they [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3477.58s)]
*  definitely were. But I didn't want a motorcycle where you had to replace a gasket. I mean, like, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3481.82s)]
*  pop the jugs off. Okay, but maybe like a little like copper o-ring or aluminum ring or something [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3488.38s)]
*  on the drain plug. But like, of course, you always is this one of those crazy modern manufacturing [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3494.46s)]
*  thing where you have to do the engine. And they're like, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3498.54s)]
*  I was like, I'm not rebuilding the lower end. Change the oil. And they're like, you know, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3502.86s)]
*  most of our customers bring that back to the dealership. And I was in. I don't know, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3508.6200000000003s)]
*  I didn't like that at all. And I felt like there was a scam involved. Yeah, which is the one you [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3513.6600000000003s)]
*  described, right? Yeah, it just triggers something kind of in your because you're dependent on [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3518.46s)]
*  something wrong here. Yeah. Well, and I don't say those things in a like kooky conspiracy [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3522.78s)]
*  conspiratorial type of way. But it's literally where we're going. And you know, when I see things [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3529.9s)]
*  like that, and I mentioned about it'll be insurance companies that ruin it for everybody. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3534.3s)]
*  Because the other thing is, what happens when they start making it where you can't drive your [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3538.3s)]
*  older cars anymore? Do you ever feel like you can't trust the things you hear or read, like every [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3542.46s)]
*  news source is hollow, distorted, or clearly just propaganda lying to you? Well, you're not imagining [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3547.1800000000003s)]
*  it. If the last few years have proven anything, it's that legacy media exists to distort the truth [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3553.82s)]
*  and to control you to gatekeep information from the public, instead of letting you know what's [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3560.78s)]
*  actually going on. They don't want you to know. But there is, however, a publication that fights [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3564.86s)]
*  this, that is not propaganda, one that we read every month and have for many years is called [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3570.06s)]
*  in Primus. It's from Hillsdale College in Michigan. And Primus is a free speech digest that features [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3574.94s)]
*  some of the best minds in the country addressing the questions that actually matter, the ones that [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3580.38s)]
*  are not addressed in the Washington Post or NBC News. The best part of it, it is free, no cost [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3585.1s)]
*  whatsoever, no strings attached. They just send it to you. Hillsdale will send in Primus right to [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3590.54s)]
*  your house, no charge. All you got to do is ask. Go to tuckerforhillsdale.com and subscribe for free [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3594.62s)]
*  today. That's tuckerforhillsdale.com. The only way this stays a democracy is if the citizenry is [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3601.34s)]
*  informed. You can't fight tyranny if you don't know what's going on. In Primus helps. It's free. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3609.18s)]
*  Don't wait. Sign up now. So I always felt that cash for clunkers, do you remember that program? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3614.62s)]
*  Yes, that was a little early before I started paying attention to the gold zone. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3619.2599999999998s)]
*  So the federal government basically paid clunkers, like perfectly fine cars built before a certain [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3622.62s)]
*  date, you could redeem them for cash. And then they just, they melted them. And I felt like there [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3628.7s)]
*  was something pretty sinister about that. But maybe I'm just like one of those paranoid wackos who- [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3634.46s)]
*  Don't think Randy Weaver deserved to be killed. I don't know. Maybe I'm just on the fringe. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3639.02s)]
*  If an industry- Far right. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3643.02s)]
*  No, if an industry is no longer about innovation, and it's so big that it can't fail and it's [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3644.38s)]
*  pushed to go a certain way, well, then the best way to ensure that it succeeds is force you to [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3650.1400000000003s)]
*  buy something new, even if it's not in your own best interest. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3655.82s)]
*  Exactly. But it does, you know, you raised the question, which is how do you service [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3657.98s)]
*  vehicles made before 9-11? And that is why people don't want them. And I must say, made before. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3665.6600000000003s)]
*  The ones made before are easier to service than the ones made after. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3671.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, it's like if you buy an older vehicle, and I drive an older vehicle, so I know, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3676.06s)]
*  it's like you can't just, I mean, you have to know someone who can fix it. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3681.34s)]
*  Yeah, of course, to an extent. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3685.02s)]
*  Yeah. But are we entering a world where there won't be any mechanics who can, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3686.38s)]
*  who know what a carburetor is, for example? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3691.1s)]
*  I don't know about that so much. It's specialized, but they're simple. You can look at it and know [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3693.66s)]
*  the basic principles that are going on. It's the newer stuff that's crazy. For instance, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3697.8999999999996s)]
*  my father-in-law recently got my mother-in-law this nice newer SUV. I think it's a BMW. I think [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3702.06s)]
*  it's a hybrid SUV. She likes it. And my father-in-law looked at it and go by over like, there's a lot of [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3707.5s)]
*  servos and things worrying and buzzing. And I don't want to say it, but because I'm saying it now, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3712.62s)]
*  it's kind of like, when is this thing going to break? And how much is that going to cost? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3717.2599999999998s)]
*  No, you're not going to reasonably fix that. And then when that thing is older, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3720.7s)]
*  that all these highly specialized little mechanisms and circuit boards and servos or whatever [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3724.7s)]
*  go bad, who's making that? And is it worth making it anymore? Or is it just another giant, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3729.2599999999998s)]
*  complicated, toxic, wasteful thing that we go on in this vicious consumer cycle? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3735.1s)]
*  No, they just crush it. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3740.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, some older cars, you can still fix. This goofy story maybe, but I bought a, for $8,000, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3742.9399999999996s)]
*  I bought a 1996 Rolls Royce off Facebook marketplace, kind of as a joke. I'm like, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3750.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know, this might be kind of cool. I love the car. And I ended up fixing it up for [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3755.42s)]
*  almost nothing. And I got a car that in 1996- Did it run? Yeah. It's a great car. Taking off family [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3760.38s)]
*  trips and all in it. I didn't have to do that much. And a Rolls Royce? Yeah. It was like $170,000, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3766.38s)]
*  $80,000 in the 90s. But where I'm going with it is- The way you roll. Hey, look, I may not be wealthy, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3770.54s)]
*  but I can live well if you got a toolbox and some know-how and you think for yourself. But [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3776.7s)]
*  where I was going with it is that car is fixable. The way it's constructed- What kind of engine [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3780.7799999999997s)]
*  does it have? It's got a V8. It's all aluminum, naturally aspirated V8. The transmission's general [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3785.1s)]
*  motor's based. So when I needed stuff to fix it, I just got it locally. It was no big deal. And sure, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3789.1s)]
*  there's some things that are old Rolls Royce on it, but it's built differently. It's built to where [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3794.06s)]
*  you can actually repair the part. Not just be a parts changing type of mechanic like modern things. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3798.7s)]
*  And people get into technology for technology sake nowadays, but it's the philosophy of design [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3807.2599999999998s)]
*  that goes behind it. We're locked in this consumer industrialized, only new is better, more complicated, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3813.66s)]
*  more expensive, more regulated. When the mentality and the know-how, should we say, of the first half [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3820.14s)]
*  of the 20th century, we built things that could actually be repaired. We built things that can be [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3826.06s)]
*  serviceable, that can last to an extent. So why are we not still using good design and engineering [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3830.86s)]
*  mindsets and direction with modernity in a way that's actually useful for people and communities [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3838.94s)]
*  and nation, and rather than just an industry? I'm most struck by- I mean, because we've [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3846.94s)]
*  deindustrialized is part of it. So that makes sense to me. Why can't we build this or that thing? Why [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3853.6600000000003s)]
*  haven't we been to the moon in 50 years? Assuming we went in the first place. I kind of get that [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3860.54s)]
*  because there are fewer competent engineers. Everyone's a marketing major. Okay, that makes [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3867.42s)]
*  sense. What I don't understand is the decline in design, and not just in automotive, but across [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3872.62s)]
*  this society, the civilization actually. We're making things ugly, aren't we? Why is that? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3881.1s)]
*  That's a cultural issue. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3885.98s)]
*  I was in another city, I won't name it, but a nice kind of tertiary city, but a growing city with a lot of [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3888.94s)]
*  nice people in it, affluent. And I was driving through- this was last week, and I was driving [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3896.86s)]
*  through an affluent neighborhood with one of my children who's a design person, and I said, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3900.62s)]
*  that house is black. This is a new build. It's a brand new house. And they painted it black. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3905.9s)]
*  Normally, that would have meant in Europe, you got the black pill, like, don't come here. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3910.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3914.3s)]
*  Back in the day, right? Like, if you're in Amsterdam. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3914.78s)]
*  A black house? Like, what? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3916.38s)]
*  Amsterdam. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3918.3s)]
*  And then I saw another. And then I saw like three more. I said to my daughter, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3918.78s)]
*  what is this? She goes, it's disgusting. And I felt that way, but like, why would you ever [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3922.46s)]
*  paint a house black? Or why would you build- like, what the hell is going on with design? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3929.7400000000002s)]
*  What's your theory? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3934.2200000000003s)]
*  Actually, I went in college in North Ohio State, third generation there, and originally I was [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3935.58s)]
*  going in for automotive design or product design. I really should have gone into engineering. That's [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3941.82s)]
*  my forte. But where I'm going with this is it's housed within fine art in colleges. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3947.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3952.3s)]
*  And I generally dislike modern art. Okay? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3953.42s)]
*  You think? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3957.1000000000004s)]
*  I think that if you don't have the technical skill to do something actually beautiful, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3958.06s)]
*  then I don't care about your hoo-hoo abstract ideas, right? But where I'm going with this is, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3963.6600000000003s)]
*  so-called art and design and product design has been influenced over the 20th century, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3971.9s)]
*  going back to like the Frankfurt School in Europe, which frankly was a lot of [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3976.86s)]
*  communist mindset that infiltrated the art world. And it's made- [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3982.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, sure. It's anti-Western civilization. It's anti-Christian. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3986.54s)]
*  It's anti-beauty. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3989.5s)]
*  So that's the point. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3990.3s)]
*  Of course. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3990.78s)]
*  It's the simplest thing. In fact, I gave you this small detail. I ended up hating my experience [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3991.1000000000004s)]
*  there. I ended up quitting after like a year and a half and designing my own major just to get the [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3996.2200000000003s)]
*  hell out of school because I was kind of pissed off actually because there was one specifically, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=3999.9s)]
*  I remember in this one class, we get to design something for the whole semester, right? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4005.6600000000003s)]
*  And we're going to design a bathroom scale. I'm like, okay. I thought about it. I'm like, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4009.26s)]
*  this sucks. With the way they're teaching us to have an aesthetic, do the simplest thing possible, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4014.14s)]
*  which is somewhat communistic in a way, you know, it seems almost so- [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4019.34s)]
*  That's the imperative, make it as simple as possible. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4023.9s)]
*  The simplest, most boring thing possible. I'm like, what is the point? Let's just have a white room [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4025.98s)]
*  with one wassily chair in the back of it. We'll just sit there and hate our lives. Like anything [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4029.58s)]
*  beautiful, anything classic, they shied away from design, literally pushed away. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4033.9s)]
*  What about natural? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4039.98s)]
*  Natural beauty? That's not their thing. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4041.5s)]
*  It does seem like there's a very intense, like almost visceral hatred of nature coming off [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4043.98s)]
*  design people. It's like- [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4050.38s)]
*  Strangely, yes. Strangely. But in regard to the story I have to tell you. So the bathroom [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4051.66s)]
*  scale, I thought to myself, this is going to take a semester. It doesn't even have to function. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4057.74s)]
*  And if they just want to make the simplest thing possible, okay, here, here's a round [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4062.06s)]
*  piece of glass with an LCD display on it that tells you to go eat a salad. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4065.1s)]
*  Like, I don't want to do this. And so I met with the academic advisor and I said, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4069.1s)]
*  I will meet all of your academic requirements for this class, but please let me design something [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4074.06s)]
*  at my level right now. Let me design a car. And they said, no, they would not let me design anything. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4078.4599999999996s)]
*  Just because there's too much initiative and too much creativity. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4084.9399999999996s)]
*  They wouldn't let me do it. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4087.7400000000002s)]
*  Did you pay for this experience? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4088.54s)]
*  Yeah, sadly. And that's a problem with the American educational system. You know, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4090.06s)]
*  libraries are free. Yeah. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4093.02s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of nice people out there that can help you learn. But so [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4096.54s)]
*  I stayed around in that program for another semester. I didn't do anything the whole semester. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4100.860000000001s)]
*  The night before the exam and presentation, I just Ferris Bueller'd a bunch of stuff together [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4105.18s)]
*  and ran around. I don't know, got a B plus. And I just designed cars on things on my own. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4109.26s)]
*  But how insane is that, that in college, when you're actually paying to be there, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4114.22s)]
*  and they're supposed to be design and product design, that they won't actually let students [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4117.9s)]
*  do what they're capable of doing or push a boundary or go anywhere. They literally keep [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4123.42s)]
*  a thumb on you like that. I quit the program after that. And I stopped caring where, fortunately, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4127.5s)]
*  when I was in high school, and hopefully people have teachers that actually care, that matter. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4134.38s)]
*  I had art teachers that made the world of difference for me and a lot of other people. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4139.82s)]
*  That was huge. And people write things off now in, you know, pre-college things like shop, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4144.62s)]
*  home ec, vocational art, engineering, drawing. Those are some of the most important things you [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4151.5s)]
*  can possibly have. But we got rid of all of those things to push college prep. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4157.66s)]
*  Way more than, I don't know, third wave feminist literature. I don't know. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4161.66s)]
*  Rethink what you just said and ask yourself, do I really mean? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4165.82s)]
*  Do I mean? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4168.86s)]
*  What I said. Well, that, I don't know, that architectural draftsmanship is more important [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4169.74s)]
*  than, say, The Color Purple by Alice Walker. You mean the things that actually make you [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4175.179999999999s)]
*  contributing, functioning individual members of society? That elevate beauty and truth over like [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4179.58s)]
*  garbage by some low IQ unhappy chick? Yeah. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4185.099999999999s)]
*  That go into an academic vacuum that's not the real world that's fueled by loans you can't default on? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4187.58s)]
*  Whether there's going to be a job for you or not? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4194.139999999999s)]
*  You know, I would say beneath your car design exterior lies a fairly incisive and bitter critique [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4195.9s)]
*  of the society. I think and look around. I don't like liars. I don't like being lied to. And that [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4205.5s)]
*  goes culturally too. I don't either. I completely agree. So how, I just have to be clear on this. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4211.74s)]
*  How if there are other eccentric people out there who would like one of these vehicles [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4219.02s)]
*  that you've designed, how would they, would you be willing to make them to order? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4225.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I could, I could do that. You have to think about the structure of who wants to do what. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4231.02s)]
*  You know, early adopters are usually people that can afford something. It's going to cost more than [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4235.02s)]
*  20 grand when you're building something, but certainly that can be done. I could make lower [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4238.540000000001s)]
*  production numbers and you could build something and a bit of a movement too from the ground up. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4242.46s)]
*  Will it be cool to build it with a gas tank sufficient to get coast to coast? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4247.58s)]
*  It's very doable. And the other thing is, I like to do amateur race driving and vintage racing. So [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4252.94s)]
*  I like to make cars that are fast. And for me, it's kind of fun the idea to make things [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4258.7s)]
*  that get over a hundred miles a gallon that beat Dodge Vipers and Corvettes and Teslas. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4262.54s)]
*  You know, that's what we did back with muscle cars. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4267.58s)]
*  So how do people find you if like, if you made it this far in the interview? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4269.42s)]
*  I'm shockingly easy to find. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4273.0199999999995s)]
*  You are. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4274.3s)]
*  I'm perhaps a little scary. So maybe find a nice method rather than I just look out the window one [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4274.7s)]
*  day and go, so you're not giving your home address. Not at this moment, but are you open to kind of [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4280.139999999999s)]
*  custom build? Of course I'm open to doing things. I mean, you know, I have a nice enough life. I [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4285.74s)]
*  have a wife, I have a cute daughter, a nice neighborhood and neighbors and toys to play with, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4290.78s)]
*  but there's more to life than that. Can you find men to work for you? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4295.66s)]
*  Of course. I've been mentoring college students for the last decade plus. I can call [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4300.7s)]
*  up half of them. They've got great jobs out there. So I guess it gets to a larger question. I mean, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4304.54s)]
*  the trades are not dead, correct? No, they're not dead and they're [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4308.94s)]
*  vastly important right now. More people should be going into them. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4311.82s)]
*  I know. You wouldn't have all the student debt. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4314.06s)]
*  But in your life, if you all of a sudden got an order for 15 of these vehicles, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4316.3s)]
*  could you find the people necessary? Yeah, I could put that together. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4320.7s)]
*  Wow. Okay. Well, even if there's something that I don't know, I'm going to find it. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4323.42s)]
*  Yes. Like you make it happen. But you know, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4328.78s)]
*  one man can't do everything by themselves. If you're building something and nobody wants it, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4331.58s)]
*  that's a problem. You need to build something somebody wants. And if it requires a team of [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4337.18s)]
*  people coming together, whether that's with talents or resources or finances to do it, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4341.9s)]
*  then you find a way. Do you think if you started doing this, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4346.86s)]
*  the government would jump on you? It depends on how you do it. It is a game. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4349.98s)]
*  And to be honest, when I look at the car and what I've done with that or with the education [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4357.0199999999995s)]
*  nonprofit or anything else in life, I look at how do I have the biggest positive impact I [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4361.5s)]
*  possibly can? You know, and right now the biggest impact with regard to the car is talking about it. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4365.02s)]
*  So people do know what's possible. So hopefully maybe they kind of, you know, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4370.06s)]
*  wake up for a second from the cell phone, look around and think that that's that's a vastly [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4375.82s)]
*  important thing to do. So I think it has tremendous value there. But, you know, I want to build [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4380.38s)]
*  something. You know, I'm an America first kind of guy. Like, why in the heck are we not building [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4387.1s)]
*  these things here? Yeah, why? We should. You know, I'll give you an example. I've been around the [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4391.5s)]
*  sun 43 times in my life, right? When I was younger, and we're working the little town golf course, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4396.860000000001s)]
*  that's a family business. And a lot of the guys that golf at our golf course, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4402.620000000001s)]

*  And usually I get ticked off. And then I think and plan and do something. Yeah. Well, there's an [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4433.02s)]

*  Casey, I really appreciate you taking all this time. Amazing. Thank you. I'm going to [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO-sy5ut490&t=4446.54s)]
