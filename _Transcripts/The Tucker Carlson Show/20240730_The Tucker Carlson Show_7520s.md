# Sen. Mike Lee You're Underestimating Kamala Harris and the Media Machine. Here's Why.
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo)
*  So did you read the the Cy Hirsch piece about how Biden was driven out of his job? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I read a summary of it. I have not read the piece itself. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  I just read it this morning. Here's just here. Here's the Cliff Notes. Obama colludes with [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=12.68s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi and Hakeem Jeffries and Schumer and calls Sunday morning calls Biden and says [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=19.46s)]
*  you're done. Kamala is going to 25th Amendment you and you got to step aside. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=26.72s)]
*  And who places the call? Obama. Obama does. So Obama calls the sitting president and tells [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  him you're done. Then tells, I mean, that's what the piece says, tells Kamala Harris, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=38.08s)]
*  okay, you're going to be the nominee. But if you don't gain traction, if you're not [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=45.32s)]
*  popular, we're going to take you out too. So my question to you, I mean, it's all shocking. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=52.6s)]
*  It sounds true. New York Times and Washington Post, by the way, Wall Street Journal have [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=60.36s)]
*  not done any meaningful reporting on this. So this is this is what we know so far. Is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=64.16s)]
*  that legal? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=68.76s)]
*  It certainly presents a lot of legal questions that could be problematic. For example, if [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=82.6s)]
*  in fact, the 25th Amendment is worthy of being invoked, yes, if his condition is such that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=96.52s)]
*  it needs to be invoked, and then they don't invoke it, then they're leaving the country [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=102.52s)]
*  in a precarious position of being led by a man not in possession of his faculties. If [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=106.96s)]
*  on the other hand, it's not worthy of being invoked, then they've used an extortive threat [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=111.34s)]
*  to oust the guy who's at the top of the ticket who's the current incumbent president. And [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  that's not okay. I mean, I'm pretty sure that qualifies in some way as extortion. But if [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=125.06s)]
*  it's not extortion, it's just a very underhanded manipulation of the process. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=133.66s)]
*  But voters don't enter into the calculation at any point. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=138.06s)]
*  No. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=140.9s)]
*  So I know this is like a tired observation at this point. But the same people who've been [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  lecturing us berating us finger wagging for years now about democracy, just kicked the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=146.1s)]
*  president out of the spot without any votes being cast at all, ignoring the votes of Democratic [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=153.74s)]
*  primary voters. Like, I can't imagine a graver attack on democracy than what they just did. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  Right. And it denigrates their own party faithful, the voters who showed up in what was essentially [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=166.22s)]
*  an uncontested primary election. And they've turned that into a sham. Because I'm guessing, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  I can't know for certain, but I'm guessing they've known for some time, just as we've [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=180.42s)]
*  been able to tell for some time, that President Biden has problems. Yes, they didn't do [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=184.42s)]
*  anything about it. All of a sudden, when they decide the timing is right, perhaps because [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=190.02s)]
*  of his debate performance, which I suspect they had a hand in planning, because they [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  knew how it would turn out. At some point, they said, okay, the time is right now. Now [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=201.66000000000003s)]
*  we're going to show the world that he can't handle the job. But I find it difficult to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=206.66000000000003s)]
*  believe that they didn't. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=212.9s)]
*  So you think that it's possible Biden was set up? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=213.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=217.38s)]
*  They knew he was failing. They had to have a kind of pivot point to change the story. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=218.38s)]
*  And that's maybe why all the lackeys, all the bootlickers at CNN instantly pivoted as [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=223.26s)]
*  one from Biden cheerleaders to Biden denigrators. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=229.86s)]
*  Instantaneously. In fact, my wife Sharon, who you've met, she and I were watching the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=233.34s)]
*  debate together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=237.94s)]
*  Charming, cool woman. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=238.54s)]
*  Isn't she though? She is amazing. I don't know how I convinced her to marry me. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=239.74s)]
*  That thought did occur to me. I was impressed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=243.3s)]
*  Well, I just thought I'd put that out there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=245.54s)]
*  No, it's actually true. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=247.94s)]
*  Her immediate reaction when things turned. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=250.22s)]
*  Remember when the CNN panel came on right after the debate ended, she said, this appears [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  orchestrated. This is all choreographed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=259.26s)]
*  It's like they were ready to do this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=261.74s)]
*  This has the feeling of being planned in advance. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=263.58s)]
*  They knew what was going to happen. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=267.42s)]
*  And when else, Tucker, have you seen a presidential debate between two general election [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  opponents occur that early in the year? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=275.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=277.5s)]
*  Before either nominee has had the convention, before either nominee is technically fully [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=278.18s)]
*  the nominee. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=283.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=284.26s)]
*  I can't recall a time when that has happened. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=284.62s)]
*  And so why then? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=288.1s)]
*  It seems awfully curious that the Biden campaign team agreed to that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=289.98s)]
*  And the only rational explanation I can think of was the one that we're alluding to here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=297.18s)]
*  Well, especially because they were telegraphing, sending signals that they might not debate [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump at all because he was at this point a felon or an accused felon. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=306.98s)]
*  I mean, they were leaking this for months. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=310.58s)]
*  You know, it lowers us. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=313.38s)]
*  The sitting president shouldn't have to debate a guy charged with crimes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=315.66s)]
*  They were saying that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=318.5s)]
*  And then in a day, they're just like, oh, yeah, of course, we're going to have this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=320.18s)]
*  debate, you know, really early. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=322.74s)]
*  What is that? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=325.86s)]
*  Yeah, that is an indication. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  I think the most rational explanation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  There are other explanations that one could draw, I think. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=332.06s)]
*  But the most logical explanation to me is that they knew that they couldn't hide his [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=334.46s)]
*  condition much longer. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=340.54s)]
*  The media and the White House staff had done a really good job hiding him, protecting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  him, explaining all sorts of errors, wandering off the wrong end of the stage, shaking [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=347.42s)]
*  hands with people who weren't there, saying weird stuff that was unintelligible. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=353.86s)]
*  But they realized they couldn't keep that contained much longer. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=359.7s)]
*  And so they said, all right, let's agree to a debate. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=363.42s)]
*  And if things don't go as they should. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=366.02s)]
*  Inevitably knowing how things were going to go, then we'll do what we've got to do. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=371.06s)]
*  My very first reaction, one of the first tweets that I sent, I think it was driving my [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=376.74s)]
*  wife nuts because I was live tweeting commentary during the debate, one of my first [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=382.18s)]
*  tweets was, it looks to me like they gave him the wrong shot. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=385.82s)]
*  Because, you know, a lot of times when he comes in to do the State of the Union, he's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=389.74s)]
*  really, really up, sort of like he's just consumed like six Red Bulls at once and amped [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=394.62s)]
*  up and kind of angry. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=402.46s)]
*  He was really low energy from the very outset. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=404.42s)]
*  Anyway, that makes me wonder all kinds of things right down to how they prepared him. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=407.65999999999997s)]
*  It does seem like a perilous moment to me because we've now seen the kidnappers face. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=412.46s)]
*  I mean, they've kind of showed us exactly how things actually work. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  Voters play no role in it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=421.82s)]
*  It's donors and Democratic Party leaders like Obama and Schumer and Jeffries and Pelosi [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=423.18s)]
*  who make all the decisions and they're not even pretending anymore. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=428.74s)]
*  No, not even pretending anymore because look, they have a very different experience in the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=432.7s)]
*  political world than those of us who are Republicans because they've always got this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  media bubble shield around them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=444.18s)]
*  It's like they've got this laser shield and that laser shield doesn't leave them [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=446.5s)]
*  vulnerable to the same sorts of forces that the rest of us have. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=452.18s)]
*  And so they can get away with all sorts of things. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=456.22s)]
*  Tucker, can you imagine the kind of absolute venom that would be released against [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=458.9s)]
*  Republicans if we pulled a stunt like that? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=464.82s)]
*  I can't even begin to imagine how that would take us down, but it's not even touching them [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=467.46s)]
*  because the media choose not to report on it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=473.29999999999995s)]
*  Not even to mention. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=476.46s)]
*  That's totally right because they're of course, they're co-conspirators in it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=477.26s)]
*  What did you think as a senator, prominent senator, for the preceding three and a half [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=480.21999999999997s)]
*  years where, you know, you have to deal with the White House? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=486.46s)]
*  I mean, of course, just our process requires you to deal with the White House. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=488.97999999999996s)]
*  Did you know that Biden was impaired? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=493.9s)]
*  Yes, I could tell just based on things that I saw from a distance. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=497.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=501.65999999999997s)]
*  We lost my mother-in-law a few years ago to Alzheimer's. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=503.18s)]
*  She had had the disease for nearly a decade. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=506.34s)]
*  The doctors told us soon after she was diagnosed, what sorts of things to watch for. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=509.58s)]
*  And they said, you'll know that it's starting to get a lot worse when it starts to affect [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=514.9s)]
*  her posture and particularly her gait. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=519.62s)]
*  When she starts shuffling, kicking her feet forward, rather than walking in a fluid, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=522.98s)]
*  smooth motion like she always has, you'll know that things are progressing quickly and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=527.58s)]
*  that that is an outward manifestation of what's going on inside of her mind. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=533.78s)]
*  I saw that same gait and posture in President Biden during his first term in office. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=538.86s)]
*  I don't remember exactly when it was in 2021 that I noticed that, but it was sometime [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=545.42s)]
*  during his first year. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=549.7s)]
*  Now, obviously, there are other reasons why someone could have that happen for where it [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=551.38s)]
*  wouldn't necessarily be reflective of his cognitive decline. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=556.1s)]
*  But then I saw plenty of reasons to believe there was cognitive decline happening as well. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=560.38s)]
*  Yes, they kept him shielded not only from the public and from non-friendly press, but [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=565.5s)]
*  also from members of Congress. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=573.3000000000001s)]
*  Now, remember, I've been in the Senate for 13 and a half years. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=574.62s)]
*  I've served while we've had three different presidents, you know, Obama, Biden as his [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=578.78s)]
*  vice president, and then, you know, Trump, and now Biden as president. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=586.38s)]
*  We have seen a lot more of other presidents. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=591.22s)]
*  Trump was a lot more gregarious. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=594.54s)]
*  He was a lot more willing and eager to engage with rank and file members in Congress than [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=596.14s)]
*  Obama was. But Obama was still up on the Hill a fair amount. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=601.5s)]
*  I mean, one time in Perthura, I remember walking in the basement of the Capitol. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=604.58s)]
*  I was turning a corner and bumped right into President Obama. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=609.5400000000001s)]
*  And we had a great little chat. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=613.82s)]
*  Oh, Mike, good to see you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=615.34s)]
*  Let's talk soon about general justice reform. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=617.0600000000001s)]
*  It's great. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=619.22s)]
*  We'd run into him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=620.5s)]
*  He would call from time to time just to check in on things that we agreed on, projects that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=621.82s)]
*  we were working on together. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=626.14s)]
*  Trump, of course, was very active. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=629.02s)]
*  Members of Congress could call him and get him on the phone very, very quickly. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=632.22s)]
*  He was very engaging. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=637.18s)]
*  With Biden, it hardly happens at all. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=638.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=641.3s)]
*  They shielded him from us. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=641.7s)]
*  In some ways, my wife, I think this was in maybe the first half or the first quarter [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=644.9s)]
*  of 2022, went over to an event at the White House for Senate spouses hosted by the First [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=653.54s)]
*  Lady, who was herself a longtime member of the Senate Spouses Organization. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=660.22s)]
*  And while they were there, President Biden just kind of came wandering in. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=665.34s)]
*  I think they were in one of the ballrooms. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=670.74s)]
*  Kind of came wandering in. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=673.1s)]
*  She said there was no Secret Service with him, no staff with him. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=674.02s)]
*  He just kind of walked in. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=677.5400000000001s)]
*  She said instinctively, I just said, oh, hello, Mr. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=679.6600000000001s)]
*  President, it's good to see you. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=682.22s)]
*  He asked her, do you work in the East Wing? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=684.7s)]
*  And she said, no, no, Mr. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=688.5s)]
*  President, I'm Sharon, Sharon Lee, Senator Mike Lee's wife. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=689.62s)]
*  He swore me into the Senate twice, first in 2011, then in 2017, just before he left the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=694.58s)]
*  vice presidency. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=700.78s)]
*  And we had interacted with him a lot. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=702.34s)]
*  And she thought that would take care of it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=703.86s)]
*  He looked confused. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=705.7s)]
*  Moments later, he said, do you work in the West Wing? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=706.5s)]
*  And he was not quite there. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=710.98s)]
*  Moments later, moments later, someone came up to him, one of the other Senate [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=713.58s)]
*  spouses, I think it was a Democrat, and had a phone in her hand and said, hey, my [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=719.38s)]
*  brother-in-law is a big fan. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=725.38s)]
*  It's his birthday. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=727.58s)]
*  We would say hi to him. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=729.38s)]
*  This is Biden's signature move. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=731.18s)]
*  This is he's really, really good at this. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=733.34s)]
*  I remember when I first came to the Senate and he would have dinner and other [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=736.46s)]
*  gatherings with senators. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=740.38s)]
*  He got Pat Toomey's dad on the phone when he found out he had lived in Scranton. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=742.14s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, how the hell are you? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=746.26s)]
*  Is it Joe Biden? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=748.34s)]
*  I understand you're from Scranton. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=749.14s)]
*  By the end of it, Pat Toomey's dad and then Vice President Biden felt like [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=750.1s)]
*  they were old fraternity brothers. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=755.26s)]
*  I knew Biden and I remember exactly that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=756.66s)]
*  Very good at this. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=758.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh, excellent. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=759.86s)]
*  This woman handed him the phone. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=760.9s)]
*  It rang. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=763.02s)]
*  The woman's brother-in-law answered hello. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=764.6999999999999s)]
*  And then he got a confused look on his face, held out the phone, hung it up and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=768.54s)]
*  handed the phone back. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=774.22s)]
*  Now that for Joe Biden is very significant. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=776.1800000000001s)]
*  Very significant. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=780.26s)]
*  And this is sitting president of the United States. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=780.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=782.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=782.6600000000001s)]
*  And this was, I believe a year and a half, two perhaps a little more than two years ago. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=783.14s)]
*  So we would see little snippets like this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=788.94s)]
*  That's a big snippet. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=791.9s)]
*  And then we would see the clips on TV, which in some ways were worse. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=793.26s)]
*  I'm still stunned that the media did everything that they could to minimize [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=798.6999999999999s)]
*  the significance of this, but still they were caught on camera. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=807.9799999999999s)]
*  They were out there and they just sort of didn't comment on it as if we didn't [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=810.9399999999999s)]
*  say anything about it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=816.5799999999999s)]
*  It wasn't real. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=817.3s)]
*  That is an amazing story. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=819.3399999999999s)]
*  So that was almost three years ago. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=820.8199999999999s)]
*  You said, I mean, do senators, I mean, there are only a hundred of you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=823.14s)]
*  You all know each other pretty well. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=827.5799999999999s)]
*  I've noticed, um, smallest club in Washington, which is a small city. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=828.8199999999999s)]
*  Do people, do people talk about this? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=833.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=835.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=836.3399999999999s)]
*  Um, Republicans talk about it a lot. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=837.26s)]
*  Of course, when we talk about it with our democratic colleagues, uh, there [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=839.66s)]
*  will sometimes be nods and, uh, statements to the effect that, yeah, well, you know, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=843.14s)]
*  there are good days and bad days. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=849.0999999999999s)]
*  And then they try to move on as soon as possible. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=851.02s)]
*  They don't like to talk about it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=853.62s)]
*  I suppose I understand why they don't want to talk about it, but it's a thing [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=855.26s)]
*  that sometimes needs to be talked about. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=859.1s)]
*  Well, especially since we've got a couple of wars going on that we're paying for. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=861.46s)]
*  I mean, they're very high stakes. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=864.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=866.66s)]
*  This moment. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=867.1s)]
*  And if you don't have someone at the top who is a sentient being who understands [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=868.5s)]
*  what's at stake and can make real time calculations after making an initial [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=874.3s)]
*  decision to say, I don't know, uh, withdraw from Afghanistan, uh, by September [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=879.4599999999999s)]
*  11th of 2021, if in the days and weeks leading up to that, there are all sorts [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=887.38s)]
*  of sort of warning signs that that might not be the best approach, by the way, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=894.3s)]
*  why on earth would you tie the withdrawal to the anniversary of a terrorist [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=900.0999999999999s)]
*  attack against the United States? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=905.6999999999999s)]
*  I think that's really bizarre. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=907.26s)]
*  But there are all sorts of warning signs that making that deadline, uh, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=909.9s)]
*  would itself cause problems. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=916.3399999999999s)]
*  Now I had been supportive for years of the idea of withdrawal. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=917.54s)]
*  So me too was president Trump. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=921.06s)]
*  And when president Trump was still in office, I talked to him about this a fair [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=923.38s)]
*  amount and to his national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, and what they [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=926.5799999999999s)]
*  would tell me is, look, we've got a really good plan to do this. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=929.78s)]
*  We think we can pull this off by maybe the first or second quarter of 2021. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=932.54s)]
*  You know, if he's, uh, reelected, there were some, um, there was some prep work [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=937.8199999999999s)]
*  that had to be done in the lead up to those months, uh, and they weren't able [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=942.42s)]
*  to pull it off in 2020, but their plan involved making sure that there was not [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=947.38s)]
*  a single weapon that could fire, uh, left in the country. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=951.6999999999999s)]
*  Uh, president Trump, I think took it even further. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=955.9s)]
*  He didn't want a single nail or a single screw left intact that any gun that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=957.78s)]
*  couldn't be exported would have to have its barrel melted down or exploded [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=963.38s)]
*  and rendered unusable. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=967.98s)]
*  He wasn't going to leave any weaponry behind that could be usable by the enemy. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=969.6600000000001s)]
*  But with Biden having made this arbitrary decision to withdraw by the anniversary [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=975.26s)]
*  of the nine 11 attacks, he didn't back off. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=981.3000000000001s)]
*  Now, why is that? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=985.0600000000001s)]
*  He's the commander in chief, of course, but once he made that arbitrary decision, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=986.1800000000001s)]
*  if he's not in full possession of his faculties, might that explain why he had [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=989.18s)]
*  this dogged determination to proceed with that, even though there are all kinds [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=994.34s)]
*  of warning signs flashing? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=998.74s)]
*  I mean, given what we saw at the debate and now adding to that, the story you [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=999.98s)]
*  just told about your wife's interactions with him at the White House, where he [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1004.66s)]
*  couldn't even talk on the phone. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, who's running the government? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1010.18s)]
*  That's the, who has been running the government for the last four years. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  Who's running it now? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1014.54s)]
*  He's still president apparently. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1015.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1016.62s)]
*  Why do the bad people have so much power? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1017.18s)]
*  Cause the bad people have all the money. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1019.22s)]
*  Where'd they get all the money? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1021.02s)]
*  You gave it to them by using their businesses, businesses that undermine this [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1021.86s)]
*  country and empower countries that don't seek the best for your family. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1027.06s)]
*  Trust us. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1032.1399999999999s)]
*  But there is an alternative. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1033.26s)]
*  It's called public square. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1034.3s)]
*  Public square is a network of over 75,000 independent businesses, small businesses [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1036.1s)]
*  in this country from which you can buy guns and ammo, fresh food, household goods, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1041.5s)]
*  things you see you need to live. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1047.0600000000002s)]
*  And when you buy them, you can feel certain that you are not doing a bad deed. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1050.0600000000002s)]
*  You are doing a good deed that will make this a better and more independent country [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1053.54s)]
*  and make your kids future brighter. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1058.3400000000001s)]
*  Public square.com. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1060.38s)]
*  We are honored. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1062.1000000000001s)]
*  We are proud to have them as a sponsor of this show. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1062.78s)]
*  Look, what we don't know is how common those were. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1066.3400000000001s)]
*  We see, we saw so little of them. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1069.0600000000002s)]
*  It sees so little of him. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1070.78s)]
*  And it's hard to say whether those were to what degree those were aberrations. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1072.78s)]
*  We all hoped and wanted to believe that maybe just maybe, yeah, sometimes he's got a [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1078.34s)]
*  lot on his mind or he's tired or whatever. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1085.06s)]
*  And everybody has down moments. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1087.5s)]
*  Maybe just maybe there are times when he's lucid and those vastly outnumber those that [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1089.54s)]
*  aren't. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1095.62s)]
*  Now, that seems to be contradicted by everything we saw during that same time period from [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1095.94s)]
*  clips from the public. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1103.6200000000001s)]
*  But then again, he was sometimes giving speeches where he appeared to be sort of in [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1104.5s)]
*  control, not necessarily as sharp as he once was, but aware of his surroundings. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1109.3400000000001s)]
*  Those are all scripted. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1114.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1115.46s)]
*  So we're so I mean, you're the constitutional scholar. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1115.7800000000002s)]
*  So this is a question, not a statement. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1118.5400000000002s)]
*  But my understanding is that under our system, the people rule, that's the fundamental [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1119.8200000000002s)]
*  point, and they rule through their elected representatives. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1124.7s)]
*  And so the people who are elected have all the power because the people have all the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1127.7s)]
*  power. I think that's the way it works. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1131.46s)]
*  Popular sovereignty. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1133.06s)]
*  Yeah. And so if unelected, un-elected officials in, say, the executive branch are making all [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1134.06s)]
*  the meaningful decisions, that's illegal. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1141.98s)]
*  That's unconstitutional, isn't it? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1144.78s)]
*  Yeah, especially considering the fact that the way the Constitution is set up, the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1146.74s)]
*  president of the United States is the executive branch. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1151.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1154.3s)]
*  With the exception of the vice president, who has an independent status and set of [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1155.58s)]
*  responsibilities under the Constitution, but they're fairly narrow. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1163.3799999999999s)]
*  The president of the United States, if we were operating in a manner truly consistent [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1168.54s)]
*  with the structure, text, original understanding of the Constitution, the president of the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1174.74s)]
*  United States would be in charge of the entire executive branch with the ability essentially [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1179.66s)]
*  to fire anyone for any reason or no reason at all. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1184.78s)]
*  And so... [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1191.0600000000002s)]
*  Because the power resides in him. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1192.22s)]
*  Because he's the elected person. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1193.74s)]
*  And so, yeah, it's very constitutionally problematic to have others who are not elected, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1196.8600000000001s)]
*  who are not him, who are performing the executive role, not him. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1201.7s)]
*  Now, there's no way for any of us from the outside that kept him so shielded and so [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1206.5s)]
*  insulated, no way for us to be able to assess to what degree, like how many hours out of [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1210.46s)]
*  an average day he was on his A game. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1217.26s)]
*  He was really lucid. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1221.8600000000001s)]
*  There's no way for us to know that. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1223.94s)]
*  All we know is that in all these clips that we saw and then anecdotal accounts from [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1225.58s)]
*  individual members talking to him. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1232.54s)]
*  I remember having one conversation with him on the phone where he was calling to tell [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1234.8200000000002s)]
*  me about his decision to re-expand two national monuments in Utah. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1238.8600000000001s)]
*  National monuments that together are, I think, larger than two Delawares. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1246.98s)]
*  He... [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1255.22s)]
*  A short time into the phone conversation, I could tell he was reading from a script [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1257.5s)]
*  and not only reading from a script, but his voice would start to trail off at the end [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1262.02s)]
*  of each sentence. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1266.74s)]
*  And so, yes, he was scripted. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1268.1s)]
*  When was that? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1271.82s)]
*  I believe this was sometime perhaps in the fall of 2021. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1273.58s)]
*  So right after he got elected. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1280.26s)]
*  But I'm not sure. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1281.74s)]
*  This one could have been in 2022. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1282.5s)]
*  That's crazy. I mean, I knew because his sister Val was telling other people that he [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1285.3799999999999s)]
*  had some kind of neurological impairment during the campaign, during the 2020 campaign. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1290.18s)]
*  So I... [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1295.22s)]
*  But what's interesting and infuriating and scary is that someone had to write that script [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1296.38s)]
*  for him. So anyone who's writing a script for a boss to perform a phone conversation [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1300.54s)]
*  is obviously fully aware that that guy is impaired. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1306.18s)]
*  Like, did you have scripts for phone conversations? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1308.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, occasionally, a U.S. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1311.5s)]
*  senator will have a list of calls to make. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1313.8200000000002s)]
*  And the senator's staff might say, here's what you ought to cover here. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1316.78s)]
*  This, this and this. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1320.42s)]
*  But the idea... [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1321.78s)]
*  Well, I get that. But I mean... [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1322.5800000000002s)]
*  The idea there is to read that and then say, OK, that's the stuff I'm going to say. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1324.14s)]
*  And have a colloquy. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1328.98s)]
*  But you don't actually read from a script when you're having a phone conversation with a [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1329.78s)]
*  colleague or a counterpart in the house or something like that, because people can tell. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1334.14s)]
*  There are all sorts of telltale signs that you're reading. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1339.42s)]
*  The way we pronounce certain words, the word to in the middle of a sentence, spoken [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1341.98s)]
*  colloquial anguish, it's going to be more of a ta than it is a to. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1349.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, there are things like that that can signal I am reading from a script. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1354.42s)]
*  And if you do that with a colleague or somebody that you have to interact with a lot, it's [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1359.26s)]
*  not going to be a trust building exercise. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1364.02s)]
*  Well, it's totally nuts. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1366.78s)]
*  I mean, but where does that leave us as citizens? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1368.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, you as a senator? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1371.02s)]
*  I mean, do we have a right to know what the hell is going on with our government? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1372.66s)]
*  Who's running it? What's going on with Biden? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1375.98s)]
*  Who knew for how long this is a massive charade? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1377.86s)]
*  It's obvious now the whole thing is fake. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1381.26s)]
*  I mean, that's the conclusion that I'm reaching. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1383.46s)]
*  Don't we have a right to know the details? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1386.06s)]
*  Of course, of course we do, because we should be concerned because this potentially affects [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1388.26s)]
*  our national security. This certainly affects all kinds of policy decisions, policy [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1392.42s)]
*  decisions. And, you know, one of the problems, of course, is that we've made the federal [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1397.9s)]
*  government as a whole more powerful than it was ever designed or intended to. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1402.58s)]
*  Remember, we've got three lawmaking functions or three functions of government, rather. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1407.26s)]
*  You've got the lawmaking function performed by Congress. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1413.22s)]
*  That's the most dangerous power. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1415.98s)]
*  It was therefore given to the most dangerous branch under circumstances where that branch, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1418.22s)]
*  the legislative branch, Congress, where I work, you can fire every member of the House [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1424.18s)]
*  every two years and one third of all the senators every two years because we've got the most [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1428.3s)]
*  dangerous power. Then you've got the executive branch headed by the president. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1431.98s)]
*  Whose job it is to enforce the laws. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1437.62s)]
*  And then you've got the judicial branch headed by the Supreme Court, whose job it is to interpret [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1439.98s)]
*  the laws and resolve individual disputes that arise about what the law put in place either [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1444.22s)]
*  by Congress or through the Constitution means. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1450.1s)]
*  So legislative power is by far the most dangerous. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1454.14s)]
*  But what's happened over the last 80 years or so, 85 years, basically since the New Deal [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1458.82s)]
*  era, Washington, D.C. got immensely more powerful starting on April 12th, 1937. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1464.66s)]
*  That's the day the Supreme Court decided a case called NLRB versus Jones and Loughlin [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1471.18s)]
*  Steel Company. I regard that as the switch in time that saved nine. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1475.02s)]
*  Remember, this is FDR's court. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1480.1000000000001s)]
*  I wrote a book about this a couple of years ago called Saving Nine. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1482.14s)]
*  FDR's court packing plan was moving forward. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1484.7s)]
*  Yes. And the justices panicked. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1487.14s)]
*  It's two years to the date after they had moved into their new building. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1489.66s)]
*  When they issued this decision in which Associate Justice Owen Roberts joined the court's [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1493.98s)]
*  liberals and came up with a new definition of the Commerce Clause, Commerce Clause gave [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1499.26s)]
*  Congress the power to regulate interstate commercial transactions and channels and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1504.46s)]
*  interstate channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1508.54s)]
*  All of a sudden on April 12th, 1937, the Supreme Court rewrote that so that the Commerce [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1514.86s)]
*  Clause also gave Congress the power to regulate anything and everything that when measured [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1519.5s)]
*  in the aggregate, if it's economic in nature, has a substantial effect on interstate [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1523.9s)]
*  commerce. Now, Tucker, what that means is Congress can regulate anything at once. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1528.94s)]
*  So all of a sudden, Congress went from a limited, narrow purpose legislative body to [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1532.22s)]
*  an open-ended one, rendering the 10th Amendment almost a nullity. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1538.86s)]
*  Because if any of the 18 articles of Article 1, Section 1, I'm sorry, Article 1, Section [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1542.9s)]
*  8, if any of those clauses are open-ended and limitless, the 10th Amendment means nothing. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1548.38s)]
*  So Congress found itself newly possessed of the power to regulate labor, manufacturing, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1554.94s)]
*  agriculture, mining, health, safety, and welfare, not just in the District of Columbia or in [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1560.3000000000002s)]
*  federal land or with federal funds, but anywhere, everywhere, as long as they said the magic words [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1566.46s)]
*  and connected it somehow to an impact on interstate commerce. Newly possessed with this power, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1573.0200000000002s)]
*  Congress realized, oh my gosh, we're going to be a lot more accountable. We're going to have to do [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1578.7s)]
*  a lot more work. So to a degree, they stopped passing laws and started passing a lot of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1582.06s)]
*  platitudes. We shall have good law in Area X, and we hereby delegate to agency or Department Y, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1589.74s)]
*  the power to make and interpret and enforce laws, carrying the full force of the federal [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1597.6599999999999s)]
*  government to enforce them in Area X. And from that moment forward, we delegated all this lawmaking [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1603.66s)]
*  power over to unelected, unaccountable agencies. This made the presidency and the executive branch [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1611.5800000000002s)]
*  vastly more powerful than it was ever intended to be. So what we've seen here, Tucker, is that [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1617.9s)]
*  the aggregation, the accumulation of power in the hands of the few, it's exactly why we have [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1623.1000000000001s)]
*  a constitution and exactly what our constitution has a belt and a set of suspenders and another [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1628.3s)]
*  belt and another set of suspenders in order to avoid. So power's been taken away from the [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1633.82s)]
*  American people in two steps. First, from the people to Washington, D.C., where we've [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1638.78s)]
*  federalized previously non-federal power. Then within Washington, D.C., we've taken the lawmaking [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1643.5s)]
*  power, the most dangerous power of government, away from the people's elected lawmakers over to [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1648.78s)]
*  unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, ostensibly serving under the leadership of the incumbent [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1655.02s)]
*  president. All of whom or many of whom have civil service protections that makes it impossible to [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1661.82s)]
*  fire them. So that's permanent Washington. It's not the elected officials. Permanent Washington. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1666.06s)]
*  Permanent Washington. And it's literally permanent. And by the way, at a time when, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1671.34s)]
*  you know, it's getting pretty hard to find a job in the United States, the federal government is on [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1675.42s)]
*  a hiring spree. Like they're expanding as everyone else is suffering. I mean, it's, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1679.98s)]
*  so but here's what I say, I say this with respect, but I've never understood this in the 35 years I [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1684.6200000000001s)]
*  spent in Washington. I saw Congress get less powerful every cycle and the executive get more [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1689.74s)]
*  powerful under Republicans and Democrats. And you sort of wonder like, where's the self-respect of [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1695.82s)]
*  Congress? Yes. So why don't they do something about that? James Madison didn't foresee this [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1700.38s)]
*  particular feature. James Madison predicted in Federalist 51 and I believe to some degree [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1706.62s)]
*  in Federalist 10 and 15, that power would be made to counteract power, that the natural incentives [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1714.54s)]
*  of the people serving in each branch would cause them to defend their own prerogatives. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1722.6999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. What I don't think he foresaw was this, this process by which [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1727.7399999999998s)]
*  federal authority would be suddenly become open-ended. Remember state legislatures [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1735.82s)]
*  are bound only by their state constitution in terms of what they can do. And broadly speaking, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1744.06s)]
*  they are what we call general purpose legislative bodies. They can legislate on pretty much anything [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1748.54s)]
*  as long as it's not prohibited by their state constitution or the US constitution. They can [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1753.26s)]
*  just legislate because they feel the need to. We can't, at least we're not supposed to. We're [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1758.7s)]
*  supposed to be dealing with interstate and foreign trade or commerce, immigration laws, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1764.38s)]
*  bankruptcy laws, uniform system of weights and measures, declaring war, granting letters of mark [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1770.0600000000002s)]
*  and reprisal, laws governing the disposition and use of federal land, the army, the navy, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1776.38s)]
*  how we coordinate national guards or militias as they're described in Article 1 Section 8, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1784.38s)]
*  and so forth. But there is no general purpose legislative power. There is nothing in there that [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1790.22s)]
*  says Congress shall have the power to enact laws to make life better for the American people or [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1794.62s)]
*  enact such laws as they deem appropriate for national legislation. Nothing of the sort. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1801.1s)]
*  So we've drifted so far from that. And once we drifted from that, which I believe occurred [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1807.1s)]
*  sort of by the extortive threat of the court packing plan on April 12th, 1937, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1811.58s)]
*  once we ceased to be a power, a legislative body of limited, enumerated powers, the die was cast [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1817.58s)]
*  because Congress knew we can't keep up with all that anyway. And even if we tried to, remember, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1827.82s)]
*  Tucker, whenever you make a new law, a national law especially, you're going to make one group of [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1832.46s)]
*  people happy. You're going to make a whole lot of other people very unhappy. And so this was an [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1838.22s)]
*  easy way toward the interest of the drive for perpetual or long-term incumbency to make it easier. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1844.7s)]
*  So imagine, for example, you're one of the people who voted for the original iterations [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1855.74s)]
*  of the Clean Air Act, which to put it in oversimplified terms, we shall have clean air. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1860.6200000000001s)]
*  What idiot's going to vote against that? And we hereby delegate to the EPA the power to make [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1866.94s)]
*  and interpret and then enforce laws carrying the force of generally applicable federal law, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1873.1s)]
*  regulations carrying the force of federal law, but decide what clean air is, what pollution is, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1878.78s)]
*  how much you can pollute and how much you'd be fine. If you do, years go by and the same people [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1884.2199999999998s)]
*  who voted for that see the EPA come out with some crazy ruling. To cite one example that we've seen [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1891.8999999999999s)]
*  at times in my state, they'll identify this region or that region of the state and say, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1897.8999999999999s)]
*  here are your ozone limits in that area. And you're going to have a really hard time getting [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1903.6599999999999s)]
*  permitting of any sort if you're out of compliance with ozone, but they'll set the ozone level [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1908.3s)]
*  sort of below or at the rate where Mother Nature herself has set them so that it's impossible to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1915.8999999999999s)]
*  comply. Now, a Congress wouldn't do that. And if it did do that, it would be problems. People would [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1921.4199999999998s)]
*  be held accountable for that. But when EPA does it, members of Congress have this way of saying, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1926.7s)]
*  to their constituents who come in and say, this is shutting down my business. We can't operate [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1931.82s)]
*  this way. You got to fix it. They'll say, yeah, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to write [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1935.5800000000002s)]
*  them a strongly worded letter. I'm going to tell them that I mean it. Hey guys, knock this off. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1939.74s)]
*  It's like the Robin Williams used to just describe the unarmed English Bobby who being [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1945.74s)]
*  unarmed upon seeing the commission of a crime would yell on this very British accent, stop, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1953.02s)]
*  or I'll yell stop again. Social media are great. They're important. They're the main way we [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1957.66s)]
*  communicate with each other. They're where politics happen in this country. But one of [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1963.74s)]
*  the problems with social media is that the rules change. The people in charge don't want you to say [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1967.9s)]
*  something. They don't tell you that. And the next thing you know, you're without a platform. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1971.98s)]
*  Well, now you have an option. Parler, it's back. The original free speech app taken off the internet [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1977.34s)]
*  by the censors has come back in full force. Parler was the first big app to be pulled off [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1984.7s)]
*  because it was the first big app to make free speech a top priority. Now other platforms may [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1992.54s)]
*  be relaxing their policies and they change a lot, but Parler will not change. Its distinct approach [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=1997.66s)]
*  is here to stay by paving the way for other apps protect users free speech. Parler has set the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2004.86s)]
*  standard in the industry. It is now launched on a hyper scale private cloud called parlor cloud, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2009.74s)]
*  and that means your data are secure. Your words cannot be controlled by third party companies. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2016.62s)]
*  It's uncancellable. Again, parlor has been canceled. They don't plan to be canceled again, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2022.2199999999998s)]
*  and they've taken extensive and very expensive steps to make sure it's not going to happen. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2028.06s)]
*  Parler is not at the mercy of other companies that don't believe in free speech. And here's the best [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2033.26s)]
*  part. It's ad free. You are not the product on parlor. Parler is committed to providing a space [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2038.22s)]
*  where you can share and engage without interference of ads or invasive targeting. So it's more than [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2043.42s)]
*  just a platform. It is effectively a movement and its goal is to keep the free flow of information [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2049.66s)]
*  open globally where everybody can talk without fear of suppression. So it's upholding the values this [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2054.3s)]
*  country was founded on free expression, open dialogue, also innovation, by the way, we're on [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2060.62s)]
*  parlor at Tucker Carlson, and you can go there and find us and stay informed about what's happening [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2067.1s)]
*  in the world. So join a place that embraces your right to say what you actually think and that [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2073.18s)]
*  fosters connections between people. Without free speech, you can't connect with other people. We're [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2079.74s)]
*  all just lying to each other. But parlor offers you that a seamless social media experience tailored [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2084.54s)]
*  to your needs. You can get parlor from the App Store, Google Play, or visit parlor.com. At parlor, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2089.98s)]
*  you are valued, you can say what you think, and you're awarded for doing so. But I get maybe what [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2096.14s)]
*  Madison and the other framers never foresaw. I mean, they set up a system that inherent power [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2102.22s)]
*  struggles. Like that's the point, right? But I don't think they foresaw that there are people [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2107.42s)]
*  who actually don't want power because it comes with too much responsibility, accountability. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2111.9s)]
*  It's scary to them. And they'd rather sort of pass the buck, pass the power to somebody else. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2116.3s)]
*  I mean, that's what it looks like to me. Yes. Yeah. And I think that is an accurate description [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2121.34s)]
*  of it. And I think, Tucker, it's easy for that to happen once you leave the domain of limited [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2126.78s)]
*  legislative jurisdiction. And you become an open ended lawmaking body where the sky is the limit. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2136.86s)]
*  And where you've got a big country, the world's biggest economy, the world's most powerful military, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2144.14s)]
*  there's so many things to deal with. It's easy. It can even feel like the logical thing to do [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2150.06s)]
*  to delegate out this decision making process, or at least a lot of it. But you cut out voters, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2156.3799999999997s)]
*  you cut out the citizens when you do that. Exactly. That's the whole point. Remember, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2162.14s)]
*  the progressive dream for us, for those of us who love liberty, this is a nightmare. But the [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2165.66s)]
*  dream of the progressives is government of, by, and for the experts, masterminds, those who could [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2175.1s)]
*  come in and say, oh, we're the very scientific elite experts, and we know exactly how the people [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2183.74s)]
*  need to be governed. The totally useless class who actually could not get jobs in any other [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2189.8199999999997s)]
*  place than NGOs and federal agencies. But Tucker, these are experts, and many of them have master's [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2195.58s)]
*  degrees and PhDs and highly specialized in their field, and they really know their stuff. Can you [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2201.5s)]
*  fix my air conditioner? No, you can't. Not worth a darn. No, that's exactly right. So how long, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2207.1s)]
*  I mean, just, I didn't even realize, you trace this back to 1937 to the New Deal. I didn't even [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2213.18s)]
*  know that. But it makes sense. How long before the United States Senate becomes the Roman Senate, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2218.7799999999997s)]
*  and becomes just a useless appendage, and then disappears? Look, we're on that path. The more [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2224.4599999999996s)]
*  we strengthen the executive branch, the more that power, we take that away, power away from [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2230.9399999999996s)]
*  the American people and from their elected lawmakers, the closer we get to that. I think we're on almost a [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2235.5s)]
*  parabolic curve in that direction. We're getting closer and closer to it. I think there's still [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2244.4599999999996s)]
*  time to turn it around, but we have to do it. Let me give you some examples of why. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2249.58s)]
*  In my office in Washington, you should come by sometime. I'll show you my monument to the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2255.98s)]
*  constitutional problems we face. I keep two stacks of documents in my office in the Russell Building [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2262.54s)]
*  in Washington. One stack of documents is a few inches tall, and it's a few hundred to a few thousand [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2267.98s)]
*  pages long, and it consisted of the laws passed by Congress in the last year. Some would argue that [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2274.54s)]
*  that's a few hundred or a few thousand pages, too many, but regardless, those are laws passed by [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2279.5s)]
*  Congress last year. Then there's the other stack. The other stack, which is printed on double-sided [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2284.38s)]
*  paper, very thin paper, very small print, is the Federal Register. For those people who are [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2290.62s)]
*  unburdened by knowledge of what the Federal Register is, I wish I weren't burdened by it. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2298.46s)]
*  Federal Register is the annual cumulative index of federal regulations as they're announced, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2306.7s)]
*  first for notice and comment, and then once they're finalized. They go out, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2312.22s)]
*  peasants, prepare to be regulated. Give us your thoughts on this so as to replicate some sort of [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2316.38s)]
*  feeling of a democratic input process. They don't really care at the end of the day [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2320.62s)]
*  what the public comments and response, and then they finalize it. Those are 100,000 pages, more or [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2326.94s)]
*  less, that get issued every year. 100,000 pages of federal regulations every year. Well, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2333.42s)]
*  just regulations. They sound softer than laws. In some cases, maybe they are, but those 100,000 pages [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2339.1s)]
*  are replete with a lot of things that are just law. They have all the incidents of law, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2346.14s)]
*  other than that they haven't been enacted by Congress. But they're enforced with firearms. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2355.58s)]
*  Yes, they're enforced in almost every industry you can think of. Almost every aspect of human [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2360.14s)]
*  existence has a federal agency, sometimes more, regulating that area. Interesting story, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2365.74s)]
*  a few years ago, a few of us on the Judiciary Committee on which I sit submitted a request [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2374.7799999999997s)]
*  to the Congressional Research Service to help us answer a question. The question was essentially, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2381.18s)]
*  tell us how many federal crimes are on the books? How many provisions of federal law create a crime? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2386.7s)]
*  We wanted to know more or less the universe of federal crimes that exist. The answer took a [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2392.9399999999996s)]
*  while. When it came back, it was stunning. It said the answer is unknown and unknowable, but it's at [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2400.54s)]
*  least 300,000 crimes. And a lot of that had to do with the fact that this Byzantine labyrinth [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2407.2599999999998s)]
*  of federal regulations, about 100,000 pages a year, which initially go into this massive document, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2414.94s)]
*  about 100,000 pages per year, called the Federal Register. Ultimately, they'll be codified into a [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2422.38s)]
*  larger catalog known as the Code of Federal Regulations. There are so many criminal [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2427.6600000000003s)]
*  provisions of those regulations that it makes it very difficult to count, but it's at least 300,000. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2435.1s)]
*  And these are devised by federal employees who are not judges. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2442.06s)]
*  Correct. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2447.42s)]
*  And they're not elected lawmakers. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2447.9s)]
*  Correct. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2449.2599999999998s)]
*  So, I mean, again, you're the constitutional scholar, but I don't see where they have the [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2450.38s)]
*  authority to do that. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2454.46s)]
*  But Tucker, they're experts. How could you not trust experts? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2455.42s)]
*  Well, leaving aside the fact that most- [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2458.46s)]
*  Unwashed masses in Congress. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2459.66s)]
*  They're like some of the, I mean, I've spent a lot of time around them. My dad [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2461.18s)]
*  ran a federal agency. I'm certainly very familiar with them, but even if they were impressive, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2464.46s)]
*  which they're not, that still seems like an end-run around democracy. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2469.26s)]
*  It is. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2473.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2473.9s)]
*  And that's the whole point. That's the whole point is that you don't trust governance to the peasants. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2474.2200000000003s)]
*  You've got to trust the governance to the experts. That is the progressive dream. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2480.7000000000003s)]
*  So, ultimately, while progressives tout themselves as being incredibly democratic, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2486.2200000000003s)]
*  they're actually quite the opposite. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2491.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2494.1400000000003s)]
*  They're the most anti-democratic species you'll find in American policies. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2494.5400000000004s)]
*  They just prosecuted a coup against a sitting, supposedly, elected president who got several [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2499.74s)]
*  billion votes, they've told us, for the past four years. And they just took him out because [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2505.82s)]
*  they didn't like his polling. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2509.42s)]
*  Right. And they'll be the first ones to defend this. Now, there is a fix to this. And it's one [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2511.1s)]
*  that I've been pushing the entire time I've been in the Senate. I've now made it my single most [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2517.02s)]
*  top priority. The closest thing there is to a silver bullet fix to this problem, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2522.94s)]
*  of lawmaking by executive branch agency, is a proposal known as the Reigns Act. It's R-E-I-N-S. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2528.46s)]
*  It's an acronym that stands for regulations from the executive in need of scrutiny. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2536.38s)]
*  And what it says, it would require us to follow, essentially, that the existing requirements of [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2541.5s)]
*  Article 1, Section 7. Remember Article 1, Section 1, the very first operative provision of the [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2548.86s)]
*  Constitution says that all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in Congress. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2554.14s)]
*  Article 1, Section 7 makes abundantly clear that there is only one way to make a federal law. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2559.2599999999998s)]
*  You have to have bicameral passage of the same bill text. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2565.2599999999998s)]
*  House and Senate, most of the time, it doesn't matter in which order, unless it's a revenue bill [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2569.58s)]
*  that has to start in the House. But other than that, it doesn't matter in which order. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2577.1s)]
*  And the House and the Senate have to pass the same text, and then you present it to the President [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2581.42s)]
*  for signature, veto, or acquiescence. That's the only formula by which you can make a federal law. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2584.94s)]
*  We've been disregarding that for a long time. So what the Reigns Act says is that if there is [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2590.86s)]
*  a federal regulation on the one hand that operates internally, doesn't have, it's not a major rule, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2595.02s)]
*  meaning it doesn't impose affirmative legal obligations on the part of the American public [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2600.7s)]
*  and isn't economically significant. Maybe it determines what time the lights go on and off [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2605.42s)]
*  in the Department of Commerce. The Reigns Act wouldn't worry about that. But for the outward [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2609.5s)]
*  facing affirmative legal obligations, economically significant or otherwise qualifying as what we [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2614.54s)]
*  call a major rule, those rules, those regulations wouldn't be self-executing. They couldn't take [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2618.94s)]
*  effect automatically. They couldn't take effect, in fact, unless or until Congress affirmatively [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2624.94s)]
*  enacted that regulation into law. And so that way, for those who are concerned about making sure that [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2630.54s)]
*  we preserve the expertise that we've got in these federal agencies, we're not discarding that. We're [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2638.06s)]
*  actually giving them probably more of an advantage than they should have, even under the Reigns Act, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2644.06s)]
*  by virtue of the fact that these things would be considered on a fast track basis. But the American [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2649.42s)]
*  people would be in charge because they couldn't become law unless both houses of Congress enacted [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2655.5s)]
*  it into law. I've been trying to get this passed for a very long time. When Trump took office in [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2661.58s)]
*  2017, I put it in the overdrive and went to a bunch of my Democratic colleagues, member by member, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2666.38s)]
*  saying, I know you must be concerned about this presidency because it's all they talked about. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2673.34s)]
*  And if you are concerned about it, you really ought to look into the Reigns Act, because look [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2677.82s)]
*  at all the control that this president has over regulations. This is something that should not [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2682.78s)]
*  be partisan. It shouldn't be just a Republican thing, even though almost everybody who supports [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2687.58s)]
*  the Reigns Act happens to be a Republican. To a person, they all said essentially the same thing, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2691.98s)]
*  Mike, we need the expertise of those agencies. To which I'd say, we'd still have it. We still have [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2698.22s)]
*  it. It's just, we would be the ultimate. Has anyone ever met a federal employee? And there's some, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2703.42s)]
*  again, I'm the son of one, but there are some good federal employees. But in general, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2708.62s)]
*  you know, people who can't be fired don't perform as you'd hope. I mean, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2713.26s)]
*  it's pretty mediocre. So what, okay, so Biden's now or Biden, Biden takes in he exists. The people [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2718.3s)]
*  who are controlling Biden are making noises about reforming the Supreme Court. What is that? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2724.2200000000003s)]
*  That is a bald-faced attempt for him to end run what he himself said in the early 1980s as a U.S. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2730.38s)]
*  Senator. It was, I believe, 1982 or 1983 when he described- It was on the Judiciary Committee. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2735.82s)]
*  Yes, on the Judiciary Committee. I think he was chairman at the time by then. He said, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2740.86s)]
*  it was a boneheaded idea when FDR proposed packing the court. He appears to be going back on that [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2746.22s)]
*  now. Now he's kind of soft-pedaled his way into court packing. Little by little, he's getting [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2752.94s)]
*  there. He keeps talking about Supreme Court reform. He's been increasingly flirtatious with the idea [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2760.54s)]
*  of court packing. He's trying to impose this new set of ethical standards from one branch to another. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2764.94s)]
*  Can you just define court packing? Yeah. Court packing consists of something that is technically [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2772.14s)]
*  allowed by the Constitution because the Constitution doesn't prescribe the size of [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2779.02s)]
*  the Supreme Court. That is set by statute. But for over 150 years, we have had nine justices [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2784.3s)]
*  on the court. There have been times when that number has been higher. There have been times [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2794.86s)]
*  when the number has been lower. But we've had more than a century and a half where it's been [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2802.38s)]
*  consistently at nine justices. My view and the view of most people, including Joe Biden [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2806.7000000000003s)]
*  until a few years ago, including the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2814.06s)]
*  who was a very good friend of mine, just not too long before she died, acknowledged that it's a bad [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2821.1s)]
*  idea to change that number, even though constitutionally we're allowed to do it by statute. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2827.18s)]
*  Because what you'd end up with, Tucker, is you'd end up politicizing the court. Whatever [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2832.78s)]
*  administration that decides to do this would only do it most likely with a Congress and a Senate [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2837.74s)]
*  willing to put in, and a president willing to put in justices of that party's political ideology, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2846.54s)]
*  such that people would stop seeing the court as an adjudicative body and much more as a political [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2855.3399999999997s)]
*  one, especially since once we start this, it'll set off a nuclear chain reaction. Now, I've always [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2864.14s)]
*  been opposed to court packing. I think all Republicans have, all Democrats have, until very [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2869.4199999999996s)]
*  recently. But if Democrats take this step, let's imagine, knock on wood, let's hope this doesn't [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2873.66s)]
*  happen. I don't think it'll happen. But if somehow in this year's election, Democrats were to win [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2879.98s)]
*  the White House, keep the majority in the Senate, and perhaps even expand their majority and win [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2886.7799999999997s)]
*  back the House, I have no doubt but that they would pack the court, meaning expand the court. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2893.58s)]
*  They would increase it probably by four justices, taking it from nine to 13. Now, just imagine the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2900.46s)]
*  next time when political forces are such that Republicans take it back. You think Republicans [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2907.18s)]
*  could possibly decide, now that's fine, we're not going to do this. There would be immense political [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2915.18s)]
*  pressure on us at that point, Republican lawmakers, to add an additional four or five, six or seven. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2920.62s)]
*  And the pendulum would swing back and forth, and as it swung, each time it swung, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2927.3399999999997s)]
*  you would see additional appointments made to the Supreme Court. And before long, it would start to [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2931.58s)]
*  look like the Intergalactic Senate on the Star Wars movies. Yeah, or the Brazilian Supreme Court, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2936.7s)]
*  you know. But can I ask, I mean, if Kamala Harris gets elected president and the Senate in the House [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2941.1s)]
*  fall to Democrats, Senate majorities expanded, I mean, they're never going to be another Republican [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2950.38s)]
*  government after that. I mean, that's a one-party state at that point. They're not going to go [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2956.38s)]
*  through this again, are they? Well, that is of grave concern because if that were to happen, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2959.42s)]
*  there are some changes to the law that I fear they would put through. These voting rights bills that [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2966.86s)]
*  they keep talking about wanting to pass are among them. So they pass these voting rights laws. We [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2973.5s)]
*  already have voting rights, don't we? We do. But they keep touting them, you know, under the banal [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2979.5s)]
*  banner of civil rights and making all Americans able to vote. They want to subject any state law [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2985.82s)]
*  decisions regarding legislative redistricting within the state to pre-clearance by political [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=2994.54s)]
*  appointees within what they envision as a Democratic presidential administration. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3001.6600000000003s)]
*  So they would have to come to the federal political appointees and say, Mother, may I [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3008.94s)]
*  adopt this legislative redistricting plan or this or that set of reforms to the way we conduct our [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3017.42s)]
*  elections? And those would have to be pre-approved. They also want to essentially divest the power to [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3026.06s)]
*  draw legislative boundaries from the state legislatures and give them to nonpartisan [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3034.38s)]
*  independent commissions, thus further taking away the power from elected lawmakers and putting it [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3041.98s)]
*  in the hands of unelected, unaccountable experts. These sorts of things, coupled with what I fear [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3047.82s)]
*  they would also do, they would enact another law bringing the District of Columbia into the [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3055.02s)]
*  family of states, making DC a state and perhaps Puerto Rico as a state if they conclude that [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3063.02s)]
*  Puerto Rico and DC would be reliable Democratic seats. I mean, as long as we're picking up [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3067.8199999999997s)]
*  completely dysfunctional territories incapable of governing themselves, why not Haiti too? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3072.3799999999997s)]
*  Why not? Well, Haiti isn't currently a U.S. territory, so that would be the biggest distinction. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3077.1s)]
*  That's insane. I mean, you spend a lot of your life in the District of Columbia, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3083.58s)]
*  a lot of good things to say about it. I spent my whole life there. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3086.14s)]
*  But there's no self-government. They're not capable of self-government. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3089.34s)]
*  No. Look at the city. I mean, that's crazy. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3093.42s)]
*  And more to the point, Tucker, it's really small, it's geographically compact, but perhaps of [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3095.82s)]
*  most importance. The Founding Fathers set aside this idea of an independent district, what became [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3101.7400000000002s)]
*  the District of Columbia, for the purpose of wanting an independent, neutral place [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3111.5s)]
*  that could serve as the seat of our national government. And so they had land donated, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3117.98s)]
*  roughly half and half from Maryland and Virginia. I think the Maryland side was a little bigger. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3123.66s)]
*  Decades later, maybe a century or so later, sometime in the late 1800s, I believe, they [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3130.7799999999997s)]
*  decided that the Virginia portion of it wasn't necessary for the seat of national government, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3137.18s)]
*  so that was given back to the state of Virginia. That's now Arlington. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3141.58s)]
*  Right. And then what remains of it was the Maryland contribution. So the remedy here, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3145.02s)]
*  if they want to be a state, if they want to have representation, voting representation in the House [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3153.66s)]
*  and two senators in the Senate, the way to do that is to give the Maryland portion of DC, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3158.62s)]
*  or at least that portion of it that's not deemed necessary to the independent functioning of [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3164.86s)]
*  the national seat of government back to Maryland. This was part of a state from the beginning, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3172.22s)]
*  and it should not be its own independent state now. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3177.74s)]
*  Of course. Let's just a pure power grab. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3179.42s)]
*  It's a power grab because they want to pick up four of what they would regard as consistently [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3180.7799999999997s)]
*  reliably democratic senators. So if they adopt those reforms and then these voting rights [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3186.14s)]
*  reforms, we could see the Democrats finally achieving their goal. I've never heard them [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3192.94s)]
*  articulate it like this, but I think they look at other countries and they crave what other [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3198.22s)]
*  countries have been able to do. Take for example, our Southern neighbor, Mexico. For close to a [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3203.4199999999996s)]
*  century, Mexico was governed, lock, stock and barrel by one political party, el Partido [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3208.9399999999996s)]
*  Revolucionario Institucional. Exactly. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3217.02s)]
*  PRI. It's interesting when you think about it, by the way, how can a party be at once [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3219.66s)]
*  revolutionary and institutional, but progressive? That's what they do. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3225.34s)]
*  I've noticed that. Most of us, well, actually all of us, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3229.82s)]
*  go through our daily lives using all sorts of quote free technology without paying attention [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3233.26s)]
*  to why it's quote free. Who's paying for this and how think about it from it. Think about your free [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3238.7000000000003s)]
*  email account, the free messenger system used to chat with your friends, the free other weather [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3245.34s)]
*  app or game app you open up and never think about it's all free. But is it? No, it's not free. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3251.1s)]
*  These companies aren't developing expensive products and just giving them to you because [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3259.1s)]
*  they love you. They're doing it because their programs take all your information. They hoover [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3262.86s)]
*  up your data, private personal data and sell it to data brokers and the government. And all of [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3268.46s)]
*  those people who are not your friends are very interested in manipulating you and your personal [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3275.82s)]
*  political and financial decisions. It's scary as hell and it's happening out in the open without [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3280.94s)]
*  anybody saying anything about it. This is a huge problem and we've been talking about this problem [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3286.2200000000003s)]
*  to our friend Eric Prince for years. Someone needs to fix this and he and his partners have. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3291.7400000000002s)]
*  And now we're partners with them and their company is called Unplugged. It's not a software company, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3296.78s)]
*  it's a hardware company. They actually make a phone. The phone is called Unplugged and it's [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3301.9s)]
*  more than that. The purpose of the phone is to protect you from having your life stolen, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3308.14s)]
*  your data stolen. It's designed from a privacy first perspective. It's got an operating system [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3315.58s)]
*  that they made. It's called Messenger and other apps that help you take charge of your personal [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3322.06s)]
*  data and prevent it from getting passed around to data brokers and government agencies that will use [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3325.58s)]
*  it to manipulate you. Unplugged's commitment is to its customers. They will promise you and they mean [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3330.94s)]
*  it that your data are not being sold or monetized or shared with anyone. From basics like its custom [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3336.46s)]
*  Libertas operating system, which they wrote, which is designed from the very first day to [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3343.02s)]
*  keep your personal data on your device. It also has, believe it or not, a true on-off switch that [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3347.42s)]
*  shuts off the power. It actually disconnects your battery and ensures that your microphone and your [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3354.06s)]
*  camera are turned off completely when you want them to be so they're not spying on you and say [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3359.34s)]
*  your bedroom, which your iPhone is. That's a fact. So it is a great way, one of the few ways to [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3364.38s)]
*  actually protect yourself from big tech and big government to reclaim your personal privacy. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3370.54s)]
*  Without privacy, there is no freedom. The unplugged phone, you can get a $25 discount when you use the [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3375.7400000000002s)]

*  That party governed Mexico with an iron fist for the better part of a century. And I suspect that [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3388.62s)]
*  something like that is what they would like to do. And something like that is what they would be [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3397.74s)]
*  able to achieve if they swept the House and the Senate and the White House this year. I think [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3402.14s)]
*  they've got ambitions to go in that direction. That's why there's no question. I mean, they're [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3407.74s)]
*  totalitarian. I mean, Steve Bannon is in jail right now. A bunch of people I know have gone to [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3411.18s)]
*  prison. While fentanyl dealers remain in, tens of millions of illegals are, I mean, obviously, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3415.98s)]
*  that's their goal is totalitarian rule. But I wonder if it's possible this cycle. What do you think? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3422.38s)]
*  Could Kamala Harris win? She could win. There's no question about it. And Republicans would [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3427.7400000000002s)]
*  make a huge mistake by discounting her. If by discounting her, they're assuming we don't have [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3434.46s)]
*  to work that hard to defeat her. Few things we know about Kamala Harris. Well, she's the, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3442.22s)]
*  I mean, technically the head of the body you serve in. Yes, she's the president of the Senate. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3447.8999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris, despite her gaffes that we've seen, when she's operating on script and she's got, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3453.4199999999996s)]
*  when she's got good staff preparing her material and she sticks to that material, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3459.18s)]
*  she's actually pretty good. Now, I disagree with almost everything she says. Of course. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3463.8999999999996s)]
*  But when she stays on script, she can be a compelling speech speaker, far more compelling [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3468.46s)]
*  than President Biden. I mean, Biden of yesteryear did a better job than he's done in the last few [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3474.06s)]
*  years. But she's a much more compelling speaker than others. And I think she's going to be very [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3481.5s)]
*  carefully scripted over the next few months. So yeah, I think we should be very worried about it. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3487.18s)]
*  We've already seen the media sponsored apotheosis of Kamala Harris. I always think about this, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3492.14s)]
*  the great, the great mural. I guess it's a fresco, technically at the top of the [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3502.14s)]
*  Capitol rotunda, the inside of the dome. You've got this beautiful painting by Constantino, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3513.3399999999997s)]
*  Constantino Grumidi, an Italian born American immigrant. And it's called the apotheosis of [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3519.66s)]
*  George Washington. It shows George Washington, ascending into heaven following his death. And [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3526.22s)]
*  he's surrounded by these 13 angels, each representing one of the original colonies. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3532.54s)]
*  And he's surrounded and then there are two other angels right next to him, one of which represents [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3537.18s)]
*  Liberty. And the other one represents the majesty of government or something like that. And it's, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3542.62s)]
*  he's being glorified and almost deified. There is a very familiar ring, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3547.66s)]
*  connection between that painting and what the media is trying to portray of Kamala Harris. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3558.46s)]
*  In the last few days, you've seen the complete erasure of any reference to Kamala Harris being [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3563.3399999999997s)]
*  the border czar, which didn't go well. There's been an effort, a sustained and fairly successful [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3569.4199999999996s)]
*  effort by the media to erase the fact that she was widely regarded as one of the most, if not [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3575.26s)]
*  the very most, progressive liberal member of the United States Senate. There's been this rebirth of [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3580.78s)]
*  Kamala Harris as this great warrior who is ready, willing and able at a moment's notice to take the [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3591.1000000000004s)]
*  reins as America's chief executive. And they're scrubbing things she has said in the past, crazy [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3600.78s)]
*  statements she's made from defunding the police to aggressive, radical climate change policies, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3607.5800000000004s)]
*  green new deal stuff. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. They're papering over all of that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3615.26s)]
*  So yes, Kamala Harris is a threat because she's got this media industrial complex. It's completely [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3621.82s)]
*  behind her. How much since she is the president of the Senate and you've been a senator for 13 and [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3629.1s)]
*  a half years, how much contact? Well, of course, you served in the Senate with her. Yes. What's [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3633.2599999999998s)]
*  she like? She's a lot like how she seems on TV. She's got a funny, playful side to her. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3638.94s)]
*  When she is on script, she can be very emotionally compelling in her speech, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3649.02s)]
*  but she is very, very liberal. And especially when she went off script in the Senate Judiciary [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3657.2599999999998s)]
*  Committee, you could tell that. You could tell. So you served on the committee with her? Oh, yeah. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3663.66s)]
*  Yeah. Served on the committee with her. We worked together in the Senate for four years. So she was [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3669.74s)]
*  elected in 2016 and she remained in the Senate until she became vice president. So what was she [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3674.8599999999997s)]
*  like in committee? She was feisty, definitely one of the most far left members of the committee. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3682.14s)]
*  She did not hesitate to take what I thought were very aggressive attacks against Trump era. Remember [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3690.54s)]
*  the entire time that she and I were in the Senate at the same time, the entire time she was in the [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3699.8199999999997s)]
*  Senate, corresponded precisely with Donald Trump's time as president. She was one who never hesitated [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3706.22s)]
*  to take really aggressive and sometimes cheap pot shots at President Trump's judicial nominees and [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3716.9399999999996s)]
*  at times badly mischaracterize them, Donald Trump, his positions and his personnel. Did you get a [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3723.8199999999997s)]
*  sense that she regarded the Constitution as sacred or even important? Well, she's certainly one who would [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3731.26s)]
*  pay lip service to the Constitution, to channel the inner Isaiah, to draw near to the Constitution [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3741.98s)]
*  with her lips. Well, her heart may have been far from it because she didn't seem to acknowledge [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3747.7400000000002s)]
*  key core limitations on the Constitution. I never saw from her an acceptance or an [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3753.1s)]
*  understanding of the twin structural protections of the Constitution, the vertical protection that [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3760.7s)]
*  we call federalism, leaving most of the power at the states and localities or the horizontal protection [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3766.3s)]
*  that we call separation of powers. Never saw that from her and I saw a hyper obsessiveness [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3772.38s)]
*  on focusing on certain rights that were invented out of whole cloth by the Supreme Court. She's an abortion fanatic [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3780.3799999999997s)]
*  and I think even if you think of yourself as pro-choice, which I definitely don't, but you know a lot [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3787.4199999999996s)]
*  of good people do think of themselves as pro-choice, it's hard to understand the fanaticism, the sort of [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3792.2999999999997s)]
*  crazed wild-eyed enthusiasm for abortion from her. What do you think that is? Yeah, well, part of this, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3797.9799999999996s)]
*  I suspect she may be a product of her training, her education, her upbringing, and her political [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3805.58s)]
*  coming of age. American law schools, with very few exceptions, tend to indoctrinate for whatever [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3812.94s)]
*  reason. Roe versus Wade and things, it's like more fundamental than Magna Carta to many. It's more [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3820.54s)]
*  fundamental than the Bill of Rights. I mean, these are people who don't think you have a right to say [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3827.7400000000002s)]
*  what you think, travel where you want to travel, associate with who you want to associate with. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3831.26s)]
*  The core human rights bestowed by God they do not acknowledge, defend yourself, but you do have a [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3835.1s)]
*  right to kill your child? Like, what is that? Yeah, it's a weird thing. I've never seen anything [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3840.14s)]
*  like it and whenever you have a chance with a progressive colleague, if you ask them, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3846.06s)]
*  what exactly is it in the Constitution that does that, then they'll have to go through. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3855.1s)]
*  Why are they so obsessed with it? Look, if you make the case that a 13-year-old girl raped, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3860.78s)]
*  wants to have an abortion, even people opposed to abortion, I kind of get why you feel that way. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3866.3s)]
*  But the idea that abortion makes you happy, that it's the only in a country that doesn't, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3871.5s)]
*  we're not at replacement birth rate. So the one thing we need to do is have more abortions. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3876.3s)]
*  Where the hell does that come from? Yeah, it's weird. It's become, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3881.7400000000002s)]
*  instead of being safe, legal and rare, as sort of the Clinton-era Democratic Party [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3885.42s)]
*  sold it, abortion should be safe, legal and rare. It's now a sacrament. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3890.6200000000003s)]
*  And you've got people being encouraged now to share their stories, women who have had abortions [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3898.1400000000003s)]
*  being encouraged to share their stories of why it was such a good thing that they had one, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3903.42s)]
*  which seems really awful. So awful. It seems to me, just like your conventional human sacrifice [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3910.06s)]
*  cult that every civilization has had. Mulock. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3918.06s)]
*  Mulock. Well, it does seem that, I mean, I never thought that because I grew up in a world where [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3920.94s)]
*  people made arguments in favor of abortion or opposed to abortion on the basis of science or [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3926.62s)]
*  their understanding of it, or on the basis of extenuating circumstances like rape, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3931.18s)]
*  you know, minors being pregnant. Okay, I get it. But I never imagined a world where the [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3936.2200000000003s)]
*  treasury secretary would be like, the one thing you can do to help America and its economy is [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3940.5400000000004s)]
*  have more abortions, as Jenny Allen said, like, that's just religion. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3943.9s)]
*  Yes. Yes, it is. And they're asked to accept it as if a religious article of faith. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3947.9s)]
*  I still remember the first time I learned about Roe versus Wade. I was 10 years old. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3953.0200000000004s)]
*  My dad had just been appointed by President Reagan as the Solicitor General of the United [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3958.78s)]
*  States, the Chief Appellate Advocate for the US government before the Supreme Court. And I was [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3964.54s)]
*  asking him some questions about his job. And he mentioned Roe versus Wade. And he said, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3970.62s)]
*  do you know what that is? And I just finished the fourth grade. And I said, no, not really. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3974.22s)]
*  What's that? And he explained it to me. And he said, what do you think of that? And I said, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3978.7s)]
*  well, I'm not sure that I see this as seems like a legislative decision rather than a judicial [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3983.5s)]
*  one. So that's one problem. The other problem is I don't see anything in the Constitution that [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3990.3799999999997s)]
*  makes this a federal issue. This seems like one that maybe ought to be ironed out more by the [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=3994.54s)]
*  states. I don't think I'd ever see my dad more happy to know that one of his children had listened [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4000.22s)]
*  to his discussions about federalism and separation of powers and that sort of thing. But if that was [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4007.2599999999998s)]
*  evidence... Kind of funny you were having this conversation in fourth grade. Well, all families [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4013.18s)]
*  have that conversation about that age. About separation of powers. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4017.42s)]
*  Exactly. Percent of clause over potatoes. It's not like Howard and Bengals this season. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4022.94s)]
*  I think it was 30 before I realized not every family talks about that. But anyway, that was [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4026.62s)]
*  evident to me as a fourth grader. And it's not like we were talking about that all the time. We [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4032.38s)]
*  talked about it more than other families did because my dad was a professor of constitutional [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4036.86s)]
*  law and then the Solicitor General of the United States. But that was evident to me just based on [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4041.42s)]
*  the face of it. This was never something that should have been shoved down the throats of the [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4046.22s)]
*  American people. This is a fundamentally legislative decision because it's a policy choice. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4050.3799999999997s)]
*  And it's a policy choice that is nowhere directed, required, or commanded by the Constitution. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4054.62s)]
*  And because there's nothing about it that makes it federal, it is the kind of policy decision that [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4060.06s)]
*  needs to be made with some exceptions like for, you know, where federal funding is involved, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4064.7799999999997s)]
*  federal territory, federal personnel or whatever, by state policymakers rather than national ones. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4069.98s)]
*  And yet when they undid Roe two years ago, you had all these people. One of my favorites was [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4076.62s)]
*  Prince Harry of all people. Prince Harry came out with this statement, oh, this is [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4085.58s)]
*  bad for democracy. And my response to that was, number one, it's rich being lectured [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4090.46s)]
*  on democracy by an actual prince, a literal lineal descendant, both through his mother and his father [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4097.26s)]
*  of King George III. But secondly, there was nothing democratic about Roe versus [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4107.18s)]
*  Wade. It was one of the most anti-democratic things we've seen. Could we deport Prince Harry? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4112.14s)]
*  In theory, if he does something wrong. Well, that's, I mean, I think he's crossed the line just with- [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4116.94s)]
*  Just how annoying he is. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4121.74s)]
*  Yes. So did you detect in Kamala Harris, just in the extensive time you spent with her as a colleague, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4122.62s)]
*  a set of principles, things that, you know, red lines she really cared about authentically? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4132.78s)]
*  Look, she's a progressive's progressive. If there was an opportunity to expand the size, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4138.78s)]
*  scope, reach and cost of the federal government, she supported those things. If there was an [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4143.98s)]
*  opportunity to expand what she would describe euphemistically as reproductive rights, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4147.34s)]
*  she was in favor of those things. Raising taxes, making the heavily graduated income tax system [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4153.5s)]
*  even more graduated, stick it to the rich, she was in favor of those things. So yeah, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4161.26s)]
*  her consistent threads, she was somewhat predictable in that regard. She had a fairly [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4166.14s)]
*  coherent legislative strategy. She would always do the thing that progressive Democrats really- [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4171.82s)]
*  Expanded their power. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4177.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4178.86s)]
*  So you're Mormon, part of the LDS church, I heard joking before we went on that you're [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4180.299999999999s)]
*  really part of me, you're related to everybody, you know everybody. And so you've been an, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4188.62s)]
*  which is a religious minority in this country, and so you've been an advocate, I think, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4192.54s)]
*  for religious liberties since you got there. Do you notice hostility toward Christianity increasing [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4195.66s)]
*  in Washington? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4205.58s)]
*  It's interesting. I think there is increased hostility toward Christianity, toward organized [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4207.18s)]
*  religion in general in Washington. Within the Senate itself, there is a pretty healthy culture [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4214.139999999999s)]
*  of respect of individual religious beliefs and backgrounds. And weekly prayer breakfast brings [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4222.78s)]
*  together Republicans and Democrats of every political stripe you can imagine, and every [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4233.74s)]
*  religious stripe you can imagine. In those contexts, there's very much an atmosphere of respect. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4239.099999999999s)]
*  But I've started seeing a couple of things that are disturbing that I never thought I would see, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4245.0199999999995s)]
*  just in the last few years. I remember during the Trump administration, we started to see, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4249.740000000001s)]
*  for the first time ever, a couple of my Democratic colleagues, including some on the judiciary [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4256.22s)]
*  committee, who would say things like this. I'm not comfortable with this nominee because I fear that [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4261.1s)]
*  the dogma lives loudly within her. This was, I believe, Senator Dianne Feinstein, speaking of [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4269.58s)]
*  then circuit judge nominee Amy Coney Barrett. She was afraid that she was too Catholic, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4277.58s)]
*  and that because the dogma, the Catholic dogma, as she put it, lives too loudly. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4284.54s)]
*  How dare she? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4289.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that was a little unsettling. On another occasion, my friend and colleague, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4290.46s)]
*  Maisie Arono, Democratic Senator from Hawaii, made a comment during a judiciary committee markup [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4295.98s)]
*  that she was concerned that we were seeing too many judicial nominees coming through the committee [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4304.14s)]
*  who had extreme religious beliefs. I think there was at least one other member of the committee [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4313.18s)]
*  who chimed in. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4320.06s)]
*  Christian beliefs. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4320.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they were typically Christian beliefs. She wasn't saying, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4321.58s)]
*  I'm worried that they're too Buddhist or too Zoroastrian. It was almost always, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4325.1s)]
*  I think, in the context of someone who was a Christian of one stripe or another. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4329.9s)]
*  I felt the need to weigh in at that meeting because sometimes we need to do that in order [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4335.259999999999s)]
*  to set the record and to give the member an opportunity to pare it back. I'm not sure she [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4339.179999999999s)]
*  realized exactly how far she went in saying that. That's a very collegial way of doing it. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4347.0199999999995s)]
*  I chimed in and I said, I need to set the record straight here. We need to be very careful when [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4353.5s)]
*  we talk about this. There are at least two, maybe three, maybe more provisions of the Constitution [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4359.34s)]
*  that I think caution us against and more appropriately prohibit us from imposing this [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4365.5s)]
*  kind of filter, from imposing a religious test, from discriminating against someone based on their [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4373.42s)]
*  free exercise of religion. We need to not do that. You can find the religious beliefs unusual [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4380.46s)]
*  or you might find them to be candidates that you don't want to support for some other reason. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4389.34s)]
*  But I don't think their religious beliefs should be on trial here. In fact, constitutionally, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4395.1s)]
*  they can't. I thought at that point she would back down or at least clarify or narrow her statement. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4399.5s)]
*  Instead, she said, no, I meant what I said. When I said what I meant, a lot of these nominees are [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4406.46s)]
*  just too extreme in their religious beliefs. I'm going to calm out. I'm going to oppose every one [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4414.3s)]
*  of them if I think their religious beliefs are too extreme. A lot of these, famously, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4418.46s)]
*  you don't have to comment because you said she's your friend, but Maisie Arano is not considered [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4423.1s)]
*  by the outside world a genius. But I wonder, to put it mildly, but I wonder if they see [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4426.54s)]
*  their self-aware enough to know that they're the religious fanatics. Well, yeah. Yeah. And by the [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4433.66s)]
*  way, sometimes we get too into the rhetorical flourish that we use on the Senate floor. My [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4438.14s)]
*  friend and colleague, the distinguished senator. I don't want to put you in a position to attack [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4443.98s)]
*  your coworkers. Look, relative to not just the founding generation, but pretty much all generations [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4448.86s)]
*  of Americans until very recently, those who are hostile toward Christian beliefs or toward [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4455.259999999999s)]
*  any belief system when it comes to somebody's worthiness to serve in government, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4464.94s)]
*  that's historically aberrational. That's extreme. And it's culturally also throughout most of our [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4470.54s)]
*  history, we have been a religious nation. We are still a religious nation. In fact, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4479.66s)]
*  yeah, I don't think you get away with saying the person's too Jewish for me. I don't think that [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4485.0199999999995s)]
*  would work. Exactly. Exactly. So how the hell do you get away with saying something like that? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4488.46s)]
*  I really don't know. Other than that the media won't go after you. Because they share the view. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4492.62s)]
*  If the media shares that view, which in many cases they do. Now, a friend, mentor, and church [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4499.18s)]
*  leader of mine, a guy named Neil Maxwell died a few years ago. I had this great line that stuck [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4505.1s)]
*  with me over the years. He said, if India is the world's most religious nation and Sweden [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4511.1s)]
*  is the world's least religious nation, then America can adequately be described as a nation [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4517.18s)]
*  of Indians governed by Swedes. Sometimes those in our government don't necessarily reflect the [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4523.82s)]
*  religious beliefs and the religious sensitivities of the people as a whole. And that's one of the [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4529.179999999999s)]
*  many reasons why I often differentiate between America, the country, and the United States [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4533.74s)]
*  government. They are two different things. It's one of the reasons why I bristle every time when [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4543.0199999999995s)]
*  anyone of either party refers to the president of the United States or to Congress as quote, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4547.34s)]
*  unquote, running the country. We don't run the country. The president of the United States [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4553.5s)]
*  certainly doesn't run the country. The president of the United States happens to be the chief [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4557.58s)]
*  executive officer of the United States government and the commander in chief of the US armed forces. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4562.3s)]
*  Runs a large organization with immense power, to be sure. I don't want to denigrate the office. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4567.74s)]
*  But he doesn't run the country. The country itself consists of the American people. He's not running [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4572.54s)]
*  the economy. That's why presidents shouldn't go too far in over promising what they're going to [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4578.94s)]
*  do for the country. I'm going to create this many jobs or to create, to claim credit for jobs that [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4584.94s)]
*  have been created. Presidents can't do that. We've got to get back to a proper understanding [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4589.26s)]
*  of what government is and more importantly, what it isn't. Government's not there to be your rich [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4594.7s)]
*  uncle, your best friend, your fun aunt. It's not there to make everything fair. No, government [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4598.62s)]
*  exists for the purpose of protecting life, liberty and property. Making sure that we don't fall [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4604.38s)]
*  victim to those who would take that which belongs to us or do us harm, either from the inside or the [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4609.9s)]
*  outside. Preserving our freedoms. Preserving our enemies, foreign and domestic. Right, exactly. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4618.62s)]
*  Life, liberty and property. The further afield you get from that Tucker, the more you run into [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4623.5s)]
*  problems. The more removed anything in government is from the protection of life, liberty and [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4629.1s)]
*  property. And within the federal government, it's even narrower. Federal government's job is to [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4634.46s)]
*  protect life, liberty and property in specified, enumerated, limited ways. Immigration, bankruptcy [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4638.94s)]
*  laws, weights and measures, trademarks, copyrights and patents, interstate and foreign trade or [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4644.54s)]
*  commerce and so forth. We've gotten so far afield to that that we've tried to make government the [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4650.22s)]
*  all-powerful, omnipotent, benevolent decider of all things. That is wrong. That's always going to [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4656.22s)]
*  set that government up for failure and it's always going to sow civil discord among the people [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4665.26s)]
*  because we've assigned to government attributes that are incompatible with the mortal human [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4671.02s)]
*  condition. Right. In a world increasingly defined by deception and the total rejection of human [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4676.62s)]
*  dignity, we decided to found the Tucker Carlson Network and we did it with one principle in mind. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4682.62s)]
*  Tell the truth. You have a God-given right to think for yourself. Our work is made possible by [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4688.38s)]
*  our members. So if you want to enjoy an ad-free experience and keep this going, join TCN at [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4695.18s)]
*  tuckercarlson.com. Yes, and one of the hallmarks of a dysfunctional government and an illegitimate [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4701.34s)]
*  democracy, in my opinion, is a leadership class that doesn't represent the people who elected [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4713.02s)]
*  them. So I want to ask you about two specific cases, one in where you work and the other where [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4716.9400000000005s)]
*  you live. So first where you work, the United States Senate. It doesn't seem like the leadership [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4722.46s)]
*  of the Senate, in some cases, Mitch McConnell specifically, doesn't seem like he shares the [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4727.34s)]
*  views of Republican voters, which is a huge legitimacy problem. How did that happen? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4733.5s)]
*  Okay, so first, if Mitch McConnell were here, he would tell you that he does, that he very much is [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4739.74s)]
*  on board with those, and then he would describe all the things that he's done and all the ways in which [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4745.26s)]
*  he really resonates with the words of Ronald Reagan and the objective of limited government [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4749.9800000000005s)]
*  and lower taxes and softer regulations. He'd say all of those things. But Mitch McConnell, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4756.38s)]
*  who's been the Republican leader in the Senate now for a record period of time, going on 18 years, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4763.58s)]
*  a couple centuries since then, at least since the William Howard Taft administration. Yeah, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4770.38s)]
*  war of 1812 in that range. He would say I'm very much on board with all Republican party principles, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4774.46s)]
*  but it misses a few points in that when you're the leader for that long, you've consolidated [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4784.62s)]
*  and taken every opportunity to accumulate power. We've already seen the secretion of power. Remember, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4791.5s)]
*  the only reason why we have the Constitution, the only reason for any Constitution is to limit [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4796.7s)]
*  government. And the purpose of our US Constitution in particular is to protect the American people, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4801.5s)]
*  protect their life, liberty and property by preventing the protecting against the [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4807.5s)]
*  excessive accumulation of government power in the hands of the few. So it does these along two axes, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4815.9s)]
*  one vertical, which is federalism, the other horizontal, which is about separation of powers. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4821.26s)]
*  But we've messed with both of those since the late 1930s. Then there's been a corresponding [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4826.94s)]
*  accumulation of power within Congress, within each house of Congress and within each caucus, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4832.78s)]
*  Republican and Democratic of each house of Congress, where there's been an accumulation of [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4838.46s)]
*  power. Now, this is especially poignant and impactful in the United States Senate, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4843.82s)]
*  where the whole thing was designed around the principle of equal representation among the [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4849.34s)]
*  states. It's the one constitutional amendment that is preemptively itself unconstitutional and [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4855.66s)]
*  therefore impossible to bring about. You cannot amend that part of the Constitution that allows [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4861.66s)]
*  and requires equal representation among the states. In theory, you could adopt a constitutional [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4868.78s)]
*  amendment giving every state a different number of representatives, but every state would have to be [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4874.0599999999995s)]
*  equally represented. And our Senate rules reflect that understanding. And our traditions, our [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4879.18s)]
*  precedents reflect that. There isn't a vast distinction under the Senate rules as they're [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4883.98s)]
*  written and as they've historically been applied between any other member and the current minority [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4890.38s)]
*  or majority leader. Under our precedents, even the only technical distinction is that what's called [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4896.22s)]
*  the right of first recognition. If multiple members are seeking recognition at the same time, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4902.06s)]
*  and one of them is the majority leader, then the majority leader gets recognized. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4906.78s)]
*  But we built this up just over the last couple or three decades, started maybe when LBJ was in the [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4911.02s)]
*  Senate. Prior to LBJ, the floor leader, as it was once called, I believe, but the majority minority [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4916.86s)]
*  leader of each party, wasn't that significant. LBJ started building up the position, but it's [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4924.54s)]
*  really blossomed over the last 20 years or so, where they've now got all this power in each caucus [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4930.78s)]
*  built up behind the law firm of Schumer and McConnell, respectively. And so once that happens, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4937.099999999999s)]
*  I call up the firm, the law firm of Schumer, McConnell, Johnson and Jeffries, once they get [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4945.18s)]
*  into that position, if they share this mindset that accumulation of power within their conference, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4949.1s)]
*  within Congress is a good idea, they start to operate as their own constituency, as with the [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4955.740000000001s)]
*  hive mind, particularly on spending bills. So the law firm of Schumer, McConnell, Johnson and [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4962.46s)]
*  Jeffries will get together and they'll figure out what's going to be in the next spending bill. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4967.18s)]
*  They'll release it predictably, foreseeably, with only days, sometimes hours before the [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4971.1s)]
*  expiration of a spending period. It'll be a couple thousand pages long, contain hundreds of earmarks, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4977.740000000001s)]
*  often a lot of things that bear a faint, but distinct resemblance to the home states of [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4985.42s)]
*  members of the firm. Special benefits for this or that state and industries that are popular there. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=4993.580000000001s)]
*  The firm then becomes the proxy, the leader of what I call the unit party. They bring that [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5001.26s)]
*  to the floor. And what happens? These spending bills brought forward with too little time to [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5006.700000000001s)]
*  amend them. They tell members, look, you got to take or leave this. We don't have time to amend it [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5011.1s)]
*  because we've made sure of it. You can vote against it, but if you vote against it and it doesn't pass, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5015.34s)]
*  the government's going to shut down. We will blame you for a shutdown. So we recommend you just vote [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5020.620000000001s)]
*  against it. Now I've done this, voted against it, voted against them basically every time they do [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5025.18s)]
*  this. And on occasion, it's resulted in a shutdown. I've been blamed for shutdowns. It's not pleasant, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5029.74s)]
*  but this is what happens. They become much more about the accumulated power [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5035.66s)]
*  and about maintaining the prerogatives of accumulated leadership. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5040.46s)]
*  It's so infuriating. I mean, you get elected statewide in Utah every six years, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5043.98s)]
*  three times now, I guess. And I don't know, that's not a small thing, right? And then you show up in [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5049.26s)]
*  the Senate and you can't even get a copy of the spending bill like a month out. Like it's so [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5055.66s)]
*  insulting. Right. Right. Doesn't that drive you insane? Absolutely insane. It is the single most frustrating [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5060.22s)]
*  thing. You know, when I was running for the Senate, it was a live matter to be talking about. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5065.34s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi's reference to the Obamacare bill. You got to pass it to find out what's in it. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5070.22s)]
*  I assumed that that was an aberration, that that was unusual. What I found is it's not [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5074.22s)]
*  terribly unusual. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens far more often. But for your own leader to do [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5078.62s)]
*  that to you. Yes. Yes. Exactly. Do you ever say to him, hey, Mitch McConnell, hey, snapping turtle, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5083.02s)]
*  why don't you, why can't I, what are you doing to me? I have, you're more loyal to Chuck Schumer than [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5088.46s)]
*  you are to your own Republican members. What? Lost count of the number of times that I've raised the [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5094.22s)]
*  issue with him and with the conference as a whole with Senate Republicans. And, you know, for the [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5100.540000000001s)]
*  first six years I was in the Senate, we were always told this feature or that feature is not in line [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5108.0599999999995s)]
*  yet. So we're going to have to go along with this, meaning we don't control the majority in the Senate. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5114.219999999999s)]
*  Republicans control only the House and Obama's in the White House. Finally. But once we get more [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5120.299999999999s)]
*  power, everything will be great. Right. And then we got the majority in the Senate and in the House. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5125.419999999999s)]
*  We still had a Democratic president, but a lot of us made the case, well, we're driving the ship now. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5129.66s)]
*  We should be able to write our own bill. Yeah, but the Obama won't say. So finally we get to 2017. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5133.74s)]
*  And I really amped up the discussions internally within the conference and said, all right, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5139.74s)]
*  at this point, from this point forward, the spending bills need to be on the floor. I don't, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5144.86s)]
*  you know, you're supposed to have 12 different spending bills, each according to a different [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5148.38s)]
*  function of government so that not everything can be tied together. And we haven't done it that way [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5152.94s)]
*  in a long time. That'd be ideal. But even if you can't do that, if you want to do it in one bill, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5157.42s)]
*  then you've got to give us at least a few weeks, maybe a month or so to debate it, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5161.74s)]
*  discuss it. And most importantly in the Senate, the opportunity to amend it. Unlimited debate [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5165.179999999999s)]
*  and amendments are supposed to be the norm and historically were the norm in the Senate. That's [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5170.0599999999995s)]
*  collegial and it's how our rules operate. And those rules reflect back what the Constitution [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5174.139999999999s)]
*  contemplates. And we were told, yeah, you'll have an adequate opportunity to do this. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5180.86s)]
*  You'll have, we operated with continuing resolutions more or less for the first year [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5188.62s)]
*  of the Trump administration, just punting the ball forward every couple of months. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5193.82s)]
*  Finally, it wasn't until I think it was March 23rd, 2018, when we were finally at about that [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5197.74s)]
*  point where I knew we would have to pass something, but we had a few weeks left, but there's a [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5206.62s)]
*  Wednesday night, maybe 8.35, 8.36 PM on a Wednesday night. We got this email from [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5213.580000000001s)]
*  our majority leader, colleagues, attached to a spending bill, may come up sometime. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5222.22s)]
*  You ought to become familiar with it. Every alarm bell in me went off right then. I opened the thing [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5229.5s)]
*  up instantly and my heart was pounding thinking, okay, this is our big opportunity. We got to make [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5234.780000000001s)]
*  sure that we're ready for this. To my surprise, this was 2,232 pages long. So I immediately [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5240.14s)]
*  scrambled the jets within my office. I got every available legislative staffer on my team pulling [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5247.740000000001s)]
*  essentially all-nighters because we wanted to make sure we were ready. We had no idea what the [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5255.34s)]
*  schedule would be. I really hoped that as we had been promised, we'd have the opportunity to debate [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5259.820000000001s)]
*  them, discuss them, offer amendments, pull out this or that earmark or special benefits for [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5264.62s)]
*  thoroughbred racehorses or the stewards of Kentucky bourbon or whatever it was. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5269.1s)]
*  Tucker, the House of Representatives passed that bill without a single amendment before lunch [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5276.06s)]
*  the next day. The Senate, despite my protestations, passed it at about three in the morning, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5283.26s)]
*  later that night. It was too late right then to call President Trump. I didn't want to wake him [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5290.9400000000005s)]
*  up so I called him first thing in the morning to advise him to veto it because this was quite [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5296.38s)]
*  contrary to what he thinks is good government. His staff, the White House staff at the time, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5301.1s)]
*  screened out the call. They didn't give him the message until after he had already signed the bill. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5308.06s)]
*  By that time, it was a Friday night. I got on the plane. Friday evening was flying back to Utah, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5312.22s)]
*  maybe half an hour into the flight. I'm in seat 43 Foxtrot, very back of the bus, flying back to Utah. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5317.74s)]
*  It was the one part of the flight where everybody was quiet. My secretary texted me saying, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5325.74s)]
*  the president's trying to reach you. I said, well, I wish he'd called me earlier, but I'm on a plane [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5332.86s)]
*  now. I obviously won't be able to talk to him. I'll be on the ground in maybe four hours. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5338.46s)]
*  Next thing I knew, I saw these Delta flight attendants looking [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5344.139999999999s)]
*  sort of disheveled, walking down the center aisle with a bright neon orange headset with an equally [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5347.179999999999s)]
*  bright neon cord that stretched the entire length of the fuselage of the plane. They walked all the [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5356.78s)]
*  way back to row 43, back to the plane where I was and said, excuse me, we have the White House [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5361.5s)]
*  Situation Room on the phone. The president of the United States would like to speak with you. He was [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5369.339999999999s)]
*  looking at me like, who are you? He brought me back to the galley and he showed me how to work it. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5373.26s)]
*  Push the button when you're ready to talk. I still thought this is an elaborate practical joke, but I [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5378.860000000001s)]
*  got on. Hello, Mr. President. Mike, how are you? Listen, I had to sign it. Congress had left town. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5383.74s)]
*  There was no other way around it. There would have been a shutdown, would have caused all kinds of [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5391.820000000001s)]
*  problems and Congress wasn't there, Mike. And I said, Mr. President, with all due respect, your [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5395.5s)]
*  staff is not shooting straight with you. They're lying to you if they told you that. We were still [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5399.74s)]
*  in town. We still could have done something. We still could have passed a short-term stopgap measure [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5404.94s)]
*  to keep us funded for another 72, 96 hours or perhaps a week or two as we debated and discussed it. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5409.98s)]
*  The connection wasn't stable and cut out a short time later. They sent back a message, okay, he'll [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5421.98s)]
*  call you when you get on the ground. That'll never happen. He's busy. Sure enough, as soon as I landed [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5426.7s)]
*  in Salt Lake City, I hadn't even gotten to the curb yet or to my car before I got a call from him. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5432.38s)]
*  And he wanted to talk. We talked for like an hour and I explained to him what had just happened to [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5437.34s)]
*  him and that it couldn't happen again. I said, if it does happen again, if your staff tricks you into [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5441.34s)]
*  this again and if what I now refer to as the firm does this to you again, I fear what it could do [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5446.86s)]
*  to our base that expects something different out of us. And I fear what could happen in the November [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5454.38s)]
*  2018 midterm elections, we could lose the majority. If we lose the majority, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5460.139999999999s)]
*  as sure as the sun will rise in the east tomorrow, they're going to impeach you. I don't know what [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5465.179999999999s)]
*  for, but they'll make something up. And if that happens, it could really cause problems for you. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5469.42s)]
*  So let's just not do this again. Well, that turned out to be prescient, didn't it? It did. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5475.34s)]
*  It did. It prescient in a way that I had hoped it wouldn't be. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5480.38s)]
*  Can I just ask why would his staff block your message? Why would they want him to sign something [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5485.1s)]
*  like that? Well, the thing about it this way, Tucker, they face a lot of the same pressure [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5492.46s)]
*  that convinces most members of Congress from both political parties to go along with it. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5498.3s)]
*  Nobody wants to be accused of causing a shutdown. But the firm, the firm gets together and decides [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5505.02s)]
*  what is an acceptable bill. What about the total destruction of the United States, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5512.540000000001s)]
*  which this is bringing about? We're bankrupt and that's going to be very obvious. And if we lose [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5515.740000000001s)]
*  our status as issue of the world's reserve currency, which is on its way, well on its way, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5519.9800000000005s)]
*  thanks to some very specific missteps by the Biden administration. Well, we brought Russia [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5526.14s)]
*  into the loving embrace of China. Literally, the second we kicked Russia out of Swift, I was like, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5530.22s)]
*  we're done. The USD is done. I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. But anyway, the point is, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5534.06s)]
*  when that happens, we're going to be impoverished and all the things that we take for granted will [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5538.9400000000005s)]
*  be gone. And the people who signed bills like that and voted for bills like that are responsible. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5543.9800000000005s)]
*  Does anyone in our governing bodies acknowledge that in private? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5550.3s)]
*  We talk about it a lot in private, those who feel like I do. And there are a number of us who do, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5554.54s)]
*  including some who sometimes vote inexplicably for these things. Many of us do talk about it in [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5560.14s)]
*  private. And there's usually some type of general agreement, but it's followed up by sort of a [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5566.860000000001s)]
*  cognitive dissonance. So it's like alcoholism. It's like you wake up hungover. You wouldn't know [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5574.06s)]
*  because you're Mormon, but like those of us who used to drink too much, you wake up on Sunday, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5577.740000000001s)]
*  you're like, I got to stop this shit. This is terrible. Maybe it's like that. Right, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5580.780000000001s)]
*  perhaps it's that. It's like, my wife hates it when I use this term, but it's a biblical term. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5587.82s)]
*  I think it originally came from the book of Isaiah, like a dog to its vomit. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5593.98s)]
*  A dog to its vomit. It refers to what happens when people return to that which is familiar, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5598.379999999999s)]
*  even though it's not necessarily a good thing and maybe a bad thing or a disgusting thing, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5603.0199999999995s)]
*  you do it because it's there. It's the decision before you. And unless you decide in advance, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5609.66s)]
*  I don't always quote Rush lyrics in media interviews, but to quote free will by Rush, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5617.9s)]
*  if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice. That's right. Unless you decide at the [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5625.58s)]
*  outset, I'm not going to vote for something that I have not read or have the opportunity even to [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5630.299999999999s)]
*  read that I have had no opportunity to vet with my staff and get input from constituents. I will [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5637.099999999999s)]
*  vote no every time. In fact, that was a campaign promise that I made from the first time I ran for [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5646.3s)]
*  the Senate, which is the first office I ever ran for the first public office I ever sought in 2010. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5652.46s)]
*  And I've stuck with that. If they don't give me the ability. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5659.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, my ignorance. I didn't realize that you've only run for one office. It was the US [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5663.34s)]
*  Senate. You won. Yes. Never expected by almost anybody to win. That is crazy, actually. I don't [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5667.34s)]
*  think I was challenging a three term incumbent. I remember him very well. And so people were [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5673.58s)]
*  shocked when I won. But anyway, unless you decide in advance, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5678.86s)]
*  to vote for a bill that I haven't had the opportunity to vet. At a minimum, it needs to be [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5685.58s)]
*  something that I'm able to consider with enough time to have a few staff members pour over it and [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5693.0199999999995s)]
*  help advise me on what provision means. What you got to remember, Tucker, these bills that bill back [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5701.9s)]
*  in 2018, March of 2018, 2232 pages long. You have to remember these do not read like a fast pace [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5706.62s)]
*  novel. They're full of cross references. And it takes an army of very well trained people who know [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5715.339999999999s)]
*  what they're doing to recognize where they're going in order to understand it. If you don't [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5723.58s)]
*  have the opportunity to at least meet with your staff and scrutinize this thing and then have the [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5728.14s)]
*  opportunity to amend it, and then have the opportunity to improve it and get feedback from [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5733.660000000001s)]
*  your constituents, you have no business voting for it. But here's what's happening. Here's what is [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5739.660000000001s)]
*  frustrating to me most about the firm and the uniparty that it generally manages. I've explained [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5744.700000000001s)]
*  what the firm is. The uniparty, as I conceive of it, is that apparatus which manifests itself most [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5751.34s)]
*  obviously and frequently in the form of these massive omnibus spending bills, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5759.1s)]
*  that blurs the distinction between the two parties in those areas, which is again most acutely observed [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5767.900000000001s)]
*  in the spending bill context. The firm puts the bill together. The four of them are the only ones [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5774.22s)]
*  who have really seen the whole thing, maybe a couple of appropriators from both houses [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5779.98s)]
*  and their staffs. But most of the members have seen nothing about it. But then when it comes forward, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5784.78s)]
*  something quite consistent usually happens. Most or all Democrats will tend to vote for it. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5792.78s)]
*  And then enough Republicans in both houses will join most or all Democrats in order to get it [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5801.419999999999s)]
*  over the line, to make it look bipartisan, and in the Senate to make sure that it passes the 60 [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5808.22s)]
*  vote cloture standard. Remember, it takes a simple majority to pass legislation typically, but [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5814.54s)]
*  most legislation in order to get to final passage on a simple majority, you first have to satisfy [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5821.1s)]
*  cloture. You have to bring debate to a close, which takes three-fifths or 60 votes to get there. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5826.780000000001s)]
*  And so Republicans end up supplying the difference. So over and over and over again, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5832.139999999999s)]
*  even sometimes we're in the majority. You have spending bills that unite most or all Democrats, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5838.3s)]
*  and then anywhere from 10 or 12 to maybe [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5844.22s)]
*  1920, as many as 25 or so Republicans will join with the Democrats. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5849.42s)]
*  So then I guess what you're saying, the term uniparty, which I use all the time, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5854.7s)]
*  isn't really accurate. It's probably more precise to say you have the Democratic Party, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5858.62s)]
*  which is being served by a lot of powerful Republicans as well. Because this is a, I mean, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5863.5s)]
*  what they're doing is consistent with the values and views of the Democratic Party. It's [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5868.62s)]
*  inconsistent with those of the Republican Party. So Mitch McConnell's working for the Democrats. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5872.379999999999s)]
*  So that's what it looks like to me. Yeah. And insofar as the Democrats tend to want to spend [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5876.54s)]
*  more money than Republicans, I think that is a fair assessment. Yeah, and have more wars. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5882.379999999999s)]
*  Sure. And just the signature aims of the Democratic Party, he's on board with them. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5887.660000000001s)]
*  If they were here, members of the uniparty or members of the firm were here, they would say, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5894.860000000001s)]
*  well, look, but these also had our earmarks in them. He's also had some of our priorities. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5899.660000000001s)]
*  And we had to take the bad to get the good. There are things in here that really help defense in [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5905.9800000000005s)]
*  ways Republicans are all about defense. And we needed to get that. The defense part of it, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5912.54s)]
*  the military industrial complex, and it's a lure. It's the gateway drug for Republicans to join [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5918.14s)]
*  the uniparty. Can you say that one more time? Just, I just want everyone to write who's listening [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5923.42s)]
*  to this. If you've made it this far in the conversation, this is the key. Please write [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5927.66s)]
*  this down and put it on your fridge. The military industrial complex is a highly addictive substance [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5931.1s)]
*  that serves as the gateway drug to progressive spending bills. In other words, they throw in [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5936.46s)]
*  special handouts for the Pentagon and bring in the, you know, I'm pro national defense crowd. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5944.54s)]
*  And that's how they get them to vote for spending bills that help perpetuate the $2 trillion annual [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5953.42s)]
*  deficit. And that's why we're $35 trillion. It's not working. We're not safer at all. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5960.86s)]
*  Our military is not stronger. We can't even do the Houthis, whoever they are. And so it's actually [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5966.38s)]
*  having the opposite as things often do the opposite of the advertised effect. Right. And [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5972.14s)]
*  no one notices that. Does anyone think the military is stronger now? It's got more funding [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5977.42s)]
*  than ever. Is it stronger? Of course it's much weaker. A lot of people think that it's stronger [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5981.5s)]
*  and there are some metrics for that. We've got more sophisticated weaponry than we have in the [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5985.66s)]
*  past. But on the other hand, our end strength seems to be suffering by virtue of the recruiting [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5989.5s)]
*  impairment that this administration has inflicted upon itself. The way they're presenting themselves [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=5997.42s)]
*  or the way they're running the Pentagon to pursue woke ideological agenda items is itself a turnoff [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6003.5s)]
*  to a lot of the target audience. Well, sure. But even just judging by its effects, judging the tree [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6014.06s)]
*  by its fruit, we went to war against the Taliban in 2001. Were they better armed then or now? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6018.62s)]
*  They, meaning the Taliban. The Taliban. They're better armed now. The Houthis, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6026.62s)]
*  most Americans, including me, had not heard the term Houthi five years ago. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6032.78s)]
*  And now they're closing a key shipping lane with childish drones against the US Navy. So that is [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6036.94s)]
*  not success. It's not. And I remember the exact moment in 2015, I was speaking at some event in [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6045.26s)]
*  Iowa when I heard about what was going on in Yemen. And immediately I thought, oh gosh, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6052.62s)]
*  I really hope that we don't get involved in a proxy war here. And we did. And it's now bled [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6057.58s)]
*  into three different presidential administrations. And it has led to Yemen being even more of a [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6067.18s)]
*  leverage point for Iran. Exactly. Being able to arm the Houthis and having incentive to do so. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6075.66s)]
*  This is one of the things that happens when we get involved in proxy wars generally. One of the [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6082.700000000001s)]
*  reasons why, you know, in Federalist 69, Alexander Hamilton comments that one of the distinguishing [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6088.860000000001s)]
*  categories, our model for our government really is based on the British system in many respects. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6095.1s)]
*  We've got a bicameral legislature. We've got a chief executive. But under the British system, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6099.9800000000005s)]
*  as Hamilton points out in Federalist 69, the king, the chief executive, have the ability to [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6105.900000000001s)]
*  take the country to war independently, unilaterally. The Constitution, by contrast, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6111.26s)]
*  requires a declaration of war by Congress. Now, we never passed an AUMF or a declaration of war [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6118.7s)]
*  with regard to Yemen. They regard all kinds of other existing authorities from the 01 and 02 AUMFs [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6126.3s)]
*  to inherent Article 2 power in the presidency. It's all unpersuasive in my mind. But to authorize [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6132.94s)]
*  all this. So I've been opposing this ever since 2015, because I believed that this was first and [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6139.5s)]
*  foremost about benefiting the military industrial complex and that it would tend to be one of these [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6143.9s)]
*  entangling affairs that gradually escalated. And it's been exactly that. It's interesting. I've [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6151.179999999999s)]
*  found some unlikely allies on that. Here's a picture from a couple of years ago of me and [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6157.66s)]
*  Bernie Sanders arm in arm just after passing one of the first successful efforts at using the [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6163.339999999999s)]
*  War Powers Resolution to get us uninvolved in the conflict in Yemen. He was vetoed and we weren't [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6169.74s)]
*  able to override the veto at the end of the day. But that's how we get involved. And we get involved [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6179.74s)]
*  by degrees. And they've redefined what war is to the point now where, in effect, the executive branch [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6185.5s)]
*  has the ability to get away with fighting war without anyone ever authorizing it or declaring [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6192.0599999999995s)]
*  it in Congress. Because we've redefined what war is. I just wonder, without again calling any of [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6197.34s)]
*  your colleagues out by name, but I know a lot of them, super nice people, some impressive people, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6204.62s)]
*  you know, varying degrees, but there's definitely some smart people in the Senate on both sides. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6210.3s)]
*  But do they ever just stop to say the effects of what we're voting for are not good? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6215.34s)]
*  Are fiscal situations really dire? The military that we fund is not achieving the desired outcomes? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6222.54s)]
*  Do they ever like look at the results? Sometimes, yes. But you gotta understand one feature, Tucker. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6230.0599999999995s)]
*  The military issues are to us kind of, it's our own microcosm of what progressives experience [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6238.38s)]
*  everywhere else. So for Republicans, we regard, Republicans, far too many have concluded that [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6248.14s)]
*  this is conservative. Like, making sure that we have a military strong enough and foreign policy [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6255.26s)]
*  dedicated enough to ensure that the world is safe for democracy generally. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6262.14s)]
*  And transgenderist, because that's what it's put. Do they ever pay, like, do they know what the [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6266.54s)]
*  State Department does? Republicans don't like that part, but they like the making the world safe for [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6270.06s)]
*  democracy and they like the so-called rules-based international order in effect, more or less, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6274.46s)]
*  since the end of World War II. They love that stuff. And so you'll actually find Republicans, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6280.06s)]
*  without realizing it, parroting the same reasoning as progressives generally. Progressives generally, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6285.02s)]
*  when the particular government program doesn't work, their instinct is always to say, we just [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6290.94s)]
*  didn't give it quite enough fuel. If we had just given a little bit more money, more resources, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6295.58s)]
*  if we had invested more in it, then it will work. Communism is a great idea. It just hasn't been [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6300.86s)]
*  tried correctly. Right. It hasn't been tried. We got to do it a little bit more. Okay. So they're [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6304.94s)]
*  all about the, I mean, I'm not going to lecture, but just one question. So like the rules-based [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6308.46s)]
*  order thing, I couldn't be more for rules-based order. I think all orderly people are for rules-based [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6312.7s)]
*  order. I used to live in a country that had one, but the rules-based order advocates supported [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6317.0199999999995s)]
*  the theft of billions of dollars in personal property of the so-called Russian oligarchs, [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6323.74s)]
*  many of whom opposed Putin, had nothing to do with the invasion of Ukraine, zero. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6328.62s)]
*  And we sat back and allowed the Biden administration to steal all their stuff [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6333.18s)]
*  because they had Russian last names. That's not the rules-based order, that's theft. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6336.3s)]
*  That's right. That's right. And we've delegitimized the very rules-based international order that we [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6339.82s)]
*  claimed to be protecting. Made everybody cynical about the American project. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6345.5s)]
*  And in the meantime, we have really presented the first major threat that you and I have seen in [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6349.82s)]
*  our lifetimes to the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. Because in all of this, we've [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6355.02s)]
*  driven Russia and in some ways, Iran into the loving embrace of China. And you now have- [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6365.18s)]
*  Turkey, the Gulf States, Malaysia, like the parts of the world that are getting richer [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6374.14s)]
*  and stronger are fleeing from us. That's not good. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6380.3s)]
*  I know a guy who is a lawyer who works in the petroleum industry. And he's the guy who handles [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6383.5s)]
*  all the legal implications of the contracts, the rapidly developing contracts that are written when [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6390.62s)]
*  there's a petroleum supertanker traveling. He irons out the details of how things are going to be [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6395.9800000000005s)]
*  denominated. He, this is like 20 years ago, he was explaining to me that these are all, no matter [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6402.7s)]
*  where you are in the world, these are pretty much transacted in US dollars. That's just one of the [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6407.1s)]
*  unifying forces behind it. That's starting to not be the case anymore. And that's very chilling [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6413.02s)]
*  because we've all benefited from that to a very significant degree. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6419.02s)]
*  Our prosperity hangs on it. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6422.9400000000005s)]
*  So in the name of protecting the rules-based international order, we've weakened it. In the [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6424.700000000001s)]
*  name of maintaining economic and military security for the United States, we've made ourselves more [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6433.58s)]
*  vulnerable. And so one has to ask at what point will the American people, and more importantly, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6439.5s)]
*  their elected representatives in Congress get wise enough to say, we've been listening to the [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6447.0199999999995s)]
*  wrong voices. We've got to stop deferring to the military experts who will always have incentive [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6451.82s)]
*  to tell us that they need more. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6459.5s)]
*  Yeah, Liz Cheney and Toria Nuland don't know what they're talking about. Okay, so speaking of curious ironies, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6460.7s)]
*  my last question, I think about this all the time, but I'm not an expert. You are. And it's about your [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6466.0599999999995s)]
*  state, Utah, which is an amazing place, lovely place. Most conservative state was always thought to be [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6470.94s)]
*  just because of its population, heavily LDS, inherently conservative people, prosperous, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6477.42s)]
*  family-oriented, just great in my opinion. How did a state like Utah wind up with a governor [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6483.74s)]
*  and lieutenant governor who were just like open out of the closet liberals? Like, what is that? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6490.94s)]
*  Right. Let me speak broadly. I mean, I don't know that I would characterize them the way you did, [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6499.34s)]
*  but I understand the point that you're making. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6506.38s)]
*  Well, that's just the way it looks to me from afar. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6507.42s)]
*  But first of all, while I believe that the people in my state, the state of Utah, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6509.66s)]
*  I think we're one of the most conservative states. I think we're naturally skeptical of government. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6515.58s)]
*  Yep. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6520.46s)]
*  We're naturally inclined to respect the constitution and understand the need for [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6521.58s)]
*  limitations on power. We're actually the only faith that I'm aware of that has as a matter of [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6525.5s)]
*  doctrinal belief, the fact that the US constitution was written by wise men raised up by God to that [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6530.780000000001s)]
*  very purpose. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6535.26s)]
*  But they're also more constitutional. Just as an observer of Mormons my whole life, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6536.7s)]
*  there's not a basic level they're conservative. Like they believe in sobriety and faithfulness. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6540.94s)]
*  They don't like debt. Working hard is like a precept of the religion, it seems. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6545.099999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6549.66s)]
*  On the most basic level, they're conservative. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6551.5s)]
*  Yes. So getting back to the Neil A. Maxwell quote that I gave you a minute ago [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6553.42s)]
*  about America being an object of the nation of India. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6559.5s)]
*  India led by Sweden. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6562.139999999999s)]
*  Governed by Swedes. Utah for being one of the most conservative states, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6563.1s)]
*  culturally, economically, historically, we have no conservative media establishment to speak of. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6568.780000000001s)]
*  Sure, we've got some great people on radio station or two who provide competing voices, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6576.06s)]
*  but as far as our two statewide print media outlets, Deseret News and the Salt Lake Tribune, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6582.14s)]
*  both very liberal. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6588.38s)]
*  How can the Deseret News, which I think was always owned by the LDS Church, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6589.660000000001s)]
*  is it still? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6592.78s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6593.66s)]
*  Well, how does that work? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6594.62s)]
*  Well, the Deseret News seems to be defining deviancy downward, defining how it is in [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6595.82s)]
*  reference to where the Salt Lake Tribune goes. And as the Salt Lake Tribune has moved further [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6604.139999999999s)]
*  and further to the left, the Deseret News, from my vantage point, is more or less [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6608.62s)]
*  tracked with it and gotten by by saying, look, we're not as bad as they are. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6614.78s)]
*  We're the conservative ones. And in many respects, they still maintain elements of [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6618.86s)]
*  conservatism. They are conservative in the sense that they will always advocate the benefits of [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6623.259999999999s)]
*  rule of law. They're not going to call for the defunding of the police. They are pro-religion, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6632.0599999999995s)]
*  pro-God, pro-family, and that sort of thing. And so, in that respect, they're able to portray [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6637.9s)]
*  themselves and I think genuinely view themselves as Utah's more conservative paper. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6646.14s)]
*  But they ignore the fact that outside of those areas, we're consistent with the Deseret News [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6652.54s)]
*  ownership and also the ownership of the broadcast media entity that is also owned by the Church, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6660.3s)]
*  KSL. Even though they are themselves defenders of religion, of families, and of some conservative [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6667.1s)]
*  values, they're run by the journalistic profession, the guild, so to speak. And the guild, as you know, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6677.26s)]
*  journalists by and large are liberal. Now, there are a lot of professions that are like that. My [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6686.700000000001s)]
*  profession, I'm a lawyer. Lawyers lean left also. But I'm not aware of any profession that leans [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6692.54s)]
*  more consistently to the left than journalists. And so, these journalists maybe still see themselves [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6699.1s)]
*  as the more conservative paper, but in their heart, in their writing, in their broadcast messaging, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6707.66s)]
*  they lean left, at least far to the left of where most of Utah's population goes. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6713.98s)]
*  Spencer Cox, really? Your governor? Well, he just seems, again, you know him, it's your state. I don't [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6719.26s)]
*  know him, but just looking at it, it's like that guy should be governor of Vermont or California [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6727.34s)]
*  or New Jersey or some sort of failed state like that. Why Utah? [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6735.0199999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't put him in that category, certainly. But there are those who have concerns with him. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6739.34s)]
*  There are certainly policy decisions that he's made that I haven't agreed with. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6746.62s)]
*  But I think what you're getting at is that sometimes, Utahns tend to elect people who, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6752.0599999999995s)]
*  when they're first elected, speak more like conservatives and then behave a little bit [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6759.34s)]
*  less like conservatives over time. And some of this goes back to this point that, while we are [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6764.38s)]
*  a conservative state, we have no conservative media establishment to speak of other than the, [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6769.98s)]
*  small cadre of very effective radio personalities. But the print media statewide and the statewide [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6776.3s)]
*  broadcast entities, radio and television, lean pretty consistently to the left. And that has an [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6784.0599999999995s)]
*  impact. So too, we've got a lot of universities in Utah, about 10 of them. And they, like most [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6790.78s)]
*  academic institutions, have tended to lean left. Now, not as far left as what you see at Harvard [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6799.179999999999s)]
*  and Princeton and, frankly, most universities in America, but definitely much farther left than [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6805.5s)]
*  they used to be and much farther left than most Utahns are. Those things are having an effect. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6812.78s)]
*  And it's causing problems. It does cause me concern. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6818.14s)]
*  You want to hear my theory? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6821.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6822.94s)]
*  I think Utah is too nice and has been too nice for too long. And the people who live there, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6823.5s)]
*  I say this as a native Californian, so I saw this happen. They've lost sight of the central truth [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6827.9s)]
*  in life, which is it takes a long time to build something functional and beautiful. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6832.22s)]
*  And it can be destroyed very, very quickly, very quickly. California, obviously the greatest state [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6836.860000000001s)]
*  this country ever produced. And now it's in some ways the worst. And it happened in a generation [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6840.780000000001s)]
*  of my lifetime. And I just don't think the people of Utah understand how quickly their state could [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6847.1s)]
*  become a slum. California has become a slum. And that could happen because, you know, you're like, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6852.860000000001s)]
*  you're comfortable, you're prosperous. You're like, you know, we've been too mean, like putting [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6860.22s)]
*  people in prison for rape. Like maybe we shouldn't do that. Like, and you don't understand that the [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6864.62s)]
*  second you allow disorder, slovenliness, debt, like you, the whole thing can disappear in 10 years. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6869.34s)]
*  Right. And in a place like Utah, where the Republican party has been dominant, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6879.02s)]
*  dominant for most of my lifetime, not all of it, but most of it, there is sometimes an assumption [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6883.66s)]
*  that if they're Republican, they are going to do conservative things. Now, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6889.58s)]
*  in the meantime, there are a lot of people who will push agenda items that are themselves very [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6895.26s)]
*  carefully disguised, progressive dream pieces. For example, there was a voter initiative pushed [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6902.38s)]
*  through a few years ago that tried to take away some of the redistricting, legislative redistricting [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6910.78s)]
*  authority from the Utah legislature and put it in an independent, bipartisan or nonpartisan [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6918.22s)]
*  commission. You see where this is going. I mean, anytime you put it in the hands of unelected, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6923.5s)]
*  unaccountable experts, the way this thing works, particularly in conservative state, is going to [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6927.900000000001s)]
*  move you further to the left. So it passed. It's one of the reasons I'm not a big fan of voter [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6933.02s)]
*  initiatives. We've got a Republican form of government. We shouldn't dilute it with these. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6939.18s)]
*  These, you've got the legislatures for a reason. I think it's better to have them do it. But [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6944.3s)]
*  regardless, it's allowed under our state constitution. It passed. Well, our legislature as [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6949.18s)]
*  well, it needed to modified what they did so as to keep the legislature more or less, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6955.58s)]
*  you know, still in charge of the ultimate product. Our Utah Supreme Court, five members on it, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6962.62s)]
*  all five of those members have been appointed by Republican governors and confirmed by our Utah [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6968.62s)]
*  State Senate, Republican dominant for many decades. All five of them recently agreed that the [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6975.66s)]
*  legislature's modification of the original redistricting reform was unconstitutional [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6984.78s)]
*  under our state constitution. This is how we get brought into a progressive system, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6993.34s)]
*  bit by bit by bit, by the appeal of the allure of the scientific expertise and the use of the [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=6998.54s)]
*  left's touch words like the partisan gerrymandering and the rigged legislative districts. It's the [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7008.54s)]
*  whole point. Since the founding, it's been understood that this is how it works. The [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7014.7s)]
*  legislative body alone can make this law. Utah is successful and conservative because of its [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7019.18s)]
*  population. This is my view. It's the dominant religion in the state, is in my view, inherently [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7027.66s)]
*  conservative in a non-political, non-partisan way, but just work hard, don't accrue debt, stay [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7033.66s)]
*  married. There were some people who said when California began to collapse, you guys need to [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7039.58s)]
*  build a wall on your western border to keep the Californians out. You didn't do that. I think it [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7045.58s)]
*  was a mistake. But now that you've been flooded with Californians, is there any discussion of [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7050.0599999999995s)]
*  instituting a probationary period before you let them vote? You come to our state from your [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7055.66s)]
*  failed state. It's almost like we import criminals from Venezuela. You can't vote right away. Why do [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7060.7s)]
*  you allow Californians to vote right away when they come to Utah? Why not a cooling off period [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7065.9s)]
*  of a couple decades? Yeah, I don't know that constitutionally we could get away with that [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7069.9s)]
*  much, but the contours of that have not been entirely clear. But generally speaking, there [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7074.62s)]
*  is an understanding under the constitution that US citizenship means that you can move from one state [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7079.5s)]
*  to another. I know, but it's California. You're moving literally from West LA to Salt Lake and [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7084.62s)]
*  you get to bring your values with you. That can't be good. Some of that happens, but some of it has [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7091.5s)]
*  been surprising. Now, I was last re-elected just a year and a half, closer to two years ago now, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7095.9s)]
*  and we did a lot of polling during that debate, during that campaign and that election process. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7101.74s)]
*  And when we drilled down on the cross tabs and we evaluated those who had moved in from out of [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7109.26s)]
*  state, including a whole lot who had moved in from California, we were shocked at how conservative [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7114.38s)]
*  they were. Many, if not most of them, were more conservative, more supportive of me than a lot of [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7121.0199999999995s)]
*  people who had lived in Utah for many decades. So they were like Cuban exiles then? Yeah, I think [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7131.42s)]
*  the birds of a feather flock together. And if you've seen the failures of California [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7136.94s)]
*  and you see that some of those failures, some of those problems are related to the fact that [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7142.86s)]
*  California has been intoxicated by the progressive lies, the false promises of a progressive nirvana, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7149.26s)]
*  you're not necessarily going to choose Utah as your next place to live if what you're seeking [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7160.78s)]
*  is another progressive nirvana. And so they tend to be self-selecting. They're voting with their feet [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7165.82s)]
*  and those who choose to go to, obviously there are exceptions, but by and large those who have [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7172.0599999999995s)]
*  chosen to move to Utah from California recently, I believe lean more conservative, even more [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7177.5s)]
*  conservative than they do in Utah. I hope that's right, because you've seen in a bunch of other [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7183.58s)]
*  places, Jackson, Wyoming, for example, Dallas, people who leave California, liberals, because [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7186.62s)]
*  honestly they hate diversity. That's part of it. They want to live in a whiter place. That's just [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7194.62s)]
*  a fact. I know some of them. They moved to Bozeman. Funny how that works, right? Well, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7198.38s)]
*  it should be illegal, by the way. You vote to defund the police, you should be required to [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7203.9s)]
*  live in Oakland for the rest of your life. But then they do, they come with their creepy white [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7207.74s)]
*  guilt, their terrible attitudes about government, just their decadent nihilist views. That does [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7213.82s)]
*  happen. Yeah, it does. And it reminds me, have you ever read a book called The Naked Communist? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7222.219999999999s)]
*  No. I read this recently. So it was written by a guy named Cleon Skousen. A famous guy, yeah. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7229.98s)]
*  A friend of my wife's family and he was actually at our wedding. I didn't even know until our [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7235.42s)]
*  wedding day that they were- Mark Skousen's father. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Mark Skousen's father. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7240.7s)]
*  Great man, as is Mark. I somehow didn't realize my wife's family was really close to Cleon Skousen [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7245.98s)]
*  until our wedding day. He introduced himself to me in the temple just before our ceremony [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7251.98s)]
*  started. And I was like, wow, the Cleon Skousen is here. I was asked recently by the Skousen family [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7256.7s)]
*  to speak at a gathering of Cleon Skousen fans and family members honoring his life. And in preparation [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7261.74s)]
*  for that, I read one of his books that I hadn't previously read. I've read a bunch of his other [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7269.82s)]
*  books. But I read The Naked Communist, a book that he wrote, I think first back in the 50s and then [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7273.099999999999s)]
*  continued to update it periodically until around the time of his death. But he outlines the plan [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7281.42s)]
*  by which those who wanted a more progressive form of government were influenced by Marxist philosophy [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7290.78s)]
*  generally and wanted to sort of inculcate a lot of that into the United States. I think we underestimate [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7300.78s)]
*  as Americans the extent to which we have been marinating in progressive messaging, which has [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7309.179999999999s)]
*  elements of Marxist philosophy built into it from the time we could crawl, from the time we entered [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7315.42s)]
*  kindergarten, whether you went to public school or private school, even many religious schools. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7320.62s)]
*  And regardless of whether you were where you attended university, unless you went to Hillsdale [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7325.419999999999s)]
*  or a couple of other places, more likely than not, you received a lot of conditioning with [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7330.219999999999s)]
*  progressive ideology, so much so that we almost don't have adequate language as part of our lexicon [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7337.82s)]
*  to communicate the true purpose and function of government. And I think that's how we end up with [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7345.419999999999s)]
*  this mess where we're $35 trillion in debt, adding to it at a rate of $2 trillion a year [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7350.22s)]
*  with no plan to get out of it because we've bought lock, stock and barrel this idea that government's [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7355.58s)]
*  job, the federal government's job is open-ended, it's there to right all the wrongs, to make [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7360.38s)]
*  everything fair, and that's all a big lie. And that's how we get stuck in it. But if we can [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7365.58s)]
*  reinvigorate this idea that the Constitution and the limited government it guarantees us is our [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7372.3s)]
*  birthright and that liberty is good, that government expands only the expense of individual [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7379.66s)]
*  liberty will be better off. We've got a real opportunity with this election. People love to [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7383.42s)]
*  say every time this year's election is critically important. I think this one is especially an [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7387.9s)]
*  especially important inflection point. In addition to the presidential election, we've got one of the [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7393.34s)]
*  most liberal, progressive and frankly lawless presidential administrations in US history. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7398.22s)]
*  The Senate's on the line. I think Republicans have a real shot at recapturing the majority. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7404.94s)]
*  That's happening at the same time when our current Senate Republican leader, who's in his 18th year, [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7409.34s)]
*  world record in the Senate for either party, is going to be stepping down as leader. We'll have [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7417.66s)]
*  the chance to elect somebody else. And I hope, I expect, I'm pushing, messaging to my colleagues [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7424.46s)]
*  constantly, let's focus, before we get to the who, let's focus on the what. Let's talk about what it [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7432.46s)]
*  is that we envision for this position. We want somebody who will foster and promote the kind of [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7437.74s)]
*  atmosphere in which individual members and the states they represent, their respective voters, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7444.46s)]
*  can have a voice because that voice has been narrowed. It's been narrowed to a very small [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7450.3s)]
*  choke point and it has not inured to the benefit of the American people. And it's frankly one of [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7455.34s)]
*  the reasons why we're $35 trillion in debt. Well, I just really, really hope that you're [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7460.46s)]
*  driving the reforms. I know you will be. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, thank you for spending all this [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7467.18s)]
*  time. Thank you, Doug. So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. I know. Shocking that in [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7471.42s)]
*  an election year with everything at stake, Google would be putting its thumb on the scale and [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7483.26s)]
*  preventing you from hearing anything that the people in charge don't want you to hear. But [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7488.7s)]
*  it turns out it's happening. So what can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it, [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7493.82s)]
*  but that's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7497.34s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that's true. It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7501.82s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7507.82s)]
*  and you'll have a much higher chance of hearing what we say. And we hope you will. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYS3YAoBELo&t=7513.099999999999s)]
