# Marjorie Taylor Greene: AIPAC, NYC’s Future Mayor, and the Warmongers Trying to Undermine Trump
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw)
*  What happened to you Marjorie Taylor Greene? I was reliably informed that you were a right-wing extremist and now I'm hearing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=0.0s)]
*  From Mark Levin and others that you're a liberal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what they're saying [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=8.8s)]
*  So so you've gotten pretty liberal [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=11.24s)]
*  No, no, no, no, not one bit [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=14.96s)]
*  But you are saying things that I've never heard you say before. Of course, we're in a different moment [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=18.64s)]
*  We're in a moment where you know a lot of things that I'll speak for myself [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Zero interest in ever talking about got kind of forced [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=27.939999999999998s)]
*  on us [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  Because of the wild unbridled aggression of a few ideologues in Washington kind of like you just can't avoid the topic, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=34.18s)]
*  So you are Republicans serving in the house [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=42.1s)]
*  Really the only issue that all Republicans in the house agree on is that Israel is a priority over the United States [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=46.7s)]
*  Absolutely, they all agree and but you're now saying that you don't think that's true [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=54.02s)]
*  No, as a matter of fact, I'm sticking to the campaign promises that I've made from the beginning. Yes, America first [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=57.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I've said the entire time [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=64.66s)]
*  And you meant it I guess I [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=67.86s)]
*  Unapologetically mean it. Yeah, and apparently that's shocking [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=70.7s)]
*  This is so interesting Tucker since I've become a member of Congress since 2021 we have voted on 22 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=83.14s)]
*  resolutions for Israel 22 of them all kinds of resolutions, you know denouncing anti-Semitism [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=91.1s)]
*  Supporting Israel. We voted on 22 of those [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=98.58s)]
*  And we voted on 22 of them [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=101.86s)]
*  And we voted on 22 of them [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=104.5s)]
*  You know denouncing anti-Semitism [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=107.14s)]
*  Supporting Israel we voted on 22 of those [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=110.06s)]
*  we never vote on resolutions proclaiming great things about America or [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=113.06s)]
*  Defending certain Americans or defending Americans in general, but we have voted on 22 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=118.7s)]
*  resolutions in the house [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=124.62s)]
*  Defending Israel how many of you voted yes on I [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=126.3s)]
*  don't know my [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=129.62s)]
*  exact record the last one I [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=131.18s)]
*  Voted no on and then the one before that I voted present because I just started getting sick of it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=134.06s)]
*  Well, that's kind of it. I mean, I never really I've always noticed this certainly in the last [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=138.74s)]
*  I don't know how many years it's been a while where Republicans in the Congress are you know, always talking about Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=143.82s)]
*  I'm not against Israel. I've always liked Israel. So I don't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=148.78s)]
*  Haven't really noticed it. Okay, fine, you know love Israel love any country, you know, whatever but it feels like something [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  Has changed like why and clearly it has for you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=159.34s)]
*  What is that thing? Well, I think here's a situation [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=162.82s)]
*  It's coming to a point where it's so obvious all the time and everyone's language the social media posts [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=166.82s)]
*  They put out the statements that they make they have to proclaim Israel [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=172.94s)]
*  They have to proclaim their their faith and loyalty and Israel and how they you know [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=177.38s)]
*  Israel is our greatest ally and it's a statement that has to be made over and over and over again to the point [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=182.42s)]
*  It's becoming like wait a minute. What about our own country? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=188.18s)]
*  What about our own country? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=191.62s)]
*  What about our own people and we have so many problems here in America and we talk about this all the time [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=193.06s)]
*  37 trillion dollars in debt just like you and I were speaking before our kids generations [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=198.66s)]
*  My kids are 22 25 and 27 and our children's generation. They can't afford rent. They can't afford to buy a house [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=203.78s)]
*  They can't afford insurance. They can't buy a new car. They can't find a good paying job [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=211.5s)]
*  They're living month to month paycheck to paycheck [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=215.74s)]
*  Credit card bills stacked up and they literally look to the future going [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  How am I ever going to realize the American dream and it seems hopeless for them? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=222.22s)]
*  but then in Congress everyone is chasing and pursuing and proclaiming their loyalty to a foreign country and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=226.78s)]
*  My goodness, I have nothing against Israel. I wish them well. I wish the people of Israel well [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=234.9s)]
*  I wish Jewish people well, but I also wish every country well and I want good things for everyone [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=240.26s)]
*  So why do you hate Israel so much? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=246.04s)]
*  I hate Israel [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=248.22s)]
*  Right. Yeah, but you know, here's what it is. I compare it to it's like white guilt [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=250.22s)]
*  You know, we've dealt with white guilt for so many years and and it's it's it worked [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=254.58s)]
*  Has it improved anyone's life? No [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=261.8s)]
*  No, and this is a similar thing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=264.02s)]
*  When in reality everyone's lives are going to improve here in our country if we just focus on our own country [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=267.02s)]
*  And it's really simple [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=273.46s)]
*  One of my children just graduated college I was talking to her this morning over coffee [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=275.78s)]
*  She's got 13 friends. She's moving to a major American city with and I know of course I know them all I know them [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=280.34s)]
*  You know for her four years in college great great people [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  three have jobs [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  Very yeah three out of 13 [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's it's not it's like a real college [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=295.82s)]
*  You know pretty good college and pretty smart kids hard to get into for sure [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, three out of three out of 13 and most of them are from, you know, well-to-do family [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  They'll be fine darkest dark death or anything. But like that's not that's not good. No, it's ridiculous [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=308.18s)]
*  yeah, we are literally failing our children, yeah, and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=313.74s)]
*  It's unacceptable and it's opening the door for so many bad things in America [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  It's opening the door for Americans turning to voices and turning to leaders that they should never pay attention to exactly and I'm [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=324.06s)]
*  It disgusts me. Honestly, I'll I turned a corner this past weekend where I'd had it [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=332.97999999999996s)]
*  I've I have been in four years [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  My first four years was under the Biden administration and so everything I blamed on Democrats [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=341.38s)]
*  Exactly, and I was absolutely repulsed and disgusted to what happened to our country over four years [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=346.62s)]
*  Just like everyone else shocked angry and disgusted me too. And obviously that's why we won in November [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=352.5s)]
*  Oh my goodness, it was a miracle [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=359.42s)]
*  I mean people poured out from all walks of life all [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=361.5s)]
*  Backgrounds and came out and voted for Trump voted for Republicans in the house Republicans in the Senate [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  So we've been in power for six months and and I was so excited in the beginning thinking there's nothing we can't do [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=371.06s)]
*  literally nothing we can't do but six months in there's literally nothing that we can do and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=379.1s)]
*  Then we ended up bombing a foreign country and that upset me so much and and I'm allowed to be upset about it [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=384.9s)]
*  I can stand here and say you are allowed. Well, no, I'm not sure if not according to Mark Levin and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  Not according to many others, you know that that prioritize another country over our country [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=398.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's interesting you said a second ago that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=405.3s)]
*  When people are really frustrated when they're the system they live under fails them they listen to voices that they shouldn't [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  Listen to or wouldn't listen to under any other circumstance like how did Al Sharpe didn't get to be the leader of black America [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  Whatever. I mean, it's like just it's a thing desperate people [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=420.22s)]
*  Tend to go to crappy leaders I think and I just can't get over what happened in our biggest city this week the very same [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=423.62s)]
*  Week that everybody in DC is focused thousands of miles away on the greatest threat we face Iran's nuclear program [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=431.1s)]
*  I want Ron to have the bomb. I'm not pro-roman. No, we're not pro-roman. Yeah, like why do we have to say it? No, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=436.32000000000005s)]
*  It's it's done. But at the same time that everybody was looking [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=443.12s)]
*  to Iran our largest city had a Democratic primary effectively the mayor's race and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=448.12s)]
*  by 32 year old socialist who wants government-run grocery stores [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=454.68s)]
*  Gets gets like he's gonna likely run our biggest city. Yeah in the country [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=459.44000000000005s)]
*  New York and it's like why did that happen? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  Is it because people are so like desperate for government-run grocery stores or love socialism or love like [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=468.8s)]
*  foreign-born midwits running their cities and probably not [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=474.8s)]
*  That guy was the only person in the New York City mayor's debate to say he wanted to focus on New York City [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=478.76000000000005s)]
*  They were all the candidates were asked if you could visit a foreign country. What would it be and they of course all [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=485.16s)]
*  Had an answer. I think most said Israel great and he said I wouldn't go anywhere [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=489.92s)]
*  I'd stay in New York and like if I want to meet Jewish constituents [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=493.72s)]
*  I go to their synagogues their homes or whatever, but I'd be here in New York because that's what I'm doing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=497.24s)]
*  I'm running New York. That's my job. Well, he gave the right answer gave the right answer [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah gave the right answer at least and he's talking I totally oppose his program. Absolutely [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=504.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think it works, but um, he's talking about economics. Yep, and everyone else is talking about foreign policy [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=510.04s)]
*  Why is it hard to talk about economics domestic economics? I don't know apparently they don't know how to fix it [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=517.76s)]
*  Well, look who he was running against he's looking. I mean the failed mayor Andrew Cuomo. Look at him. He was governor or governor. Yeah [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=523.08s)]
*  Discussing sexual all types of accusations. Yeah [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=532.72s)]
*  So he was he was seen as the dirty [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=537.08s)]

*  They already had him and they still have the same problems. They're still poor. They can't afford life [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=545.36s)]
*  They can't afford to move up in the world. And so they looked at Andrew Cuomo and like why am I gonna vote for him? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=550.32s)]
*  He's not gonna make my life better. And so they look at this [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=555.6400000000001s)]
*  This man who's been in our country for what six years? Yeah six years. So he's foreign-born [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  he's a socialist and he's promising to empty the prisons and do all kinds of crazy things and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=566.12s)]
*  he's talking but he's talking to them on their level and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=573.0s)]
*  Talking about talking about the problems they are facing relating to them with the problems are facing so [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=576.12s)]
*  These young people have no choice but to turn to this like I agree and it's it's it is a failure [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=582.0799999999999s)]
*  It is literally a failure of of the Republican Party [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=587.9599999999999s)]
*  I think the Republican Party has completely failed and it makes me so angry Tucker and I can't you know [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=592.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm not supposed to speak out right? I'm not supposed to have my own opinion [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm supposed to just have blind allegiance to my party and I'm supposed to cheerlead and rah rah rah [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=602.5s)]
*  But that's not why I ran that's not why I ran for Congress in the first place [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  I literally ran because I was mad at Republicans. Yeah, well, I'm still mad at Republicans [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=612.38s)]
*  Because it is affecting our children's lives in future and it's it's our job to hold our elected leaders [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=618.14s)]
*  Accountable. It's my job to hold my colleagues accountable [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=625.74s)]
*  And if we don't fix these problems to the point where young people are turning to crazy socialists [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=628.38s)]
*  It's gonna get worse. It's literally going to get worse in our it'll be gone [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=634.86s)]
*  I don't think we could ever get it back [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=639.5400000000001s)]
*  So you walk into my garage my actual garage. One of the first things you see is a Liberty safe [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=641.62s)]
*  We trust it all my family's guns are in there the guns I inherited the guns. I actually hunt with I [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=646.82s)]
*  Put the things I really care about in a Liberty safe [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=653.34s)]
*  They've got a new pricing program on its Centurion line that makes it easier than ever to afford real protection [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=655.6s)]
*  Which is made in the United States these these safes are actually made here in Payson, Utah [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=661.84s)]
*  skilled American workers make them and they are [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=666.6800000000001s)]
*  Clearly a quality product. They're not that expensive prices start below 600 bucks [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=670.72s)]
*  The Centurion line is the perfect product for first-time buyers [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=676.2s)]
*  It's ideal for protecting your firearms important family documents anything you want to keep safe [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  My guns are right there right now every American deserves access to high quality secure storage without spending money [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  Overseas that's why Liberty is the best Liberty safe comm the whole Centurion line is there keep your family protected [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  You'll be glad you did we are well [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=700.36s)]
*  It's just kind of weird because Fox News tells us that the real threats are abroad or their Iranian sleeper cells in the United States [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=702.0600000000001s)]
*  It seems to me the real threat to the United States is the collapse of its cities of its population centers [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=708.72s)]
*  Where the most people live I don't live in a city don't want to live in a city because they suck. Yeah [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=714.6s)]
*  But in a normal country, I would live in a city and so would you sure of course [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=720.32s)]
*  So I don't understand how we spent the last 25 years fighting all these wars obsessively focused on our enemies abroad [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=725.4000000000001s)]
*  Jihadis or whatever they're telling us the threat is white supremacists under Biden [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=733.2s)]
*  And the country has not gotten better. No, it's like maintaining the Empire has destroyed the Republic. It does feel that way [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=738.36s)]
*  Oh 100% but we have to look at what the struggle we're dealing with [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  So I think it's very interesting to look at the pattern in place. So 2016 [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=749.1600000000001s)]
*  America rose up and I was one of those little people and we rose up and and turned to one man because he was different [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=754.38s)]
*  On a stage of 17 [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=760.88s)]
*  He was 100% different than the other 16 and he spoke our language and cared about issues [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=762.56s)]
*  We were like, oh my gosh, we've never heard a politician say this before [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  So we elected Trump and then then President Trump went into his first administration [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=771.64s)]
*  Totally unaware of what he was getting into. I mean who could know if you're coming from the outside [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=777.4s)]
*  How could you know how that system works? You can't I didn't know and so then President Trump thought hey, everyone's supporting me now [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=782.3599999999999s)]
*  I won I won the election all Republicans should get behind me. We're all going for the same thing [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=790.28s)]
*  But no, they stabbed him in his back people in his administration were horrible [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=796.1800000000001s)]
*  They threw him under the bus allowed him to be investigated and accused of horrible things the people stood with him [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=800.8s)]
*  But we watched the establishment tried to beat him back [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=807.28s)]
*  Then the election was stolen in 2020 then January 6 happened the establishment roared back again and tried to take back the Republican Party [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=810.8s)]
*  Take it back and take control [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=819.48s)]
*  The people didn't let it happen though. The people were like no we are not we do not want to go back to the neocon ways [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=821.6400000000001s)]
*  We don't want to go back to the failures of the leadership of the Republican Party [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=828.12s)]
*  So then we saw what happened. He got more powerful. They were [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=832.8800000000001s)]
*  Prosecuting him. I mean 34 indictments [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=838.36s)]
*  They found him guilty. They tried to kill him twice. They tried they put him in jail [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=841.44s)]
*  Giving him that iconic photo and then we elected him again, but it's the same thing [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=847.12s)]
*  You know what's happened the establishment and the neocons the ones that tell us that they're America first. Oh, we're not we're fake MAGA fake MAGA [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=852.52s)]
*  They're the ones that have figured out how to dress up in in an America first costume and put on a MAGA hat and now they [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=862.04s)]
*  Speak our language perfectly. They have the dialect down [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=868.64s)]
*  They know the lingo and they know how to talk like us but they're not us at all and that I think that's what we saw [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=872.4s)]
*  Happen over the past week when when when we bombed Iran [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=878.68s)]
*  We saw the whole establishment rear its ugly head and it's bigger than we could have imagined [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=884.72s)]
*  And I think it was fully exposed and to me I looked at that and I went wow [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=889.92s)]
*  It's worse than I thought because you want to know something Tucker? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=894.92s)]
*  We only have President Trump for a few more years [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=898.64s)]
*  And in just a few more years [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=902.48s)]
*  we're going to have to elect another president and we're going to all have to turn and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=904.5600000000001s)]
*  Find a new leader that will share our values and fight for them [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=909.24s)]
*  That's gonna be very hard [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=913.5600000000001s)]
*  because we're gonna have to fill shoes that are very big very difficult to feel to fill and [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=915.8s)]
*  We've had President Trump now for all these years and so many people are gonna be disappointed because you're not gonna have another Trump [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=921.48s)]
*  there's not going to be one and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=928.44s)]
*  I think it's the most dangerous time for people like us that truly care about our country [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=930.84s)]
*  Love our children and want to fix the problem so that their lives can be better [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=936.6400000000001s)]
*  And I think we're going to face a real [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=939.9200000000001s)]
*  Fight within our party to make sure that it that we are pushing the focus to focus on America [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=942.6400000000001s)]
*  Focus on our problems and just let the world do its thing. We can have great trade deals [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=949.44s)]
*  We can do all these things [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=954.7600000000001s)]
*  But it's going to be very hard to push that system in place because I really think in the past week I realized [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=956.04s)]
*  That that's not who they are. They said it on the campaign trail [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=963.28s)]
*  They they promised it when they got elected and a whole bunch of others the talking heads on TV [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=967.16s)]
*  They all pretended but in the past week, I was like, nope [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=972.96s)]
*  It's that's it's not real. Yeah, so the question is do the people who really do care about the United States give up and leave [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=977.16s)]
*  You know the party the movement [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=986.04s)]
*  Or not. I mean New York City was built by [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=988.4s)]
*  You know hard-working sober [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=992.28s)]
*  Christian people and they built this amazing city and then of course they all left because it became chaotic [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=995.84s)]
*  Starting in the 60s and they're all gone [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1001.0s)]
*  That's that's why you get the election results you do they just ran away and they move to the suburbs or Montana or wherever [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1003.44s)]
*  They have a tendency [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1011.4s)]
*  Productive people have a tendency to do that. They don't stay in fight. They do like I don't want to deal with this [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1013.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm out. Yeah, they don't have to stay in the fight. Well, that's true. But do you see that happen with? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1017.1999999999999s)]
*  America first do you like in five years people gonna be like, you know when [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1023.36s)]
*  Mark Levin and Laura Loomer built America first with Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, right like [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1027.44s)]
*  The heroes of the movement right like the Soviets redefined the Bolshevik Revolution to make you know Stalin the head of it [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1034.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh totally, you know what I mean? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1040.8799999999999s)]
*  Is America first? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1043.32s)]
*  Except Israel first, but can you is that gonna happen? Do you think that? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1046.36s)]
*  people who [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1051.84s)]
*  Really think that we you know, we need a government that focuses on the country it represents [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1053.56s)]
*  Well, those people stick around and say no, I'm sorry. You can't I don't I can see through your skin suit [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1058.68s)]
*  I know who you are this this is all fake. You can't use my government my military to process, you know to [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1064.36s)]
*  Prosecute these silly sectarian wars anymore, right? I don't know. I'm gonna be really honest. I don't know [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1071.36s)]
*  I think it goes one. They can kick you out. Then I think we'll know the answer. Oh for sure [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1077.0s)]
*  They would love to they're already trying to I've had I had three reporters literally. Was it yesterday? I think it was yesterday three reporters [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1082.3999999999999s)]
*  one from punch bowl one from Axios and [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1090.48s)]
*  one from the Wall Street Journal and [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1095.12s)]
*  I know who they're they're connected to people and they came they came and they were asking me the same stupid questions trying to [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1098.04s)]
*  Make this like she's she's betrayed Trump. She's she's broken up with Trump [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1103.8s)]
*  She's turned her back on him which couldn't be further from the truth [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1108.74s)]
*  But they're setting the stage because they want these headlines, right? So the Wall Street Journal is now kind of looking out for Trump [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1112.48s)]
*  Oh totally. Yeah [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1118.24s)]
*  Enforcing loyalty in the Trump ranks. Yes. Yeah and punch bowl obviously [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1120.96s)]
*  They're very concerned. Yeah, and I don't want to see any leaking or disloyalty against Donald Trump. Those are MAGA publications [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1126.32s)]
*  Let me tell you this is too funny. It's too unbelievable [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1132.82s)]
*  But it's so so you it's so predictable. I know [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1137.44s)]

*  Which was all these people that came out of the woodwork from all all over the place Democrats liberals progressives Republicans [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1751.88s)]

*  That because they're agreeing with me and it was hilarious [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1777.48s)]
*  But they're flooding my office with phone calls agreeing with me and I'm sitting here going. Hey, hey Republicans [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1780.8400000000001s)]
*  Remember we said we weren't going to do this [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1788.88s)]
*  Imagine how much support we could have if we stuck with it like if we actually [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1791.3200000000002s)]
*  Stuck with what we said and actually minute because now there's a lot of people that feel betrayed [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1796.0s)]
*  That we didn't stick with that. I know and and that's not what President Trump wants [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1801.68s)]
*  Absolutely, that's not what he wants, you know, he's in and I have to I have to give him all the praise and credit [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1806.3799999999999s)]
*  He bombed him and then he pulled out [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1812.22s)]
*  Thank God and I loved it when he dropped the f-bomb [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1815.3s)]
*  Talking to the press and he was telling he was like both of them have gone crazy [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1820.1s)]
*  I was so that was I was like inject this in my veins right now [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1824.06s)]
*  This is exactly what I want to hear but it was the two major reactions [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1828.18s)]
*  That that blew my mind absolutely blew my mind I'm not entirely surprised I've seen that [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1833.4199999999998s)]
*  It is a kind of weird feeling to be praised by people you disagree with on everything or think you disagree with it [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1841.1799999999998s)]
*  I who knows I don't know everything is kind of up for grabs. I'm against killing people. Yeah [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1846.1399999999999s)]
*  Innocence, I'm just opposed. I'm totally opposed to abortion [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1851.7s)]
*  Thank you. The nation is one of the worst thing most evil things I can think of I agree and I think wars of choice [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1855.12s)]
*  Are really evil. That's my view. Yep, but what's interesting and I feel that instinctively, but I also feel it [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1862.22s)]
*  Theologically, that's correct. I guess like what do I know, but I feel it [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1870.46s)]
*  but you represent a district in Georgia, that's [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1875.06s)]
*  Very heavily Protestant Christian. I'm Protestant Christian. Mm-hmm [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1878.94s)]
*  And there is a feeling among a lot of Protestant Christians [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1884.02s)]
*  Non main line what we call evangelicals, I guess is the term they use [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1887.9s)]
*  That we have a moral obligation to support the secular [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1892.5s)]
*  government of Israel [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1897.1000000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm that God tells us that we have to fight these wars for the secular government of Israel not for the ancient nation of Israel [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1898.3000000000002s)]
*  the Jewish people secular government that that that supports abortion and [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1904.78s)]
*  and sports LGBTQ and trans and so two questions one [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1910.6200000000001s)]
*  What kind of reaction have you gotten from those voters many of whom are like some of the best people I know I just [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1916.66s)]
*  Want to say they're great. They're great and they're all your fans [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1921.98s)]
*  But what kind of reaction have you gotten from them and second what where does that come from that belief? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1926.7s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I think I'm sure some of them are mad at me right now [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1932.34s)]
*  I'm I can totally expect that and understand it and I'm sure we'll work it out. That's that's something I do know I [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1935.42s)]
*  Don't know where I don't know where it comes from [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1943.9s)]
*  I think to me what I've witnessed just you know, from my opinion it is embedded in our education [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1945.8600000000001s)]
*  System we're taught all these things were of course taught about the Holocaust taught about the nation of Israel [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1952.94s)]
*  It's it's embedded in our education, but it's also embedded in church [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1959.0600000000002s)]
*  It's embedded in church and and they take that verse back in I guess it's Genesis [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1963.7s)]
*  12 Genesis 12 bless those who bless you and and I will curse those who curse you yeah, there's in the I [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1970.06s)]
*  Checked the other day because I had this interesting conversation with Ted Cruz who said his theology was based on that verse [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1976.7s)]
*  He had no idea where in the Bible it was and couldn't describe what really what it meant. That's his theology [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1981.82s)]
*  Try not to be disrespectful [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1988.02s)]
*  Though I have no respect for it. I just want to say but anyway, I looked at the in my Bible [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1989.9s)]
*  I checked two different translations. There's no word Israel in there [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1993.9s)]
*  I don't know quite know. I don't know enough to know what he's really talking about [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1996.3s)]
*  But right but that's very common for kids in Sunday school to be used in Sunday school [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=1999.82s)]
*  And it's used in Bible studies and it's related to the end times. I've done I've done those Bible study groups [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2005.14s)]
*  It is very much tied into revelations and they walk all the way through [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2011.7s)]
*  they tied in with the covenant they tie it in all the way and [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2016.7s)]
*  Look I'm not gonna pretend I'm a Bible scholar. I'm not going to pretend that I know everything as a matter of fact [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2021.02s)]
*  I'll sit way back in the back. I know who I am [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2028.02s)]
*  I know I'm a sinner and I'm not gonna try to tell ever anybody what they should believe but I've read my Bible I [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2030.5800000000002s)]
*  Grew up Catholic and then I didn't like the pedophile priest issue didn't want to raise my children in that [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2037.7s)]
*  So I left the church and I'm just a Christian just a simple Christian and I've read my Bible and the one thing [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2043.5s)]
*  I know is it says a lot of other things in there. It says do not murder. That's pretty important [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2050.82s)]
*  Yeah, someone hits you in the face turn the other cheek if someone takes your cloak, you know, give them the rest your clothes [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2056.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's like but that's from Jesus. So [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2062.06s)]
*  Christians care [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2065.5800000000004s)]
*  Above all what Jesus says I think I do if you're a young person working for a big company [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2067.06s)]
*  You know on some level you're working for the man [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2072.7000000000003s)]
*  You're working for a system that doesn't like you and doesn't help you at all [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2075.02s)]
*  But you got to do it but there is a way to subtly stage a minor revolution in your mouth [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2077.92s)]
*  That's by using this product is not owned by some [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2084.04s)]
*  Horrible company that hates you and is trying to wreck your life [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2087.56s)]
*  It's owned by us and we made this out because it's the single best nicotine pouch in the world [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2090.48s)]

*  How have we gotten to the point where you have sincere Christians who I think I probably agree with on everything [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2125.08s)]
*  And certainly most things who people I love would be delighted to have dinner with I mean no disrespect at all to them [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2130.88s)]
*  but how do we get to a point where good people like that are [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2137.96s)]
*  Making the case that Jesus wants more bombing. I don't what is that? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2142.52s)]
*  Well, also look at Jesus himself who was he was he was persecuted in his lifetime [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2147.88s)]
*  by the leaders of [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2153.72s)]
*  Israel the the leaders at the temple he was he was persecuted by his own people's leaders and [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2156.08s)]
*  That's something to recognize and all of the prophets throughout the Old Testament [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2163.56s)]
*  Who were they persecuted and killed by the leaders of their day? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2167.64s)]
*  It was it's it's throughout the entire Bible. So it's it's not uncommon that this would be happening and [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2172.08s)]
*  Here's what here's what I find interesting. I [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2180.24s)]
*  Don't think [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2183.2400000000002s)]
*  Well America if you've read revelations is not in revelations [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2184.56s)]
*  yeah, and nobody wants to talk about that and [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2189.32s)]
*  We need to say why is America not in revelations and I think we could come up with all kinds of theories [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2192.84s)]
*  But I know for a fact it's not in there because I've read that part too. Yeah [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2198.36s)]
*  I don't think John was aware in his cave on Patmos of the United States of America [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2201.9s)]
*  Well and and and when he was given that entire vision and shown all of that he wasn't shown America [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2207.96s)]
*  so [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2216.1600000000003s)]
*  There's a clear reason we don't know why but I think back to this story is [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2217.2000000000003s)]
*  Americans have been taught that they have to do whatever Israel says and it's the secular government of Israel [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2223.0s)]
*  The secular government should not be telling Christians in America what they should and shouldn't do with their tax dollars [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2230.2400000000002s)]
*  with their military [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2236.8399999999997s)]
*  And with who their allegiance should go to well [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2238.96s)]
*  I got a lecture on Christian theology of the day from David Friedman the former [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2241.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump ambassador to Israel and I was like not against David Friedman seems smart [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2245.6s)]
*  But like seemed a little much to be giving me a lecture about Christian theology. Mm-hmm [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2249.96s)]
*  Well, and also this here's something else we have to recognize with people that are like mad at me or mad at you about saying [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2254.92s)]
*  These things we need to wreck it. They need to think about this too. It's like hey, we all live in this house [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2261.68s)]
*  It's called the United States of America. This is our house and [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2267.08s)]
*  If we are giving our full allegiance to another foreign country who doesn't pay our taxes [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2270.52s)]
*  Will not pay off our debt did not come and defend our southern border when it was invaded for four years straight [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2276.3999999999996s)]
*  When it when its Prime Minister Netanyahu was the first to congratulate Joe Biden [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2282.16s)]
*  Being president of the United States he was the first foreign leader. I don't understand country that has [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2288.56s)]
*  long-standing military ties to China [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2295.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's that which runs the port of Haifa. I don't I mean I'm not attack [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2297.92s)]
*  Look Israel is doing what it thinks it needs to do. I just want to say for the 50th time [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2302.2s)]
*  I'm not especially mad at Israel not mad at [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2305.84s)]
*  Our leaders who don't seem to care about the United States [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2310.04s)]
*  That's it and that's the problem and that's where we are we have this house [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2313.68s)]
*  It's our house the United States of America and our elected leaders are not fully focused on our house and our problem [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2317.7599999999998s)]
*  With our children and their future and that's why we are opening the door wide open [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2324.88s)]
*  to foreigners that have moved to the United States of America and profess insane [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2330.24s)]
*  Socialists and communist views and they are going to get elected. There's another one running against Nancy Pelosi [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2336.56s)]
*  AOC's [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2342.88s)]
*  former campaign manager and and chief of staff and [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2344.3199999999997s)]
*  He sounds just like that mayor in New York and he is he is a Democrat primary in Nancy Pelosi [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2348.08s)]
*  So this whole thing is going to get the left is going to go in a whole nother direction [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2354.44s)]
*  Because Republicans who professed America first are not solving the problems exactly [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  And Republicans refuse to talk about economics like actual economics not bullshit economics GDP and tax cuts [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  But actually like it's too expensive for my kids to buy a house [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2371.36s)]
*  What are you doing about that right and the answer is absolutely nothing other than yelling you're a socialist [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2375.0s)]
*  I'm not insecure about being a socialist. I don't really care [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2381.36s)]
*  What people call me but that is a much bigger problem than anything Iran is cooking up and it's centrifuges as far as I'm concerned [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2385.2400000000002s)]
*  Certainly a bigger problem for everyone. I know my kids can't buy a house therefore. They can't get married to have kids, right? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2393.76s)]
*  So think about this last week our kids were just thinking about I can't afford to buy a house [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2399.7599999999998s)]
*  Where am I gonna get a good job? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2404.96s)]
*  All my friends can't find a good job a lot of young women that are conservative or like where am I gonna find a good man? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2406.44s)]
*  A lot of conservative young men are like where can I find a decent young woman to marry? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2411.96s)]
*  Because many of them are insane have turned left or so far left. Yeah, so last week 37 sexual partners [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2417.16s)]
*  Which sorry people are starting into it, you know, who's into that? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2423.68s)]
*  That it means not I so there's all the but but think about it last week [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2426.8s)]
*  They were thinking about all their other problems that they already have but they weren't thinking about do I have to worry about a terrorist? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2431.8s)]
*  Attack happening here in the United States [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2437.88s)]
*  Fast forward to this week now. It's like oh my gosh [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2440.1600000000003s)]
*  Not only is life unaffordable and all these unknowns and all these problems I have and my credit card debt is my credit cards are [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2443.52s)]
*  Maxed out and I can't go on vacation and I want to go with my friends and I want to go to this concert [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2450.28s)]
*  But I can't afford it [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2455.16s)]
*  But now they have to think about oh if I do go to that concert there could be a terrorist attack [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2455.92s)]
*  Because we bombed Iran. It's like a whole nother a whole nother set of problems [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2460.12s)]
*  Yeah, and so of course when this guy that's running for mayor of New York City [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2465.3599999999997s)]
*  iconic New York City is talking to New Yorkers and he says on the debate stage [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2471.2599999999998s)]
*  When he's asked what foreign country do you want to go visit and the rest of them are saying Israel and he says I don't [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2477.52s)]
*  Want to go I just want to stay here in New York. Of course, they're going to listen to him [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2483.08s)]
*  Yeah, I listen to him and I I don't want to do mayor of New York at all [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2487.7599999999998s)]
*  I I think it's so important that someone responsible and reasonable and American runs, New York [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2491.64s)]
*  but I guess in general I just resent I [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2498.48s)]
*  Resent importing foreign conflicts into our country ancient race hatreds religious ethnic hatreds [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2503.16s)]
*  What does that have to do with us and I feel like we've definitely wholesale imported that I get texts all the time [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2510.12s)]
*  From you know some people I like but you know Pakistani Indian [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2516.0s)]
*  Bangladeshi telling me about some fight in US or Canada but different [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2520.8799999999997s)]
*  Muslim or Hindu groups and I'm not against any of them. I like them all I'm not sure but what does that have to do with? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2526.7999999999997s)]
*  North America [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2532.2799999999997s)]
*  Nothing. It's a why did we other countries don't put up with that you try that in the UAE [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2533.6s)]
*  Yeah, you're some this happened. You're some Pakistani worker [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2538.48s)]
*  Building office buildings in the Gulf and you like have a march through downtown Abu Dhabi saying I'm you know, I'm mad at India [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2542.8s)]
*  They're like you're out on the first flight [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2550.4s)]
*  Back to Lahore burning their flag. Yeah, nothing personal [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2554.28s)]
*  Yeah, if they're out if you're out there burning their Indian flag, I'd love to see what happens to you [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2557.92s)]
*  Yeah, well they I mean the attitude of the Emirati government is that is nothing to do [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2562.1600000000003s)]
*  Don't bring that shit here right even if we're on your side. I mean, you know what I mean, right? Yes 100% [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2568.2s)]
*  Yeah, but okay. So in Congress we have I think it's 32 members of Congress are foreign-born [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2575.2799999999997s)]
*  Not born in the United States really 32 [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2582.56s)]
*  I serve with them [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2586.68s)]
*  32 I was surprised to learn that Ted Cruz is not American. He's like a secret Canadian [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2588.72s)]
*  He's from Canada not Texas [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2595.08s)]
*  Yeah, so Canada does it border Texas? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2598.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't think so not on the map. I [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2602.0s)]
*  So what is it I've been I'm it feels weird even to ask you because I've spent so many decades [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2605.7999999999997s)]
*  Studiously ignoring this issue. I don't want to engage. I think it's weird [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2613.08s)]
*  It's always bothered me, but I don't want to talk about it because I don't want to fight about it [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2617.16s)]
*  But it's been pushed you can't ignore it and you brought it up. What why? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2621.8399999999997s)]
*  Are almost every single every single Republican I'm aware of other than you and maybe Massey is like in this [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2627.08s)]
*  Weird kind of Israel worship mode all the time and many Democrats by the way Pelosi [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2634.72s)]
*  chief among them [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2640.24s)]
*  when when [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2641.7599999999998s)]
*  So when a candidate when some a candidate steps forward and they're running for Congress they get approached by all kinds of groups all the [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2643.24s)]
*  special-issue groups everything from pro-life groups to pro-gun groups to [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2649.36s)]
*  Christian groups and there's a group called a pack and they come to and so everybody [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2655.18s)]
*  They'll have a form a survey form for you to fill out each group has a survey form [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2662.64s)]
*  Because they want to know where you are on the issues, which I think is a good thing [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2666.6s)]
*  I think Second Amendment groups need to know hey, are you gonna take away my gun rights? I [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2670.08s)]
*  Think that's the right thing to be asking candidates pro-life groups [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2674.7599999999998s)]
*  Are you gonna go to Washington and vote to kill babies like we want to know who you are? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2678.8799999999997s)]
*  I think that's great. Well, there's a group called a pack and [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2682.88s)]
*  They come and they want to know what's your position on Israel and they want you to write a paper and they want to know [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2686.8s)]
*  They want to fill you out on your position on Israel [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2692.8s)]
*  And then if you get elected to Congress if you win your race everyone's freshman year a pack will take [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2695.2000000000003s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats new members on a special trip to Israel. Do they pay for it? I [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2703.32s)]
*  Don't know. I don't know because they didn't take me [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2709.96s)]
*  They didn't take me. You're the only one in your class who didn't go [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2713.04s)]
*  I think I'm the only one in my class that did not get invited. I didn't even get invited [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2715.76s)]
*  It wasn't that I turned it down. I didn't even get invited and I'm not anti-semitic [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2721.52s)]
*  I have again. I wish Israel the best. I wish them all the best [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2726.32s)]
*  I wish everybody the best but they didn't take me on the trip. I do too [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2731.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but they didn't take me on the trip [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2735.6s)]
*  So I don't know if it's they pay for it, but I should find that out because I think that's important [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2738.4s)]
*  But here's the situation and I it's it can't be ignored and I have no problem talking about it [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2743.64s)]
*  I think any special interest group if they are representing another country a foreign country [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2748.88s)]
*  They have to register that way [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2755.76s)]
*  Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act Farah, we have a law. Yes, they should register under that law and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2758.44s)]
*  I think and their Americans are members of a pack their members they donate to it sure [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2765.52s)]
*  But if you're still an American and you were representing this the interest of any foreign country [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2772.2s)]
*  You still have to run Manafort's in American. He's from Connecticut [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2778.48s)]
*  He's from like Meriden, Connecticut or something Weathersfield, Connecticut. He's from Connecticut. Mm-hmm, and he was [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2783.32s)]
*  Convicted as an American for not registering as a foreign agent as a foreign lobbyist [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2789.52s)]
*  So, I mean the argument that it's Americans doing the lobbying [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2795.12s)]
*  That's the point Americans who are lobbying on behalf of foreign country have to register doesn't mean they can't lobby [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2798.7599999999998s)]
*  It's just it's fair to have them register. Yes [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2804.12s)]
*  So why isn't a pack? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2807.2799999999997s)]
*  Regist why aren't they registered under Farah? I don't understand that I think everybody's too afraid to push that issue [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2811.2s)]
*  Why I [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2817.96s)]
*  Have no idea [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2819.4s)]
*  Because that is I think it's because it's such a strong group that will come against you. They will come against you [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2821.2000000000003s)]
*  They will fund a primary against you [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2826.92s)]
*  I'll probably get a primary funded against me for even saying this on this show [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2829.48s)]
*  But you know what? I don't care. I think you were getting one anyway [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2833.36s)]
*  I'm probably getting one and that's fine and my district can vote for whoever they want to represent them [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2839.8s)]
*  They can it's just funny it's like you and Massey are the only member and the whole class Republicans the majority of the House of Representatives [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2845.78s)]
*  Mm-hmm majority of 435. Yeah both sides [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2853.94s)]
*  Well 535 with the Senate, I still think you and Massey are the only ones who've ever said anything like this [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2858.04s)]
*  Probably oh, I'm sure I'm sure we're the only ones we're not the only ones that think it but we're the only ones that say it [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2863.18s)]
*  So that's my next question. It's not anti-semitic to say it. Well, obviously that's [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2870.1s)]
*  I had a group coming to me and and saying we really want to make sure that you're voting to fund [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2875.02s)]
*  3.3 billion dollars, you know every single year to whatever Switzerland exactly [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2882.66s)]
*  That would be the same thing. I love Switzerland. I have ancestors who came from Switzerland and [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2890.74s)]
*  I go a lot. It's just an amazing country. I couldn't support it more. I wish Switzerland well as I wish Israel well [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2896.46s)]
*  But if there were maybe there is a Swiss lobby I [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2903.3s)]
*  Would it is I'm sure there is [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2908.0600000000004s)]
*  Right, I'm not they don't need the help I guess but I would neither is Israel really but I would expect [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2912.02s)]
*  Them to register under the law [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2918.6600000000003s)]
*  And I wouldn't be an anti-Swiss bigot. No for saying otherwise [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2921.38s)]
*  So I don't really want to play along but I'm wondering this is all so very obvious and so rational and so [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2925.5400000000004s)]
*  So relevant right now. Mm-hmm [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2933.78s)]
*  Does anybody ever mention this in the Congress you've been there for a while? No, they have their blind faith and loyalty [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2937.1800000000003s)]
*  Blind faith and loyalty and they're scared to say it. What about the guy who showed up in a foreign military uniform? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2944.46s)]
*  Zelensky well, there's that [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2952.7400000000002s)]
*  They worship by the way, I just want to be clear. It's it's not just Israel that they worship [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2954.7400000000002s)]
*  They worship him oh my goodness they worship him that's a clear but you should see the propaganda [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2959.38s)]
*  I could go for days on that one [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2965.5s)]
*  I say, you know [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2966.8s)]
*  I went hard against that war that war started and and it wasn't a month after that war started and we had [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2967.82s)]
*  Ukrainian soldiers and their uniforms injured Ukrainian soldiers on crutches fitting uniforms [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2975.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of this is limping through the halls of Congress going and visiting our offices [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2981.58s)]
*  Begging for help we need help [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2987.42s)]
*  Hitler is going to come and take our country and steamroll across Europe Vladimir Putin [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2990.42s)]
*  But that's what they that was the thing [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2995.5s)]
*  But so we get you with the propaganda that comes through the halls of Congress is incredible. It's incredible [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=2997.78s)]
*  But do you ever sit in the you know in the house and ever have someone say [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3005.58s)]
*  We're voting on our 22nd Israel resolution like it's a lot. Actually [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3011.9s)]
*  I did finally but does anybody ever say again? No, we have a country to 350 million people live here [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3016.18s)]
*  No, no one ever says that no, so Nancy Mase is like she's just excited to vote for another [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3023.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes, so it's not just everyone talks about a pack. I've already said I think they should of course [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3029.7s)]
*  They should register under fair. It's a foreign lobby. It's common sense not attacking him [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3035.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not even saying anything bad about them. They just should be it's insulting [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3038.8199999999997s)]
*  They can continue that everyone's afraid to say that you shouldn't be afraid no, but it's not just there's something like what is this? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3042.54s)]
*  This I think is the weirdest thing Brian Mast shows up in an IDF uniform in the Congress. I don't know Brian Mast [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3049.66s)]
*  I'm sure he's a delightful person but like [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3056.26s)]
*  Are you allowed to show up in a foreign military? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3058.9s)]
*  Uniform in the Congress. I don't think it's I I don't it's like waving a foreign flag on the floor [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3062.14s)]

*  How it's serving in a foreign military. That's pretty serious [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3086.18s)]
*  Giving your you swear an oath and you swear your allegiance to fight and die for that country [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3089.62s)]
*  You're saying I'm willing to die for this country, but then you can serve in our countries I [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3094.96s)]

*  I have no plans [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3109.12s)]
*  Don't want to but if I did I think people would say fairly like how can you be an American said don't you forfeit? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3112.44s)]
*  Your citizenship by doing that people would say it definitely would go [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3119.6s)]
*  Go to jail for it. Yeah, the New York Post [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3124.1600000000003s)]

*  Why can you watch one on TV and you can't watch the other one on TV and I don't know the answer to that [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3256.48s)]

*  It's because they learn English and Spanish in their schools as they're growing up [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3430.0s)]
*  The customer service was the best customer service [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3434.56s)]
*  I have had in decades and I customer service is one of the things I'm really picky about because I grew up in a [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3438.1200000000003s)]

*  That's ridiculous and it's widely accepted and it's common practice and no one ever questions it. So now you are questioning it [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3527.56s)]
*  Without hate I think [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3536.9599999999996s)]
*  And you said like five times you're not mad at Israel. You're mad at American leaders who refuse to [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3540.2799999999997s)]
*  Put their own country first, which I think is fair, right? But um, I mean you're gonna get crushed for saying this probably [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3546.04s)]
*  What do you think's gonna happen? Well, I think I don't know but I'm sure they're going to try to find a primary [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3553.08s)]
*  Against me. Yeah that won't say the things that I say [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3560.3999999999996s)]
*  Yes, and they're going to try to say that I'm betraying Trump when I'm not at all [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3564.6s)]
*  I have spent millions of my own dollars campaigning for that man all over the country [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3569.28s)]
*  Like freely just going just with him the other day. Yes. I saw you with him somewhere at the White House [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3575.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, like I you cannot make me not look I love him [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3580.88s)]
*  I think he's great and I support him and I think he did a great job [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3584.96s)]
*  I think it was incredible that our military was so well trained the strikes that they made and then President Trump said enough [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3589.24s)]
*  And he backed out of it [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3597.6s)]
*  No other president would have done that and the Congress is upset that he backed out and Mark Levin's head is going to explode [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3599.68s)]
*  Well, actually I have the quote and I hate to beat up on Mark Levin. He's got enough problems, obviously [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3607.12s)]
*  But so the moment the ceasefire happened. He said this I hate this word ceasefire [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3612.88s)]
*  I really do [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3618.28s)]
*  so how could I mean [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3620.2000000000003s)]
*  That's so I do think it you know your worldview what you're like as a person what you love what you hate like that [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3622.48s)]
*  It is important. And if you hate the word ceasefire. Mm-hmm. I hate the word like [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3627.52s)]
*  dead children [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3633.6800000000003s)]
*  We're killing that's ceasefire. That's the word you hate haven't you I mean that Wow, that's right a heavy thing to say [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3635.44s)]
*  Yes, so Mark Levin that is attacking you every hour on his ex account here and attacking me and calling me names [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3642.96s)]
*  And and Fox News is tolerating that by the way, of course [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3651.16s)]
*  Which is I think atrocious and pathetic any other company by the way [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3654.6800000000003s)]
*  any other company would never allow their employees to go on their own personal social media and [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3658.76s)]
*  Like verbally berate and attack and call names to people [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3665.76s)]
*  That's a fireable offense in the real world and private in the private sector [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3670.16s)]
*  No company allows their employees to do that Fox News is allowing Mark Levin. You can't fire Mark Levin [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3674.0s)]
*  He's got such a huge audience. Oh wait. No nobody nobody voluntarily [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3679.16s)]
*  watches Mark Levin, of course, I [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3684.24s)]
*  Don't know anybody that watches Mark Levin. I'm sure someone watches it but you know, he's the great one apparently [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3686.7999999999997s)]
*  but no, seriously though, it's it's [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3693.64s)]
*  The fact that he hates the word ceasefire [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3696.72s)]
*  Is an attack on the president that's a real attack on the president not the words that I'm saying [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3700.16s)]
*  Not anything that I've said not when I said we shouldn't be doing this that wasn't an attack on the president [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3706.0s)]
*  That's going exactly with what President Trump campaigned on [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3711.8399999999997s)]
*  Now what Mark Levin is saying that he hates the word ceasefire. That is his attack on President Trump [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3716.08s)]
*  That's him putting the ultimate disapproval hate on what President Trump [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3723.3599999999997s)]
*  Has done and that we are all so thankful and happy for peace is the ultimate [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3729.1200000000003s)]
*  Thing that we should pursue at all times peace at all times because it's good for every every country and every single people [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3734.92s)]
*  But Mark Levin hates it. Well peace is also the purest expression of strength [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3742.4s)]
*  And I'm not and I'm not you know [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3748.84s)]
*  Resurrecting the horriest quote of all peace through strength from Reagan, you know, there's truth in that but peace is a byproduct of strength [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3751.4s)]
*  When you have a strong father in the home, you've got strong parents the kids get along. Mm-hmm [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3758.84s)]
*  You got some, you know, flaky Xanax head running the house. Yeah, the kids are out of control. There's chaos. There's fighting [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3763.26s)]
*  That's right. Like strength brings peace. Yeah dad's home knock that shit off. We love that [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3769.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but it's but that's just true. That's it. Yes principle that never changes right? So [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3776.04s)]
*  It's just funny that there are people I just can't get past it [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3782.92s)]
*  I think it's important to say it because like you want your country to be good that you want its leaders to be good [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3786.88s)]
*  You don't always have to agree with them [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3791.94s)]
*  But if their main goal is to kill people if they if you don't have any problem [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3793.6s)]
*  Watching Randy Fine who's a member of Congress? I guess from Florida elected barely got elected by the way in a very red district [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3799.96s)]

*  Disgusting but um [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3815.3199999999997s)]
*  Somebody sent him a picture of like a literally of a dead child and he's like, that's great. Oh my goodness [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3817.24s)]
*  That's the most horrible thing ever [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3822.2s)]
*  But how can someone like that serve in the Congress? I have no idea they shouldn't be in God is he worshipping? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3824.44s)]
*  He's not talking about God not my God. What God wants that? Nope. I nobody no God [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3830.12s)]

*  So you I mean if I'm if I'm whatever that guy's name is Mike Johnson [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3842.72s)]

*  But if you put a symbol of like hate and violence and killing children on your Twitter feed [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3906.08s)]
*  The people who run your party would say something about it, right? Oh, well, I got I got kicked out of [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3911.2000000000003s)]
*  Totally removed from all committees [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3919.6s)]
*  For things that I had put on social media or shared before I ever became a member of congress [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3922.08s)]
*  But you weren't espousing violence. Were you no I was not espousing any type of violence [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3928.56s)]

*  But how many followers does anybody even know he posted it? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3976.16s)]

*  Ordinance before it goes and kills people celebrating murder, especially of the most innocent [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3993.5s)]
*  I'm i'm pretty sure that that's in the bible too. Then there's very dark things. Yeah [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=3999.44s)]
*  I mean you can be an atheist and oppose that it's just it's so obviously [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4004.48s)]
*  Repulsive and I just think Republicans [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4007.98s)]

*  pretty consistently, um [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4017.52s)]
*  for 40 years [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4020.0s)]
*  I think [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4021.52s)]
*  I think it's bad for the I hate to use word brand but like I think it's terrible for the brand [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4023.92s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what the election was all about [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4029.04s)]
*  No more foreign wars. No more regime change [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4032.4s)]
*  No, the the 13 soldiers that were killed in the afghanistan withdrawal that [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4036.08s)]
*  Devastated the country. I mean, I think that was like the nail in the coffin [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4042.3799999999997s)]
*  I think so it was and we're still devastated over it [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4046.48s)]
*  And those poor families and all the and there's you know [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4049.9199999999996s)]

*  Oh, I know we we talk about the 13 but there were so many horribly injured that are living with that today [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4057.3599999999997s)]
*  That was the nail in the coffin [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4062.88s)]
*  and to return back to it where our party is cheerleading it and and [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4065.84s)]
*  Apparently sharing the dead bodies of children and celebrating that and celebrating dropping bombs. It's it's like [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4071.76s)]
*  I'm not [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4080.6400000000003s)]
*  Attacking president trump because I believe he did what he thinks is right and how he's handled it is exactly what I want from him [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4081.6800000000003s)]
*  He has done it better than anybody [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4089.44s)]
*  but the the the party itself [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4092.48s)]
*  And all of the talking heads whether it's on the internet and on television how they reacted was repulsive to me [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4095.76s)]
*  Because they shouldn't have been like yeah, we're going after them [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4103.84s)]
*  It should have been like hey [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4107.52s)]
*  Remember what happened to these 13 soldiers and their families and these other soldiers? Well, there should at least be some solemnity [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4108.72s)]
*  It's a big thing to kill people. It's a big thing to drop a bomb. I mean, maybe you think you need to do it [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4114.72s)]
*  I'm [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4119.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not always right. I'm often wrong. So maybe i'm wrong [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4120.48s)]
*  well, but even if i'm [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4123.92s)]
*  Even if i'm wrong, you still shouldn't be gleeful when you drop a bomb on people. What kind of freak are you anyway? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4126.0s)]
*  No, I think that's horrible. It it no no one should celebrate that [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4132.48s)]
*  now if here's here's what we can say is [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4137.04s)]
*  If the mission was successful and they really destroyed the nuclear program then we can be really proud of our military [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4141.36s)]
*  That is incredible and we can be proud of the the men and women that carried out that successful mission [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4148.16s)]
*  And we can be thankful for our president for keeping our country safe [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4154.72s)]
*  If you know we can go along and say all these things are true [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4158.400000000001s)]
*  But at the same time when president trump [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4161.76s)]
*  I mean and he went in hard and said it's time for a ceasefire. It's time for peace [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4165.360000000001s)]
*  But yet we have mark levin over there [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4171.52s)]
*  Pissed off on his radio show and he's saying I hate the word ceasefire like that is that is disgusting [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4174.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's not who we are. That is not our movement. That is not america first [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4182.400000000001s)]
*  That is not magga as a matter of fact, he took off the costume [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4186.4800000000005s)]
*  Temporarily because he couldn't take it anymore. It was stifling. It was hot [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4191.02s)]
*  He was sweaty [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4195.84s)]
*  You know, you can see the whole thing is getting moist under the skin suit very much and he ripped it off [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4198.08s)]
*  And he admitted who he was again. I hate the word ceasefire [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4203.28s)]
*  And so I think it exposed so many people [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4207.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's really sick [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4212.16s)]
*  Really sick too visual. I know it's too visual. It's just better like [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4214.4s)]

*  Mark levin no and regular people don't behave that way as a matter of fact [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4247.92s)]
*  Regular people don't they're they're so again back to being like, okay. We have all these problems [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4252.32s)]

*  My wife's car is broken down. I can't afford to buy her a new one. I mean these are real problems [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4270.900000000001s)]
*  This is the stuff that fox news should be talking about and mark levin should be talking about and cnn should be talking about [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4276.66s)]
*  And elected leaders most of all should we should only be talking about that I know that's because my job title is [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4283.379999999999s)]
*  representative [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4291.04s)]
*  In the united states house of representatives. That's that's our job title [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4292.259999999999s)]
*  Somebody said to me the other day. I don't know if you I mean you are an elected representative [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4296.74s)]
*  So you have a much better sense of polling and where the public is but someone said to me yesterday [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4300.74s)]
*  The reason this push is coming now when there was no [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4305.78s)]
*  I don't know there's no actual evidence that they were days away, but whatever i'm glad I don't want them to have a bomb [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4309.78s)]
*  So no, we don't want them to have a but why now? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4315.0599999999995s)]
*  So steve witkoff wonderful man was on his way to aman [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4318.339999999999s)]
*  um [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4322.5s)]
*  on sunday [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4323.7s)]
*  last sunday and on friday [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4325.54s)]
*  Bombing started is real sort of bombing [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4328.419999999999s)]
*  They didn't ask they just announced that they were doing it and they did it and derailed the the talks, of course [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4331.139999999999s)]
*  But why the urgency and someone said to me the other day [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4336.74s)]
*  It has to do with the polling on this question and the only people who support this kind of lunacy are [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4340.26s)]
*  in mark levin's [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4346.66s)]
*  Demographic age demographic like it's older people young our parents generation the baby boomers [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4349.12s)]
*  I hate to say that everyone beats up on the boomers, but it's well deserved if we're being honest [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4354.18s)]
*  really selfish selfish generation in general, but [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4358.58s)]
*  Do you sense that like anyone under 40 is for this stuff? Oh my gosh, no no [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4361.54s)]
*  Baby boomers get their primarily get their news from television [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4368.5s)]
*  Yes, the republican baby boomers watch fox news the republic. I mean the democrat baby boomers. They watch cnn [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4372.42s)]

*  that's where they get their news and that's where they receive all the [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4381.46s)]
*  Propaganda fed into their head about what they should think what they should believe who they should support [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4385.7s)]
*  How they should vote [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4393.3s)]
*  When they should protest what who they need to be mad at it's it's all there on television television for them [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4394.98s)]

*  So you don't know any 28 year olds who are like yeah [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4425.46s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program is the biggest threat we face and we need to affect regime change if necessary [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4428.26s)]

*  Tucker [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4467.3s)]
*  In the next 10 years or maybe a little bit longer the baby our parents generation is going to pass away [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4468.42s)]
*  and by the time that entire generation is has moved on and and the bulk of it sadly has passed because that's my mom and [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4476.58s)]
*  was my dad and [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4484.42s)]
*  when they're gone [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4486.18s)]
*  and that mentality and those [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4487.9400000000005s)]
*  You know [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4490.740000000001s)]
*  Decisions made in washington based on all of this [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4492.740000000001s)]
*  neo-con and fighting for foreign countries and fighting the foreign causes and sending the foreign aid and all of this foreign garbage [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4496.96s)]
*  once they're gone [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4504.900000000001s)]
*  we're going to be [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4506.820000000001s)]
*  Decimated and desolate because we will have never poured back into our own country [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4508.660000000001s)]
*  Yes, and then we're going to have our generation of kids who at that time are going to be like in their 30s [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4514.74s)]
*  It's going to be really hard for them [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4520.82s)]
*  I totally agree and so that generation will be gone and mark levin won't get to affect put his opinion on anybody [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4522.18s)]
*  And it won't matter anymore [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4528.66s)]
*  And I don't even know if people will watch tv anymore. Who knows? No, they're going to be sick of it [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4530.58s)]
*  I mean, I think they're already sick of it people are checking out [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4536.26s)]
*  We're going to get radical politics [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4539.78s)]
*  But I think it's going to be before 10 years [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4542.34s)]
*  When I was a kid, I went with my dad to venezuela to caracas and um, it was probably the late 70s [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4545.54s)]
*  Great town great city. It was a you know, biggest oil reserves in the world was rich country beautiful super nice people [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4551.78s)]
*  Beautiful women, you know, this is great caracas venezuela was great [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4559.54s)]
*  The economy of venezuela was always pretty centralized basically came down to like a very small number of families controlled everything [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4563.46s)]
*  Which is fine unless you marry that to democracy you give everyone a vote [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4570.66s)]
*  So you can only have an economy [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4576.82s)]
*  that's [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4579.46s)]
*  Pyramid shaped right if you don't give everyone [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4580.5599999999995s)]
*  The vote but the second you give everyone the vote you better share the wealth [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4584.74s)]
*  Or just shut it down and make it an oligarchy [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4589.62s)]
*  But you can't have those two together. So they had those two together [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4592.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they elected a marxist [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4595.54s)]
*  Um [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4598.26s)]
*  Who you know and all those rich people who were there when I was in caracas are now living in south florida and of course [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4599.7s)]
*  You know paying politicians to hate maduro or whatever, but but the point is it's not even about chavez or maduro [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4605.94s)]
*  it's like they were the products of [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4611.54s)]
*  A society that couldn't sustain a middle class, right? [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4614.98s)]
*  And that's going to happen to us. It's already happening [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4619.14s)]
*  It's already happening I wrote a whole book about this that nobody read a number of years ago because it was so obvious that it was [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4622.9s)]

*  The state of georgia is very similar and the democrats know it [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4819.4s)]
*  But the republicans are not paying attention to how important georgia is georgia is the economic hub of the south [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4823.5599999999995s)]

*  They are not serious about defeating democrats in this next election [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4850.92s)]
*  It feels like they are on autopilot and they are snoozing but when the democrats take the state of georgia [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4855.08s)]
*  They will it's it's impactful. It's impactful on our economy and it's a power structure [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=4861.799999999999s)]

*  Yeah, like as if [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5056.360000000001s)]
*  It's like we just won the election in november [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5058.76s)]
*  So it's still same that same kind of vibe because democrats democrats are so lost right now [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5061.0s)]
*  They don't even know who they are. You know, it's it's that non-stop conversation [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5066.68s)]
*  Because they're seeing them go out and fight ice and they're seeing them do these no king protests [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5071.18s)]

*  and the republicans [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5085.9800000000005s)]
*  Cannot win elections if they don't understand what the enemy is doing and how they're rebuilding and the direction that they're going in [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5088.7s)]
*  And they're harnessing rage real rage [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5095.74s)]
*  I don't think it's aimed necessarily at trump, but there's real rage about the decay in the country. Yes abandoning [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5099.18s)]
*  Young people that's the whole reason everyone voted for president trump. No, that's why he won young people [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5106.06s)]

*  But if republicans don't deliver them [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5118.46s)]

*  I i'm like I feel the same way [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5131.42s)]
*  Maybe we should just move oil prices up to 100 bucks a barrel because we're having another war in the middle east like that [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5133.179999999999s)]

*  spiking the global oil price like that because [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5169.96s)]

*  Percentage of them that agree with me, but they don't want to say it. They won't say it out loud. It's too risky [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5336.92s)]
*  Or they perceive it to be too risky because they don't want to be called anti-semitic. That's the label [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5343.5s)]
*  It's it's like it once you get called that label you get all these nasty articles written about you [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5349.98s)]

*  Horrible thing that happened to all these innocent people in israel and it happened on his watch [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5387.8s)]

*  Way more popular [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5410.7s)]
*  And it's not anti-semitic to say that there was a vote on thursday [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5412.62s)]
*  Last thursday that he barely won by two votes [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5417.98s)]

*  And they've tried to do it to me before and everybody that knows me knows knows that is not true about me [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5483.580000000001s)]

*  I'm getting to the point where I almost don't care about the two parties anymore [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5741.3s)]
*  Yeah, i've just like i'm like why would I be loyal to one? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5744.5s)]
*  And I definitely disagree with the other one [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5748.34s)]
*  But if we can find a place to actually like you're talking about [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5750.82s)]
*  Care about the economy and care about our children's ability to have a future and raise a family [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5755.3s)]
*  Then I don't care. I don't care who I have to work with [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5761.46s)]
*  It's just getting to the point where that is so [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5764.259999999999s)]
*  Fundamentally important and nothing else should matter [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5767.12s)]
*  I couldn't agree more [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5770.42s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor green, thank you for spending all this time and and good luck because you will definitely [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5772.66s)]
*  You will definitely i'm gonna need it. You're gonna make the daily beast mad. I'm just telling you that [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5777.0599999999995s)]
*  You are you are they may not even endorse you [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5782.58s)]
*  Darn it. I don't read them. So I don't care. Thank you. Thank you [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5786.099999999999s)]
*  So it turns out that youtube is suppressing this show on one level that's not surprising that's what they do [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5794.0199999999995s)]
*  But on another level it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now all the change taking place in our economy [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5799.7s)]
*  And our politics with the wars won the cusp of fighting right now [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5805.94s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information rather than more and that is totally wrong. It's immoral [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5809.94s)]
*  What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5817.7s)]
*  We're not in charge of google or we could find a way around it a way that you could actually get information that is true [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5821.78s)]
*  Not intentionally deceptive the way to do that on youtube [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5827.46s)]
*  We think it's to subscribe to our channel subscribe hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er4NEwVLXw&t=5830.82s)]
