*  Of here, right? We cannot trust the you know the whole system with our child [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=398.68s)]
*  They could they could steal him from us right this could happen. I don't want to be the the test case for that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=404.40000000000003s)]

*  This is it's not a place where I can raise my children and I'm thinking like long term [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=424.22s)]
*  Right, we yeah, we've been in this place for six generations, but and it's a wonderful town, you know [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=430.72s)]
*  Amazing place. I mean it's home. I love the people there and you know, many of them are gonna be watching this and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=438.0s)]
*  Well, you must know all of them [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=444.52000000000004s)]

*  My wife and children hated when I would go to the store because it would take you know an hour to get a thing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=451.04s)]
*  Of milk because I just stop and talk to people I've known my whole life [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=457.3s)]
*  Oh, I love that and it's a wonderful play like it's hard to leave that right because it's you know [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=460.72s)]
*  It you're familiar with everything and all the people and just the the way of life [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=466.12s)]
*  And that's just where your family's buried six generations. That's just I had no idea [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=471.42s)]
*  That's so much to give up. It must have been but I can't like it would it I can't stay in a place like that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=476.7s)]
*  It's [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=483.86s)]
*  There's no future for for my children for my family in a place that's that far gone [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=485.1s)]
*  Right that that has been destroyed and and you see so many of these other states, you know, California Washington adopted all the same things [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=490.66s)]
*  That that walls is Minnesota did why? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=497.26s)]
*  I want to get back to the Ridge Runner and the town that's being built [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=501.38s)]
*  Which I assume is a fascist Christian theocracy. That's what the the TV news [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=506.58s)]
*  Yes, mr. Phil Williams the little Iran except Christian, okay [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=514.74s)]
*  But why do you think so that the three I mean I have my own theories [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=520.5s)]
*  But you've lived it much more personally than I have so you tell me why do you think states like? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=524.78s)]
*  Minnesota Oregon [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=531.66s)]
*  Washington [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=533.82s)]
*  California have gone to a place that I think by any objective global standard [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=534.86s)]
*  There's no country in the world that would nod and say that's okay, except maybe the UK. Yeah [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=540.4599999999999s)]
*  How did they get there? I [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=545.42s)]
*  think I [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  Mean for all of them the political power was captured by by the left a political and cultural power [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=549.42s)]
*  I mean I went to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=556.26s)]
*  To college in Minnesota in the in the early 2000s and you can see the seeds of all of these things [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=558.02s)]
*  right beginning to form [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=563.6999999999999s)]
*  And so all of the institutions were captured and especially culturally in Minnesota [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=566.26s)]
*  people [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=572.4200000000001s)]

*  It's very real and right the ethos is if you don't have anything nice to say, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=576.9000000000001s)]

*  Unwilling to give offense. Yes, and very very tolerant of other people [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=605.18s)]
*  Yes, they are and that gets taken advantage of right so you can have they take our best qualities and subvert them against us [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  Yes, and and you can see that in other places too like on the West Coast as well, right? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=615.9s)]
*  that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=623.0999999999999s)]

*  I know where where you told well we need to love other people and be kind and be Christ like and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=631.7399999999999s)]
*  And that ethos gets subverted and used to these ends, right? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=638.5s)]
*  Where well how dare you you know talk about these things? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=642.28s)]
*  Like how how dare you talk about these things from the pulpit that these things going on like it offends a lot of people [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=645.78s)]
*  No, it does I mean I come from a family like that with some of them have strong views [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=651.66s)]

*  It's a very specific northern European culture where they just don't want to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=661.18s)]
*  Don't want to get in your face. No never but it leaves them defenseless. Yes, I think yeah. Yeah, and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=665.86s)]

*  My personality type is is such that I just I can't do that [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=678.62s)]
*  I can't see like evil stuff happen and taking place and not say something about it [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=682.54s)]
*  And that's like this is this is insane. Like how how could we I mean just think a hundred years ago [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=688.12s)]
*  And that's that's sort of you know [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=693.5s)]
*  My book is right if you go back a hundred years and you think about your your great-great-grandfather [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=696.34s)]
*  You told him hey there [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=701.62s)]

*  Are you okay with that? Do you think that's that's all right? Like what would they do if that was even proposed like they thought unix? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=710.1s)]
*  Would I was buying dynasty? Yes, right. We have that. Yeah. Yeah, we're bringing that back [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=715.94s)]

*  My theory is that those are the most secular states. Yeah, and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=741.64s)]
*  Maine is another one of the most secular states unfortunately, and those trends are rising there as well [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=746.0s)]
*  Yeah famously and there's something about that, you know [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=751.46s)]
*  there are lots of left-wing ideas that are liberal ideas or socialist ideas that like [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=755.2s)]
*  Why don't disagree with all of them honestly, but some of them I did a lot of my to really disagree with yeah [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=760.12s)]
*  but the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=764.36s)]
*  transgender thing the abortion thing human sacrifice and [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=765.92s)]
*  Turning your children to unix those are so clearly expressions of cultish religion. Yeah of pagan religion [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=770.84s)]
*  Yeah, that like I can't turn away. I'm like the Canaanites did this. Yeah, I know what's going on here [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=778.0s)]
*  This is not you claim you're secular. You're not secular at all. These are religious rituals [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=783.92s)]
*  It feels to me. Yes [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=788.36s)]
*  Absolutely, it is [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=790.64s)]
*  And and and that's part of it too. I think [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  the things that happen like when I was in college in the early 2000s, you had the new atheism and and [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=795.6s)]
*  Everyone was like it was just cool to be an atheist like oh, I'm agnostic. I don't I don't really believe it [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=801.76s)]
*  Who is that? There's like a really? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=807.52s)]
*  Absurd person posing as like a genius who was one of the leader there probably a bunch of it [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=810.44s)]
*  Who's the most famous one? Oh like Richard Dawkins or Daniel Dennett sir Christopher Hitchens? I knew Hitchens [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=815.24s)]
*  Well, he was a marvelous guy. Yeah, totally [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=822.36s)]
*  He was legit smart. Yeah, no, there's another one [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=825.24s)]
*  Whatever who's always running around like today like James Lindsay is is one of the those types James Lindsay. He's a [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=828.44s)]
*  he is a [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=836.1600000000001s)]
*  This this atheist atheist guy that opposed wokeness and things like that but once [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=838.5200000000001s)]
*  Wants just a free liberal society like it's 1995. Yeah. Yeah, I'm all for a free liberal society. It's just that there [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=843.8s)]
*  There isn't one either you're moving quickly toward [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I will never give up my views of I will never stop being liberal on the most basic level [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  Which is I actually don't want to control you or your beliefs because I don't think you're a slave [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=863.04s)]
*  I think you're a human being because I've made you absolutely. That's my view. Yeah, and so I don't want to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=866.48s)]
*  Break down people's doors to make sure they're adhering to what I believe at all. I hate that. However [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=872.44s)]
*  It you're either moving toward order or you're moving toward chaos. You're moving toward [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=877.8800000000001s)]
*  You know a society rooted in some sort of transcendent belief or you're moving toward traniism, which is another [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=883.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like transcendent belief. It's like yeah, you pick a religion [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=889.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's not whether but which there there will be one and that's part of it [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=892.72s)]
*  It's like the the new like the new atheism all those things that broke down [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=896.6400000000001s)]
*  on you know Christian mores and and and and Christian, you know, just cultural Christianity that was [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=901.16s)]
*  imbued all all throughout [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=908.32s)]
*  You know the American public life takes all of that down [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=909.9200000000001s)]
*  But then there's a vacuum and that vacuum gets filled up and what's it been filled up with insane stuff like this child sacrifice [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=913.44s)]
*  Yeah, you know all of it like it is it is a new religion [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=920.36s)]
*  It isn't it isn't a question of like well, we're just gonna have pluralism or I can have any dominant religion [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=923.32s)]
*  It's no there will be one there will be a God that you serve and and the one that we are serving now is [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=929.0s)]
*  Some kind of demon. Well, I think [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  So much better put than I could have than I could have formulated that but yes exactly perfectly put exactly [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=938.5600000000001s)]
*  You're gonna worship something. Yeah, and now we're worshiping something really really dark [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=944.72s)]
*  Yeah as a society, but it's it's particularly pronounced in the states that have abandoned Christianity the most aggressively and just [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=948.48s)]
*  Come up with this new pagan religion so okay, so this is going on in your state [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=955.96s)]
*  You're the six generations in one town boy. That's got to be pretty rare right now [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=959.96s)]
*  Yeah, you've got six children. You have a child buried in the cemetery along with all your ancestors and [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=964.6s)]
*  You leave all of that. What what's going on in your church? Were you churchgoer at the time? Yeah, I was I was pastoring a church [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=970.0s)]
*  Gosh [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=976.84s)]
*  So you're involved in church, yes I have yeah and it's a church with wonderful people and and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=981.12s)]
*  You know, they're there because they [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=987.52s)]
*  You know more or less think like I do they like us like hearing what I preach, you know, they like [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=990.32s)]
*  they like all of these things and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=995.08s)]
*  And so it's extremely difficult to leave them as well [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=998.08s)]
*  But it was it was difficult because it was very small church and and the things that I'm I'm preaching right so I [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1002.9s)]
*  Take the pastorate there in 2021 [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1010.18s)]
*  so after the lockdowns after all of these things and there's there's an incredible amount of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1013.06s)]
*  Discontent among Christians because their church has been shut down their leaders have failed them [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1017.6999999999999s)]
*  And so we had we had many families join us, you know after that [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1023.02s)]
*  But [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1028.06s)]
*  You know overall right the people you know in in Minnesota, right they don't they're not used to [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1029.1399999999999s)]
*  the kind of preaching that that I do the kind of [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1037.1s)]
*  Christianity that I have where it's like I know I believe the Bible like like God is real and he has spoken [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1042.9399999999998s)]
*  he's revealed himself to us in the Bible and [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1048.98s)]
*  Therefore I believe all of it and I'm not embarrassed by any of it [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1053.06s)]
*  I'm not gonna like tiptoe around the things that might be controversial [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1056.62s)]
*  if anything, I'm gonna lean into those things and [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1060.3799999999999s)]
*  And I preach all of it and that's that runs totally against the evangelical Christian ethos in [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1063.46s)]
*  America today. It's really [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1071.3799999999999s)]
*  The it's it's all about you need to be nice [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1073.9399999999998s)]
*  You need to you know make make Jesus very inoffensive to people and that's how you bring people into your church [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1076.74s)]
*  I'll say I'm not an evangelical. I'm always like the evangelicals. I've always defended them [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1082.94s)]
*  I'm very sympathetic as an uneven. I'm not even exactly sure what an evangelical is. It seems like a cultural descriptor, but [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1087.96s)]
*  I'm completely opposed to abortion. So that has been [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1095.18s)]
*  For me the reason that I've always defended them, but I always thought [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1099.1399999999999s)]
*  that the evangelicals were really forthright about their faith another thing that I liked yeah, and [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  We're way more on the kind of fire and brimstone side which I'm for by the way [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1108.5800000000002s)]
*  But you're saying that they're not [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1114.74s)]
*  That that was certainly I you look at like, you know [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1117.5800000000002s)]
*  The 80s and even in the early 90s like you have the moral majority where yeah [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1120.9s)]
*  They very much were that kind of fire and brimstone and they've they've been vindicated by everything that has happened. I'd say [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1124.5400000000002s)]
*  I'd say [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1130.38s)]
*  That's hilarious [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1132.38s)]
*  Lent is here the period before Easter the 40 days and it's a unique chance to get closer to God [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1133.98s)]
*  That's the point of it. Hello the world's number one prayer app can help you do that joining their prayer 40 challenge [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1139.8600000000001s)]

*  Um, I think you know a friend of mine. I think I could call my friend [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1256.66s)]
*  Aaron Wren he's written about this like neutral world or negative world neutral world positive world where you know in the 70s and 80s [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1262.54s)]
*  A Christianity is generally understood culturally as as a positive thing like if you said, oh I go to church [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1271.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm a Christian I go to that church people think oh, that's a good guy. He's he's an upstanding [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1277.24s)]
*  decent person [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1281.5s)]
*  But by the by the mid 90s, it was it was sort of neutral, right? It was sort of [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1282.86s)]
*  Well, that's just a cool thing that you do right just like collecting stamps or building model trains or being part of the Lions Club [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1288.86s)]
*  but by the [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1296.1399999999999s)]
*  You know by the Obama years by like 2015 [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1297.86s)]
*  You're in negative world where if you're an evangelical Christian you are suspect. You're you're probably a Nazi [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1301.4199999999998s)]
*  You're probably a bigot. You're probably a white supremacist, right? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1307.84s)]
*  That's the attitude that people has asked you to pause just to state for the 1 millionth time the Nazis were not Christians [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1311.26s)]
*  They were not Christians, but they love to throw those things around it [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1319.5s)]
*  Christian new [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1323.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1326.34s)]
*  More Christians were killed by the Nazis in any other group just a fact [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1327.9399999999998s)]
*  So anyway, no the Nazis were not Christians. I just I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. Yeah [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1332.1399999999999s)]
*  Good to make you know, yeah, because they'll clip this and they'll say yeah [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1337.06s)]
*  Oh, and riskers saying that the the Christians are Nazis but um [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1340.34s)]
*  so that that [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1346.1s)]
*  Period of time like there's these widespread cultural shifts in the country [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1347.8999999999999s)]
*  And so I think a lot of it is just in response to that where you're in that neutral world [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1352.28s)]
*  And so you had your figures like like Rick Warren or Tim Keller who? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1356.0s)]
*  who sort of adapted these things so Tim Keller is in New York City and and he [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1361.9399999999998s)]
*  He tries to adapt you know Christianity to [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1367.5s)]
*  Your you know upper middle class [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1372.4199999999998s)]
*  You know strive for people in New York City would make it easy for them to come to church [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1375.74s)]
*  So he wouldn't ever you know talk about homosexuality or if he did it would be well, that's not so good for human flourishing [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1380.26s)]
*  But we're not really gonna talk about that too much [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1387.82s)]
*  there's a [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1391.26s)]
*  The former president of the Southern Baptist Convention JD Greer, you know famously [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1392.58s)]
*  Said in a sermon. Well, the Bible just whispers about sexual sin, but it shouts about [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1398.18s)]
*  About like financial sin or greed, right? So they want to downplay shots were both of them [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1404.9s)]
*  It does and the two are connected [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1410.64s)]
*  Right if you're if you're you greedy for money, you're also going to be lusting after the flesh like that the two go hand-in-hand [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1413.86s)]
*  and [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1420.54s)]
*  And so but it's to downplay things that the culture [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1421.78s)]
*  Does not want to hear right because you'll be branded as a bigot as intolerant as a bad person if you're just like well [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1425.82s)]
*  This is what the Bible says like this, you know [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1432.3000000000002s)]
*  Fornicators adulterers sodomites that they will not inherit the kingdom of God right if you say yes, I agree with that [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1434.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, you're a bad person right? You're you're you are outside of [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1440.46s)]
*  Polite society if you say those and and you can reject it you can reject Christianity itself [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1444.98s)]
*  Yeah, certainly welcome to in this country and in all countries actually but [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1450.14s)]
*  It doesn't just say this parenthetically. No, it's like included in a sidebar [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1454.26s)]
*  It says it again and again and again and the church I grew up and they're like, well, they're only four times where [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1459.22s)]
*  you know in the scriptures where people you know, we're Christian were homosexualities attacked and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1464.98s)]
*  It's like since no one ever read it. Yeah my church. No [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1470.98s)]
*  But like I read finally read it. What the hell why not read it and I did and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1475.82s)]
*  And I've never been [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1481.74s)]
*  Anti-gay or anything like that, but by the end I was like, oh, there's a really clear message [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1483.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah from like the Hebrew scriptures all the way through [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1488.3s)]
*  The Christian to the New Testament and like again and again and again [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1493.06s)]
*  So, you know again, you don't have to believe it. But if you're a believing Christian it it's not whispered at all [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1497.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you do you do have to believe it if you're a Christian exactly claim that you that this is the Bible that God spoke [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1503.62s)]
*  He's right and and so they're very fearful [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1509.6999999999998s)]
*  of those kinds of things but I [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1513.3799999999999s)]
*  Mean the interesting thing now that we're in, you know what Wren calls negative world is [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1516.86s)]
*  Is that young men [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1524.02s)]
*  Who who were kind of you were raised most of them like raised secular, right? They went through the the whole new AC atheism thing [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1527.1s)]
*  They never went to church. They never grew up. I mean I talked to so many guys so so many young men [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1535.1799999999998s)]
*  You know [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1540.3s)]
*  I see you know connect with me on on X and in places like that where they're like [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1540.58s)]
*  Hey, I was not part of the church at all. I was not a Christian and [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1546.1s)]
*  I see all of the evil [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1550.98s)]
*  Everywhere, right? I see the things like you're talking about like they they are sacrificing babies [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1555.26s)]
*  I guess they care about this more than anything else that the ability to murder a baby [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1560.0s)]
*  they see things like the Ukraine war where it's like [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1564.82s)]
*  Our rulers just decided to have a war [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1568.54s)]
*  and kill millions of people for [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1572.46s)]
*  Absolutely. No reason and our proxies have banned the majority Christian faith. Yes banned [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1576.26s)]
*  Yes, Jordy Christian faith the majority faith, which is Christian in Ukraine [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1581.22s)]
*  And I just wonder just to go back to the atheist for a second [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1585.22s)]
*  What do they make of this? Like it just I understand certainly understand being agnostic. Like I don't know, you know, I get it [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1590.82s)]
*  Yeah, I can see why someone would have that view for sure. Yeah [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1597.22s)]
*  Um, I think that's a pretty normal, you know place to be I think it's wrong, but I don't think it's crazy [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1600.06s)]
*  Yeah, but to be an atheist to have determined that there is no God [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1605.5s)]
*  Like what do you make of the things you see around you if you never hold held someone's hand while he dies [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1609.6200000000001s)]
*  Like what do you think that is? Yeah, you never felt anything [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1614.0800000000002s)]
*  That is clearly outside of what science describes like how determined are you to ignore? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1618.26s)]
*  Your life. Yeah. Yeah that you become an atheist. Like what is that? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1626.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's funny because most of the people that you talk to you are like when they espouse kind of atheist atheist ideas [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1631.46s)]
*  Right. They'll retreat. It's kind of a Mott and Bailey thing where they'll retreat to ignore. Well, I really I'm agnostic [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1639.34s)]
*  I don't really know for sure right? So there's very few people very few especially now [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1645.02s)]
*  That are like, you know, I'm an atheist there definitely is no God. Okay. Well, then how wise murder wrong? Yeah. Yeah, exactly [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1649.98s)]
*  Well, because it is because it is well, okay, I think it's right [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1656.54s)]
*  Yeah, so how does that how can you tell me it's wrong by what authority? Yeah, yeah, cuz you feel that way [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1660.22s)]
*  That's your authority your emotions and you would see this [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1665.42s)]
*  I remember so like the people you were saying who are atheists like they ever some of them are smart. I assume [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1668.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, what do they say to that? I remember [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1672.6200000000001s)]
*  I remember watching, you know [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1675.9s)]
*  Previous guest of yours actually the man who trained me in ministry Doug Wilson. Yeah [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1678.8600000000001s)]
*  Debate wonderful man, Christopher Hitchens. Yeah, right. Oh, yes, and they they had that discussion, right and [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1683.46s)]
*  It was it was shocking to watch Hitchens say well, it's you know, it's common human experience, you know [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1690.02s)]
*  You know solidarity with mankind. That's why I think murder is wrong. And of course Doug says to him [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1696.62s)]
*  Well, you know, well if you saw someone being like murdered on the street, you do think that's bad, right? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1701.98s)]
*  well, why and he goes into his whole spiel and [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1705.9399999999998s)]
*  He's like well, what if what if it's a pregnant woman and her baby's being murdered, right you would just say well [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1709.06s)]
*  No, no, you need to have a medical license for that to kill that person, right? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1716.02s)]
*  Say oh you're being flippant [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1721.26s)]
*  You wouldn't go down that road. Yeah, what's so sad is I knew Christopher very well and always liked him enormously [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1723.6599999999999s)]
*  for his air edition [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1729.7s)]

*  dinners with him before I quit drinking and [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1747.74s)]
*  But he was such and so I love Christopher, but he was a moralizer [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1751.1000000000001s)]
*  Whoa, yeah, and I never I was much younger 25 years younger than I am now [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1756.02s)]
*  And I never sort of put it to my mind like how can an atheist be a moralizer? Yeah [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1760.78s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense actually. Yeah, and I agree to them on some things and discrete and others [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1765.94s)]
*  But he was always like in the pulpit actually. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and a lot of the atheists are yeah. What is that? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1770.18s)]
*  Well, I think so much of it is is atheism really is like it's moralizer. It's hilarious [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1777.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, it's it's a Christian heresy like they want to they want to have all the things of Christianity just without without God there [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1783.8200000000002s)]
*  right, so they they want to be able to [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1789.66s)]
*  Pursue all of these things right they want to be able to say this is right and this is wrong [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1792.5800000000002s)]
*  But have no no authority to ground it on right just just by their say so right? It's [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1797.26s)]
*  Though I mean yeah [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1803.5400000000002s)]
*  It's wrong. Well, you could you could say why yeah, you can see why it's breaking down though [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1806.22s)]
*  Today under the weight of its own silliness. Yeah. Yeah [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1812.02s)]
*  It creates this vacuum and it's being replaced by something [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1815.26s)]
*  So all of the all of the moralistic energy is still there and now it's gone to [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1819.1s)]
*  To things like transgenderism abortion. Yes [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1825.22s)]
*  You know Gaza, whatever whatever like it goes it goes to all of those routes. It goes to you know BLM and and rioting [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1828.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's right [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1836.5s)]
*  And and so it's highly religious in us. Yeah, it's in us. We can't get away from [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1837.78s)]
*  The conviction the true conviction that some things are right and some things are wrong. Yeah. Yeah [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1843.8600000000001s)]
*  It's fundamentally human. Absolutely. So but an atheist would have to by definition be utterly not non-judgmental about everything like on [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1848.58s)]
*  you think they should be but [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1857.1799999999998s)]
*  They're the most judgmental people. It's unbelievable. I mean Christopher at dinner was always lecturing about the Kurds [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1859.4199999999998s)]
*  And I'm nothing against the Kurds. I don't know much about the Kurds. I ran into them in Iraq [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1865.6999999999998s)]
*  I there were the most bloodthirsty people in Iraq. I did notice that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1870.1s)]
*  So I'm again, I'm not against the Kurds, you know, I'm not an expert in [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1874.4199999999998s)]
*  Kurdishness but [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1878.22s)]
*  He man he would like lay down his life for the Kurds [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1880.74s)]
*  Yeah, I remember thinking what is this and it was the need to sort of find a good guy and a bad guy and yeah [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1883.78s)]
*  Put yourself in the good guy's side. Yeah. Yeah, and that's that's human. It's human. We want that. That's totally true [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1889.72s)]
*  So what did you say to your church when you left? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1896.06s)]
*  That was [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1899.98s)]
*  That was one of the hardest days of my life. I believe it tell them I'm I'm leaving. I'm going to Tennessee [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1901.18s)]
*  and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1907.58s)]
*  It was it was difficult. I mean I still have a [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1908.82s)]
*  Connection with them relationship with them still I'm still trying to find them a pastor to replace me, right? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1913.3799999999999s)]
*  It's hard to it's it's hard for me to do that because like well you left Andrew white you want me to go there now [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1919.1s)]
*  But they they need one and and they're wonderful wonderful people [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1924.7s)]
*  Who have have blessed me immensely and and I just told them that [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1929.1399999999999s)]
*  no, I [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1935.18s)]
*  Have to leave Minnesota [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1936.78s)]
*  there is [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1938.62s)]
*  there's a place for me there in in Tennessee and [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1940.7s)]
*  It's it's ultimately you know, what is best for my family's future right there. There's a place where [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1945.82s)]
*  Where my children, you know can grow up because part of it too is [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1952.22s)]
*  Isn't just the things that that we're leaving, you know, the political cultural things that we're leaving in Minnesota, but it's also [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1956.7s)]
*  You know overall the things that have been done [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1962.06s)]
*  To the Midwest to to everywhere where [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1964.98s)]
*  My children grow up and [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1969.54s)]
*  If if they want to have you know career and a life and a family and a success of their own [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1971.6599999999999s)]
*  There just isn't much for them in a small town [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1978.58s)]
*  Midwest and [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1982.06s)]
*  And and so they'll all just fly the coop like I mean, this is what happened [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1984.74s)]
*  Like when I graduate from high school [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1989.34s)]
*  Most of the people that I grew up with they all they all left they went to the Twin Cities [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1991.58s)]
*  they went to other other cities for work and for for careers and [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=1995.5s)]
*  and so that that same thing was likely going to happen with with my children and I look at and I think well [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2001.34s)]
*  my family's been here for six generations and [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2007.34s)]
*  whether [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2010.58s)]
*  it's going to end here, right and I [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2012.26s)]
*  Want I want to be in a place where we can continue that where we can be rooted where my children [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2015.94s)]
*  have the ability to stay in a place and and so so many so many friends are coming to [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2022.0600000000002s)]
*  To Tennessee where we are they're bringing businesses there and once you build things at scale like the more stuff [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2029.0600000000002s)]
*  you're able to do the more businesses you're able to have the more opportunity is for for young people and [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2035.3s)]
*  And so right if my children want to stay where we are and continue that on [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2041.06s)]
*  Generation after generation like we actually will be able to do that, right? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2046.3s)]
*  That's it isn't it wasn't so much just okay. We need to leave Minnesota [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2050.06s)]
*  But it's also we're being drawn to a place for a particular reason that Tennessee dream. There's a future there. Yeah [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2054.54s)]
*  Yeah, the the hope of [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2060.54s)]
*  refugees from time immemorial. Yeah [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2063.3s)]
*  What are the other churches in the state say as the state itself became a place that faithful Christians couldn't live [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2066.06s)]
*  I mean there there are a handful of [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2073.7400000000002s)]
*  Of churches there that are they're very strong. All right, there are there are Christians there that that oppose these things, but they're so [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2076.1s)]
*  so vastly outnumbered like when I went [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2083.06s)]
*  When I went to the state capital to you know, oppose the abortion bill [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2086.1800000000003s)]
*  There were lots of activists on both sides [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2091.1800000000003s)]
*  Pro life activists and pro [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2093.96s)]
*  ritual sacrifice activists [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2097.64s)]
*  But there were there were no other pastors there. I think the one of the Catholic bishops [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2099.7999999999997s)]
*  Did a Skype call zoom call? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2106.68s)]
*  but [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2109.68s)]
*  Beyond that there were there were no other pastors and I'm thinking like my church is is like 30 40 people [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2110.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm a I do this, you know, it's it's I tent make I do I do a full-time job and then do this [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2116.12s)]
*  We're tiny I'm I'm small I'm insignificant and and there are churches with [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2121.3199999999997s)]
*  15 20,000 people prominent men in [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2127.3599999999997s)]
*  in the Twin Cities and [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2131.08s)]
*  And all I had to do was just send an email to the the clerk of the committee like hey [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2133.8799999999997s)]
*  Can I have two minutes to speak? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2137.8799999999997s)]
*  No one showed up right? No one is there and that's like no [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2139.96s)]
*  They're going to like murder babies up to birth like enshrine this [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2142.96s)]
*  In in our law try to make a constitutional amendment for it all of these things [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2147.12s)]
*  and and no one is [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2150.96s)]
*  Is opposing it's like I'm the only one that came I I quoted the Bible like hey and and opposed it as a Christian [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2153.48s)]
*  All right, they [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2161.04s)]
*  There's just so little fight there Christians built your state [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2162.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes, and all of it and every bit of it and it's so telling when you go to the Twin Cities [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2167.72s)]
*  I think of them as Protestant Catholic. Yeah, I think of them as [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2174.04s)]
*  Scandinavian in Minneapolis and Irish [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2178.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and others in St. Paul. Yeah, but both of them, especially St. Paul [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2180.66s)]
*  Just littered with churches and schools and yeah, it's just like the infrastructure of those cities was built by Christians [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2186.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and so it's a little bit crazy that first of all, it's been taken over by people who who have made a point [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2191.66s)]
*  Yeah, just you know, just stick a finger in the eye of Christians make it impossible for them to live there [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2198.62s)]
*  It's like you're being driven out of your own [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2203.12s)]
*  Homeland six generations. Yeah, I mean this is what happened with with my wife is from st. Paul [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2205.12s)]
*  her [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2211.2s)]
*  You know father's side of the family is Polish Catholic. Yeah went to st. Casper's church [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2213.04s)]
*  Exactly. That's exactly in my mind what I think in the neighborhood that they they were in it was all all Polish people [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2218.04s)]
*  But now it's all it's all mung right everywhere. It's all mung and Somali and [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2224.72s)]
*  Everyone there just left over the last two or three generations [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2230.96s)]
*  Are there churches and parochial schools and like well st. Casper's church is there but it's it's largely empty [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2234.68s)]
*  All right. We went there for a funeral a couple years ago, but there's I mean people still attended [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2240.16s)]
*  But it's not like it not like it was most of the most of the parishes there have shut down the church [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2244.96s)]
*  the church schools have have shut down and and they've moved out to the suburbs and [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2249.76s)]
*  So that I mean it was that was a Polish neighborhood. It was it was [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2254.92s)]
*  Right this ethnic enclave if I can just say on showing myself to be an ethnic [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2260.2s)]
*  Nationalist the pole they're just like some of the greatest people. Yeah, I've ever met I don't think I've ever met [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2266.0s)]
*  I have to say that married one. So yeah, I just think they're great people. I don't know I've met many I don't like but [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2271.68s)]
*  Just salt to the earth smart. Yeah hard-working [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2277.28s)]
*  Serious about faith and family. Yeah, great people. Yeah [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2280.08s)]
*  My doubt it was an improvement the change to st. Paul. In fact, it wasn't I've been no that it's [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2283.32s)]
*  Like when when her parents finally moved like it the whole area is is just is run down lots of crime, you know [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2288.04s)]
*  it's it's sad because it was [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2295.08s)]
*  it was you could see the the [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2298.2000000000003s)]

*  Mean I think it's it's it's largely [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2371.76s)]
*  the the contemporary evangelical mode of being is [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2375.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean so much of it. I [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2379.2000000000003s)]

*  Being you know going all the way back to something like the Second Great Awakening, right where? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2384.28s)]
*  the purpose of [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2389.1600000000003s)]
*  the major change that took place there is [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2390.76s)]
*  It it's all about conversionism, right? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2394.4s)]
*  And and it becomes a big show and marketing and and all of that and that's where we got the ten revival [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2397.4s)]
*  Yeah, yes. Yeah, Charles Finney those those kind of things [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2404.44s)]
*  Well that that's kind of in the DNA at least somewhat within evangelicalism to put a finer point out what you're saying the point became [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2407.6000000000004s)]
*  The more souls we convert more people who profess faith. Yeah, that's like the scorecard that we use [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2414.92s)]
*  yeah, that's the metric that that [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2420.86s)]
*  Everyone follows and and so you look at it and you think well if we just if we just water it down a little bit more [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2424.56s)]
*  Make it more palatable to people [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2430.8s)]
*  You know just get more more butts in the seats, right then [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2433.32s)]
*  That's the metric of success [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2437.52s)]
*  Not write the internal development [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2439.7200000000003s)]
*  discipleship of people not not actual [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2443.28s)]
*  repentance and conversion [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2446.04s)]
*  Not you know fundamental life change and so forth [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2447.7200000000003s)]
*  That traditional Christianity always was it's off we just get them here and [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2452.16s)]
*  of course if they put some money in the plate and and [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2458.08s)]
*  They're attending. That's what matters. So you see churches where it's like, okay, we have [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2461.12s)]
*  Amazing production values. We have a great band and all of these things and it's it's all of these entertainments to get people in or [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2466.28s)]
*  The sermon is is sort of like a self-help talk [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2471.92s)]
*  There isn't really Bible in it at all or if it is it's like tangentially [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2475.08s)]
*  Related to to something that the pastor wants to say it's not [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2478.84s)]
*  Alright, we're gonna go through a chapter of Leviticus today and explain what the sacrifices are about. Well, there's no [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2482.92s)]
*  There's none of those things and see you see you many evangelical people [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2488.88s)]
*  I have not been taught really any Bible or theology at all and you see this in like surveys like the Barna group does surveys [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2493.4s)]
*  and all right what people believe about different things and [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2500.76s)]
*  And they haven't been taught any Bible [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2504.28s)]
*  They don't they don't know it and so then when you know when the the liberal says well [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2506.76s)]
*  the Bible condemns eating shellfish and pork and [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2513.1200000000003s)]
*  In the same way it condemns homosexuality. So what do you have to say about that? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2516.6000000000004s)]
*  and they have no idea how to explain that what that is about and [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2519.8s)]
*  And their faith is shaken or I didn't destroy two cities with sulfur and fire because people were eating pork. That's right [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2524.6000000000004s)]
*  You destroy them because they tried to [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2531.6000000000004s)]
*  Commit gay rape on an angel. Yeah. Yeah, and they'll just say that with well the sin of Sodom was in hospitality [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2534.6s)]
*  No, it wasn't. Well, I mean I guess it was gay rape. Yeah [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2541.44s)]
*  The least hospitable you can do it if you want [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2544.96s)]
*  It's pretty out there. Yeah, it's like well [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2549.12s)]
*  Yeah, the least is hospitable thing you could do to a guest is to annually rape them [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2551.0s)]
*  Yeah, so all the men of the town came out they demanded. Yeah, we need to know these angels to have sex with these [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2555.3199999999997s)]

*  Like I mean, I'm a pastor my calling is to is to preach the gospel and to lead worship and and that book right there [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2877.68s)]
*  All of it is about how to [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2885.68s)]
*  Sinful people [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2888.64s)]
*  Draw near and approach the presence of a holy just righteous God that cannot bear sin at all and [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2890.16s)]
*  There it's laid out for us all of it and and even like you look at [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2898.24s)]
*  Lividicus chapter 9 [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2903.3999999999996s)]
*  Like you read that maybe you remember reading it [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2905.12s)]
*  I'm actually you know going through this with with my church right now in Tennessee [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2907.6s)]
*  But live because chapter 9 is the entire [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2911.68s)]
*  Liturgy of the church right there each each of the sacrifices and all of the like Western liturgy for 2,000 years [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2915.2999999999997s)]
*  Basically follows it right you you're called into the presence of God [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2923.8999999999996s)]
*  you [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2927.9399999999996s)]
*  You confess your sins [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2929.46s)]
*  I mean you probably like your Episcopalian upbringing Book of Common Prayer like you probably track with this [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2930.98s)]
*  Right you can never they never admitted that in our church. Yeah [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2936.3399999999997s)]
*  Maybe they didn't have a confession of sin of yours, but but there's a confession of sin [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2939.8199999999997s)]
*  Right then there's an ascension right the ascension offering in chapter 1 of the biticus [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2944.38s)]
*  Right the entire the worshiper puts his hand on the animal right saying like this animal's me [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2949.38s)]
*  And then the entire thing is is consumed is burned up right Ola right where the word Holocaust comes from [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2954.1s)]
*  consumed burned up goes up to God in smoke and [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2960.5s)]
*  That's you right that's when and and then the New Testament where it says right the word of God is living inactive sharper than any [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2964.1s)]
*  Two-edged sword what's the sort of the priest that cuts up the animal and puts it on the altar and burns it up [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2971.02s)]
*  Well, that's what's happening when the church hears the Bible read and hears it preached right you're being cut up by the Word of God [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2976.3s)]
*  And ascending up to God in smoke and then the next part of the service is the peace offering well [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2982.1s)]
*  That's communion right you sit down and have a meal with with God [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2988.86s)]
*  And then you're sent out right the entire liturgy is right there like our actual worship that we do now [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2992.1s)]
*  Right after the death of Jesus and resurrection of Jesus [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=2997.86s)]
*  right sacrifice is done away with because he he is that sacrifice and [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3001.02s)]
*  We're going through all of that each time we worship and and renew the covenant with God and [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3006.3s)]
*  And like you see that in in Leviticus, and it's like whoa [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3012.3s)]
*  Actually, there's so much to learn here in this book about what we are doing every every Sunday when we when we worship God [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3015.86s)]
*  So I'm like yeah, this of course is my favorite book right not just because I'm autistic and like lots of rules and regulations [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3023.34s)]
*  Right it's like reading the [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3030.3399999999997s)]
*  Reading the instructions on on the Monopoly game. You know like no it's it's it's it's there like so much is happening [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3032.54s)]
*  It's it's it's beautiful and and the [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3038.94s)]
*  prescriptions or the prohibitions more precisely are [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3043.22s)]
*  Surprisingly like sensible yeah [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3047.42s)]
*  Yeah, and one of the challenges to atheism is to explain why the atheist would agree with the overwhelming majority of what's prohibited [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3050.02s)]
*  Yeah, because it's it's in him. He knows that's wrong. Don't have sex with your sister. Okay, okay [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3057.24s)]
*  And most people most atheists would be like yeah, well obviously [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3062.64s)]
*  But of course he has no grounds upon which to say that yeah [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3067.7599999999998s)]
*  There's literally no law he can appeal to to say that he says that obviously because like he grew up and was is reared and [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3070.9599999999996s)]
*  Absorbed by osmosis like Christian culture where that's prohibited. I think that's right [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3077.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I also think in primitive cultures that have never had exposure to Christianity [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3081.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that there are many cultures where most of the prohibitions in Leviticus would be considered crazy [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3086.72s)]
*  No, or esoteric or like why would you ban that? It's like everyone like of course [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3093.2799999999997s)]
*  well even like you you think about this there was um, there's a [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3098.3999999999996s)]
*  Pastor theologian a brilliant guy Peter Leidhart who wrote a book delivered from the elements of the world and and in that [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3103.72s)]
*  He shows I mean there's tons of just amazing stuff in this book [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3111.52s)]
*  But one of the things that he shows is that right God makes these restrictions for for Israel in the Old Covenant [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3116.08s)]
*  that sets them apart as this holy people as the priestly people and [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3124.16s)]
*  But elsewhere in the world, right? They all have something like that, right? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3129.2s)]
*  All throughout the ancient world right there gods had something like a funhouse mirror version of Leviticus where it's like, okay, right? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3133.7599999999998s)]
*  Here's all these rules about sex and and what makes you clean and unclean and food [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3140.88s)]
*  You can't eat and can't eat like the Egyptians had this the Babylonians the Persians [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3144.92s)]
*  Greeks all of them have these kinds of the the Mayans the Incas the Aztecs like my ancestors the [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3149.36s)]
*  Germanics like they all had these these rules and it's what's because in the ancient world right there all under their own particular gods [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3155.52s)]
*  right and [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3162.8s)]
*  What what Jesus does is he comes and he he takes the world back [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3165.1200000000003s)]
*  from Satan and from all the demons that ruled over the ancient world and [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3170.88s)]
*  And now he's reigning over heaven or that that's actually like the book of Revelation [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3175.6000000000004s)]
*  But that's actually like what's going on in that book the much maligned. Yeah, good revelation [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3181.36s)]
*  Yeah, like I know you had you had John rich on, you know last year and he's talking about dispensationalism and things like that [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3185.84s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm gonna be in Tennessee. I need to meet him and talk to him about this [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3192.96s)]
*  Did you I haven't no I'd have no way of getting a touch with maybe after this if you watch it [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3197.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good man. Oh, I love I mean he was [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3202.8999999999996s)]
*  Like the soundtrack of my youth of country music like he wrote all those songs, right? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3205.62s)]
*  So on that basis alone, right? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3210.16s)]
*  But um, he's talking about like dispensationalism and what has happened in in American Christianity for the last 130 years [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3212.02s)]
*  How it's actually a novel new thing [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3219.04s)]
*  and [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3222.1s)]
*  and for me it was it was like [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3223.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I looked at that [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3226.7s)]
*  I mean, I remember you know growing up and that's just everything like left behind and and the rapture is coming and all of that [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3228.18s)]
*  And when I missed all of that, yeah [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3234.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's a thing like like especially [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3237.62s)]
*  And of course like I'm very critical of it [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3241.06s)]
*  but like these are the [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3244.58s)]
*  These are the best people in America that believe it like the people that have like six Trump flags on the back of their truck [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3246.5s)]
*  Like they they also believe that well the rapture is coming tomorrow [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3253.06s)]
*  We need to be ready for it. And so I'm anytime I'm critical of it. I'm like, okay [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3257.22s)]
*  I'm not critical of the people like there's not a moral defect that they believe these things. Um, I [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3261.64s)]
*  Totally first of all, thank you for saying that second. I feel what you're saying [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3266.66s)]
*  Especially with evangelicals. I look at these, you know [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3270.78s)]
*  greaseball preachers who I [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3273.98s)]

*  you're trying your very hardest against headwinds that are so unfair and [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3284.56s)]
*  You're doing a great job anyway, and I just love that. I really mean it. I love them [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3288.6s)]

*  They'll have a six-pack and they'll give you two of them. I mean, they really are just the most generous kind hilarious [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3459.46s)]
*  Wise just good people. Yeah, the best the best that this country's ever produced in my opinion. Yeah [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3465.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm not I'm not from those people at all. So I'm like coming at this like wow, these people are incredible [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3471.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And and so I you know, I think about that right and I think about [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3476.98s)]
*  The theology that has been that it that has shaped [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3483.1s)]
*  You know their outlook and and it's understandable because like you're especially in the midst of like serious decline. It's like well actually [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3486.5s)]
*  It's sort of attractive to have this eschatology where everything is coming to an end, right? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3493.9s)]
*  You can understand what you would would eat that up [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3499.7799999999997s)]
*  But the people that actually built America, right? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3502.54s)]
*  You know the Puritans and all of the the settlers of this country you think of even like the founding generation [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3505.8999999999996s)]
*  That that theology did not exist yet [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3511.7799999999997s)]
*  That wasn't until the middle of the 19th century that it came into being like they were actually optimistic [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3513.7799999999997s)]
*  right, they they viewed right this continent as [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3518.9399999999996s)]
*  As a place for for Christians to to build to grow to have a future [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3522.7799999999997s)]
*  What an interesting point [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3528.1s)]
*  Well, I've never thought of that before so [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3531.1s)]
*  Dispensationalism for those who haven't followed it is normally criticized and defended [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3533.42s)]
*  because of its [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3538.34s)]
*  Interpretation of what biblical Israel is now. Yeah, okay. Yeah [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3540.54s)]
*  So it's like it's a super electric topic both very illogically and politically absolutely and [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3545.1s)]
*  People get utterly hysterical about it and start calling you names or whatever. Yeah [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3552.82s)]
*  So there's that but you're saying that [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3557.26s)]
*  The deeper or a deeper problem with it is that it makes [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3561.1800000000003s)]
*  People pessimistic. Yeah, you flush it out a little bit [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3565.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so I think if I mean if you think if you go your entire life believing that any minute [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3568.9s)]
*  The world is going to come to an end. Yes that I'm gonna float up into heaven and my clothes will be here [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3577.1400000000003s)]
*  And everything everything we we're gone it's it's done it's over [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3583.4199999999996s)]
*  Right well that that takes a people that ordinarily are [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3588.62s)]
*  our very low time preference that that [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3592.9399999999996s)]
*  Build things for the future that that delay gratification and all of those kinds of things and it flips it around [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3596.5s)]
*  It makes them very high time preference where it's like [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3602.5s)]
*  Well, if the world's not gonna be around tomorrow, why invest in anything? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3604.8599999999997s)]
*  Yes for today and you can even see this in terms of architecture [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3608.22s)]
*  Right you think of the buildings that that churches have well, they they they're in strip malls or they're you know, just [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3611.42s)]
*  They're kind of ugly. Yeah. Yeah, and you look at the buildings that [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3619.42s)]
*  former pet store and yeah [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3623.54s)]
*  Yeah, you look at the buildings that Christians had before this was the dominant theology and they're gorgeous [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3625.58s)]
*  they're beautiful and there were very poor people that made them like you said earlier and [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3631.26s)]
*  And it's like that that that right there like you see it tangibly that [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3636.54s)]
*  And you think about that in terms of all of life and it's so smart and what was the phrase you low time preference? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3641.42s)]
*  Yeah, low time preference. It's like an economic phrase, right? So right your your preference. Please respect my ignorance [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3646.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes, it just means that [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3654.98s)]
*  You [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3658.3s)]
*  You're going to wait longer for things. It's sort of like the marshmallow test with little kids, right? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3660.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, where the one where they can five minutes you'll get two marshmallows or he can eat this one right now, right? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3666.1s)]
*  Well, the the child that says oh, I'll wait I want to right well [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3671.54s)]
*  He's gonna go on and have more success and and so forth [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3675.52s)]
*  Versus the one that has that immediately grabs the one and eats it right? Well, that's that's low time preference [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3678.66s)]
*  It's yes, it's a people that will delay gratification [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3684.06s)]
*  Who will save and invest and and build things for the long term for the future and for future generation? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3687.1s)]
*  Yes. Yes, they plant oak trees. Yes who plants oak trees. Yeah. Well, I mean we're going to in tennis [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3694.7799999999997s)]
*  We want to have bring back the American chestnut in [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3701.5s)]
*  We want to bring that back you putting in evergreens, please. Oh, I think everything yeah, I mean there's there's pines [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3705.06s)]
*  Yeah, there's these don't neglect the pine. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know it's a fast growing tree relatively speaking, but it's it's beautiful [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3710.62s)]
*  It's the answer in cedars if you can if you have water [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3717.66s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if we'll be able [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3720.8199999999997s)]
*  Now we're gonna do it since you're a pre-toural testament scholar. What was the inside of the temple clad with a cedar? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3723.54s)]
*  Yeah from Lebanon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, God himself said cedar. That's right. Yeah an accident. He was pretty specific about it [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3729.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it smells great. Maybe there's a reason my sauna has cedar in the other [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3736.46s)]
*  Like the temple it's my cedar church, yes, right [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3744.42s)]
*  Well, here's something you may not have known this network almost didn't exist [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3747.82s)]
*  Trademark issue almost prevented us from launching by blocking us from using the name TCN [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3751.82s)]
*  Now a company called the American Country Network owned the rights to that trademark and we were not sure if they would give them up [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3757.54s)]
*  Looking back American Country Network could have demanded a lot of money [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3764.14s)]
*  They could have held us up a gunpoint in exchange for the name TCN and a lot of businesses would have done that but they didn't [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3767.34s)]
*  They were incredibly nice. They gave us the name for free and they gave it to us quick [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3772.7400000000002s)]
*  That's we realized this is not your average company at all. These are really really nice people [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3780.34s)]
*  I'm glad this happened because it let us get to know the American Country Network. It turns out it's a great place [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3785.28s)]
*  Its leaders are excellent people of the same values that we do and we think that you do [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3790.9s)]
*  American Country Network is a family friendly [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3795.62s)]
*  Conservative Christian group bringing the best country music to millions of households across the country and it's growing fast [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3797.6800000000003s)]
*  They launched just last year [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3803.0s)]
*  They plan to reach 40 million homes in 2025 as the only Nashville based Country Music Network left. There's only one [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3804.46s)]
*  American Country Network is here to stay [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3812.86s)]
*  We really cannot recommend them highly enough to you and we're grateful to them for their kindness to us [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3814.54s)]
*  They did it for no reason other than to be nice. So we're we're especially grateful for that [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3819.7s)]
*  We always are so go to ACN country comm to enjoy everything they have including their 24-7 live stream. We hope you will [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3823.66s)]
*  I'm sorry. I've gone so far feel like but so your point is that [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3830.66s)]
*  Dispensationalism not only has [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3834.58s)]
*  Species theological elements, which I think very obviously it does. Yeah, by the way it it [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3837.9s)]
*  The whole theology was like [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3845.5s)]
*  Laid out in the end notes. It's not actually in the Bible. No like interpretation in the yeah [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3848.18s)]
*  I mean John Nelson Darby and Cyrus Goffield and it's and there's I mean they'll claim that they're [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3853.46s)]
*  Antecedents from the early church. Well, this guy believed in in something like the rapture and it's like [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3859.8399999999997s)]
*  It's always very like you say species. Yeah, I that's that's my read as a non theologian, but it does seem [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3865.2s)]
*  Incredibly silly but but sincere so yeah people. Yeah, exactly people sincerely believe it's 100% [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3871.92s)]
*  Lot of people I really like and respectfully. Yes, so I just want to say that [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3878.56s)]
*  But you're saying that the cost is even deeper because it changes your worldview [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3882.56s)]
*  And makes it very difficult for you to engage in the labor of like for example loving people around you and building something beautiful [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3888.78s)]
*  Which are also Christian imperatives is that yeah, I think so and it it also [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3896.34s)]
*  Yeah, so it it it forces you into into an immediacy, right? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3901.5800000000004s)]
*  We got to do everything right now because there isn't gonna be a future. Yes, there's not going to be I mean [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3906.82s)]
*  I heard this all the time growing up. Well, you know, we're not gonna be around [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3911.8s)]
*  We're gonna be raptured so why why plan for the future why build things for the future? Why? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3916.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, this was this was just everywhere in evangelicalism. Did you grow up in that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3921.7400000000002s)]
*  I did and I remember I [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3928.2200000000003s)]
*  Remember in college when I was first getting into more historical theology [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3931.66s)]
*  We're thinking like what people believe before the 19th century about things [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3936.08s)]
*  And [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3940.38s)]
*  The first 1800 years yeah, what what did they act well they were there various different eschatological schools [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3942.38s)]
*  Like there's all sorts of different views of how the end works [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3948.3399999999997s)]
*  But when I first get into that I'm thinking like I don't know if I actually believe in the rapture [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3952.8199999999997s)]
*  I remember being in college and in campus ministry and telling people this like I don't know if I actually believe in that [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3956.66s)]
*  I mean it was it was like I just uttered the greatest heresy of all time [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3961.54s)]
*  Like I could have said I probably could have said well, you know just denied the Trinity or something, right? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3967.6s)]
*  And they would have been like, oh, well, that's interesting but saying I don't think there's a rapture. What are you serious, right? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3973.48s)]
*  like that is central doctrine to many Christians and [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3980.12s)]
*  It has this deep, you know emotional connection because I mean if you've been if you've grown up your entire life hearing this and [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3985.0s)]
*  It's just assumed by everybody [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3992.08s)]
*  Right, it's hard to break out of that even though the everybody of the historic church of millions or billions of Christians [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=3994.0s)]
*  Right. It's actually a tiny minority in the history of the church that is believed that but presently [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4001.44s)]
*  It's a majority of evangelicals. Yeah, it seems like that theology is dying. That's just my sense [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4006.92s)]
*  But I'd be the last to really know no, I think your your instincts are correct [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4011.94s)]
*  I think some of it is I mean some of it too, especially in the latter half of the 20th century right after [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4016.12s)]
*  Right Israel is formalized as a state in 1948 [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4023.0800000000004s)]
*  Well that that gives like big confirmation that okay things are happening like there's an Israel in Revelation and a temple in Revelation [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4026.28s)]
*  So it's happening guys. So we've got 40 years, right? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4033.48s)]
*  1988 that's the end more than that doesn't happen and then people make all sorts of other guesses [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4037.7200000000003s)]
*  And it was I didn't was even aware of that. So the idea was 1988 same 40 years after [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4042.2000000000003s)]
*  1948 right that that's when the rapture is coming that was a you know [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4047.8s)]
*  I think it was there was a book like 88 reasons why Jesus is coming back in 1988, right? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4051.28s)]
*  And sure it sold a lot of copies and then of course didn't didn't happen. Um, wow [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4057.28s)]
*  But Mike Tkakas lost [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4063.32s)]
*  No, I mean that's not obviously the rapture but you know, whatever we'll take it for people in Massachusetts, maybe it was but [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4067.4s)]
*  but yeah, it's uh [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4075.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, it's just so interesting because like I look at it like you look at Matthew 24, right? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4077.7999999999997s)]
*  that's the big you know, the big text that people point to you and [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4083.6s)]
*  What does it say? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4088.56s)]
*  Where Jesus says well there, you know [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4089.68s)]
*  There's gonna be wars and rumors of wars and earthquakes in various places and plagues and things like that [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4091.56s)]
*  But right before it right what Jesus is in the temple and he's fighting with the chief priests and he's telling them [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4097.72s)]
*  You know, he's just he's fighting with them at Passover. So thousands of people surrounding them. He's embarrassing them in the temple and [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4105.44s)]
*  His boldness is really shocking. Yes people haven't read it before [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4113.24s)]
*  Yes, the rage that he displays at the leadership [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4117.839999999999s)]
*  Yes, the religious leadership is just like like it's nothing else [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4121.599999999999s)]
*  It comes right off the page and and which is so ironic because you see evangelicals who are like you need to be more Christ-like [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4125.92s)]
*  Right you need to be which means like wimpy and weak and inoffensive sweeping into the temple and knocking over tables and driving people [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4131.599999999999s)]
*  Out with a whip and then and then going into the temple and giving this parable [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4137.78s)]
*  Right where of the vineyard? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4141.799999999999s)]
*  He's like first I sent I sent this servant you beat him and stoned him and then you killed the other another one [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4144.12s)]
*  Well, I'll send my son and they'll respect him [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4151.92s)]
*  and then [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4155.599999999999s)]
*  It's the air right if we kill him we could take the vineyard for ourselves, right and yes [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4157.12s)]
*  what what's he gonna do to these people well, he's gonna he's gonna come and he's gonna destroy all of them and [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4162.0s)]
*  It's like and they knew right the hilarious thing I think like reading the Gospels is [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4167.5599999999995s)]
*  Right Jesus is giving parables and the point of the parables is actually to conceal what he's saying and people like well [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4174.36s)]
*  What's that even his own disciples like what what's that about? I don't really know I got it doesn't make any sense [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4180.24s)]
*  But he's telling parables to the chief priests and the Pharisees and all the leaders of Israel and they're like, oh [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4185.16s)]
*  That's about us. I think it says they understood it was about them. They knew and they decided to kill him [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4189.92s)]
*  Yeah, so they the parables are like obscured everybody else, but when it's about them like oh [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4194.860000000001s)]
*  He's talking about us right and and but but talk about speaking truth to power. I mean, yeah like yeah [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4200.28s)]
*  I don't know how that [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4207.96s)]
*  Jesus was kept for me as a [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4210.32s)]
*  You know lifelong churchgoer. I have no idea. Yeah, but you just read it [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4212.4s)]
*  I would recommend everyone read it non Christians alike, but he's there he's right there and especially the gospel of Matthew [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4216.96s)]
*  I love it because it is mark to all four [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4222.26s)]
*  I mean obviously all four of them like Matthew in particular is so cool to me [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4225.16s)]
*  because like you read it and the way it's organized is [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4230.2s)]
*  Jesus is recapitulating the entire history of Israel, right? So [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4234.16s)]
*  Right in the very beginning [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4238.84s)]
*  He he goes out into the wilderness for 40 days and 40 nights, right? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4240.4800000000005s)]
*  Just like Israel's in the wilderness for 40 years, right? It's tempted by Satan [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4244.42s)]
*  He comes right after after he crosses the dirt goes is baptized in the Jordan is like crossing the Red Sea [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4248.56s)]
*  Goes into the wilderness then after that, right? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4255.8s)]
*  He is he's preaching a sermon on a mountain expounding the law which is which is Moses on Sinai, right? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4258.9s)]
*  And after this he's telling parables of the kingdom like he's like he's David or like he's Solomon writing proverbs [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4265.7s)]
*  writing Psalms [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4272.62s)]
*  And then he begins all of these [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4274.179999999999s)]
*  excoriations of the high priesthood and the Pharisees and all the leaders of [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4277.42s)]
*  Israel well, what's that like this like the prophets, right? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4281.38s)]
*  So he's he's reliving the whole history of Israel in his his lifetime is what's Matthew doing there? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4284.12s)]
*  What's the Holy Spirit doing there? It's showing that Jesus is Israel, right? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4290.96s)]
*  He's the true Israel, right? He is the as as the Apostle Paul says he's the chosen seed of Abraham, right? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4294.58s)]
*  He's the one that carries out Israel's mission [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4300.7s)]
*  which is [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4303.78s)]
*  You just don't be I'm kind of doing the weave to be like like [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4304.94s)]
*  doing the weave [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4308.86s)]
*  It's it's Trumpian. It is [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4310.54s)]
*  People I mean when I'm preaching people are like Andrew you're doing the weave [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4312.86s)]
*  It's interesting I try not to do the hand motions and things like him too, but we all have our own rhetorical style [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4317.74s)]
*  but [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4324.54s)]
*  It's interesting because right like the whole dispensational thing where it's like, okay, right the old covenant still somehow sort of exists [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4326.94s)]
*  And there's still this, you know this distinction between Jew and Gentile out there [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4334.7s)]
*  Well, like the Holy Testament talks about this that no right those that that separation [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4339.9s)]
*  That existed in the old covenant, right? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4345.9s)]
*  They're brought together as one in Jesus who is the true Israel the true like that successful Israel the Israel that's obedient [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4348.26s)]
*  And goes to the death and is vindicated by being resurrected, right? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4356.5s)]
*  And and that that old covenant it's done. It's over right those distinctions between Jew and Gentile [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4360.5s)]
*  They're gone that only about a thousand times in every book of the New Testament [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4364.820000000001s)]
*  So to come to the opposite conclusion does make you sort of wonder like have you read it? Yeah, and [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4369.860000000001s)]
*  And [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4375.139999999999s)]
*  Exactly and and whether you believe it or not, that's just not what it says at all [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4376.34s)]
*  Yeah, and so you think about that and it's like, okay, these two are brought together [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4380.66s)]
*  I mean the whole book of acts is is about this right that the the the holy spirit not only goes to the apostles and [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4384.5s)]
*  the Jews in [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4391.0599999999995s)]
*  in Jerusalem [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4392.5s)]
*  But the Gentiles get it too like Peter goes to Cornelius [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4394.099999999999s)]
*  He believes and and now here is this roman right this Gentile and and the interesting thing about that too is there's this [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4397.0599999999995s)]
*  misconception [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4403.6s)]
*  That the only people in the Old Testament that believed in God were Jews [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4405.3s)]
*  But it's like everywhere they go [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4409.46s)]
*  There are these Gentile God fears that believe in God and Cornelius is one of them in the New Testament [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4410.98s)]
*  It's all through it's all through the New Testament. In fact, Jesus calls out repeatedly [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4416.74s)]
*  Yeah, Gentiles as the most faithful. Yes. He did Lee. Yes, the roman officer. Yes [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4421.86s)]
*  Yes again, like I mean he he says this in [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4428.26s)]
*  In the gospels like he's he's talking about right the faithful or faithless and adulterous generation, right? He's talking about israel [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4432.18s)]
*  and [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4439.3s)]
*  right, he's saying [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4440.18s)]
*  in in the resurrection, right [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4442.02s)]
*  Sodom and Gomorrah and Tyre and Sidon they'll they'll rise right right Sodom [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4445.14s)]
*  destroyed for trying to rape angels [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4450.58s)]
*  They will rise up in judgment on this generation because if the things that i'm doing right if the son of god appeared to them [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4453.22s)]
*  And preach to them. They would have repented right if [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4460.820000000001s)]
*  And and and Nineveh right this Gentile city in the Old Testament of Assyrians, right brutal bloodthirsty people [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4464.42s)]
*  right Noah shows up or [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4471.9400000000005s)]
*  Jonah shows up [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4474.18s)]
*  and [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4475.860000000001s)]
*  He he preaches and his only message is [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4477.06s)]
*  40 days Nineveh is going to be destroyed right? He's he's gleeful about this [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4480.58s)]
*  Uh, and the king hears about it. He he repents. He makes all the people in the city, um [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4485.860000000001s)]
*  Wear sackcloth and ashes and it's like well, I don't really know what's gonna happen. But this this looks serious [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4491.7s)]
*  Uh, we better repent [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4497.860000000001s)]
*  And and it I mean we're gonna go in the deep weeds here if you uh, let me you know [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4499.7s)]
*  this is i'm not filibustering like uh, like president putin did but uh, uh [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4504.42s)]
*  but uh, um [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4510.18s)]
*  Right you look at the book of Jonah in particular, um, he is he he flees [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4512.5s)]
*  Not because he's afraid of the assyrians, right? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4519.860000000001s)]
*  Like that's the what people think is like he's scared to go there [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4522.9800000000005s)]
*  No, like you read the end of the book of Jonah [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4526.5s)]
*  And he he's arguing with god at the end and he he's saying I knew [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4529.14s)]
*  That you would show mercy on these people, right? I knew you would show the mercy [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4534.34s)]
*  That's why I didn't want to go right he's trying to he was trying to outwit god like trick god into not [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4538.259999999999s)]
*  Being gracious to these gentiles [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4543.94s)]
*  because he knows [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4546.82s)]
*  in [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4548.58s)]
*  In the law right in deuteronomy, right? One of the signs that israel is about to be cursed [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4549.78s)]
*  Is that he is going to call nations, right? The gentiles right nations that do not know him to himself [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4555.379999999999s)]
*  He's going to go to the gentiles and away from israel [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4562.0199999999995s)]
*  And that means judgment is going to come upon israel. So [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4564.820000000001s)]
*  Jonah knows this he's like I am going the opposite direction. I'm going to tarshish to spain. Yeah, um [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4568.1s)]
*  Because I am not going to let god judge my people, right? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4573.9400000000005s)]
*  that's why he's angry about this and it gets even more interesting because [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4577.62s)]
*  Jesus talks about the sign of Jonah to israel [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4581.38s)]
*  And people think oh well Jonah's he's talking about the resurrection being in in the ground for three days and three nights [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4584.9800000000005s)]
*  and it's like [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4591.62s)]

*  All especially in tennessee like it's it's like here in florida [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4851.14s)]
*  Just exploding right so many people moving there because they're trying to get out of these places [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4855.62s)]
*  And and so what gets built right black rock style subdivisions and and just hideous buildings [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4861.46s)]
*  Yeah, and and very anti-human, right? And and so this is development that is is human scaled [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4867.94s)]
*  it's built for people to enjoy actual life, right for [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4874.099999999999s)]
*  for people to [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4878.74s)]

*  I'm so excited to be a part of it [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4923.46s)]
*  the fact that there's a church at the center of it is is a red flag for the authorities in most places and certainly for the [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4925.94s)]
*  cultural commentators and the [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4932.34s)]
*  Uh and and the media it was any other religious institution. Of course, it would be [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4934.82s)]
*  Be great that would be your cue other community praising the the muslim communities in texas, for instance [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4939.62s)]

*  I mean the bible says you're going to be persecuted for believing this so um, and they are [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=4952.099999999999s)]

*  So they're already they're already just distrusting of of that [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5002.42s)]
*  I'm like, oh it just seems like you really like donald trump and the united states and americans and [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5005.78s)]
*  The constitution and our freedoms and like you seem like a just normal, you know conservative [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5012.9s)]

*  Very kind, but the state legislature hasn't tried to [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5033.46s)]

*  There's no income tax in tennessee, uh, just like like florida [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5071.54s)]
*  And and so it's it's especially compared to large cities [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5075.54s)]
*  You know much much cheaper place to live. Uh, so a lot of people are like, oh wow [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5080.5s)]

*  The only ones working at these businesses like it will it will help [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5212.900000000001s)]

*  You know throughout the you know, because of macroeconomic forces geopolitical things [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5220.34s)]
*  Uh things that were done to our country all the manufacturing and and real good jobs that used to exist in a place like this [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5225.14s)]
*  Those are all [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5231.94s)]
*  Mostly gone. And so what would it look like if we brought those things back, right? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5233.139999999999s)]
*  How would it how would it bless the people in that area, right? That's that's a lot major part of it. Yeah [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5237.7s)]
*  and and so [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5244.5s)]
*  That's that's the exciting thing is [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5246.339999999999s)]
*  Well, we can we we come to a place like this [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5248.66s)]
*  We bring our our friends that have you know, some of them have remote jobs and and good incomes [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5252.099999999999s)]
*  um, they can [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5257.0599999999995s)]
*  They'll people will spend money locally and businesses will spring up because of that people will bring businesses and need employees and [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5258.5s)]
*  and the [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5266.26s)]
*  You know the people in the area will will flourish in a way that they haven't for for quite a while [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5267.86s)]
*  That's the pioneer spirit for people who are interested. What's the name of it this again? Uh ridge runner. So the highland rim project [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5273.78s)]
*  Highland rim project highland rim project. Yeah, so the website is [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5281.3s)]
*  Uh ridge runner usa.com [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5286.0199999999995s)]
*  Actually, yeah, so one last question for you. Do you expect I mean what you described in your home state in your hometown? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5288.66s)]
*  It's basically the persecution of christians the people have built the united states [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5296.1s)]
*  Um, and that is a trend. Do you expect where do you expect that trend to go to the extent you can predict it? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5300.26s)]
*  That's the most difficult thing. Of course always making predictions of course, but um, I I think it will go [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5306.18s)]
*  in in two directions [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5311.78s)]
*  So [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5313.94s)]
*  You know you have [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5314.9s)]
*  Uh the left. I mean you see this right now just how violent they are [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5316.34s)]
*  They're just itching to destroy things destroy people [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5319.62s)]
*  They're burning teslas. They're they're they they shot uh, president trump, right? They um, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5323.54s)]
*  They're very very very violent people and of course like the political apparatus on their side loves that right? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5330.9s)]
*  They never condemn it. They never say these things [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5336.259999999999s)]
*  Um, and we saw the same thing youth brigades. Yeah, they were militia in 2020 [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5338.9s)]
*  Right the same the same exact exact thing [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5343.14s)]
*  and so I think [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5346.26s)]
*  You know and there have been you know instances of churches being you know shot at and burned down and and bombed and things like this [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5347.860000000001s)]
*  I think those kind of things will [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5354.660000000001s)]
*  Will continue to happen and continue to get worse [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5357.620000000001s)]
*  Especially in blue states and blue cities where it's basically allowed, you know [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5360.5s)]
*  George soros just hand picks all the prosecutors and they're not going to [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5364.34s)]
*  enforce these laws, um [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5368.34s)]
*  And but on the flip side [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5370.900000000001s)]
*  they're [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5373.860000000001s)]
*  They're still like tens of millions of christians very conservative [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5375.06s)]
*  evangelicals and and the like [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5379.76s)]
*  uh, they [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5382.18s)]
*  They just got president trump elected, right? Um, and and political power is being [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5383.46s)]
*  wielded [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5389.4400000000005s)]
*  And that and that's always [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5390.5s)]
*  That's always the thing is like for so many years we were told [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5392.02s)]
*  um [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5396.660000000001s)]
*  That no no, no, we our enemies have all this political power, but we we're going to restrain ourselves [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5397.620000000001s)]
*  We're going to follow the constitution and we're just going to expect them to disarm themselves for reasons [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5402.18s)]
*  um and and that [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5408.5s)]
*  um, you know sort of way of thinking among conservatives is quickly being discarded that the only [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5410.9800000000005s)]
*  The only thing you could do is confront power with power, right? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5418.740000000001s)]
*  And and president trump and vice president vance. They're wielding power and and that wielding of power is going to defend [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5422.900000000001s)]
*  Christians in this country. Yes, it will and [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5430.64s)]
*  And so I I think like that conflict will continue to become more stark, right? The two visions for [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5433.9400000000005s)]
*  the country [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5440.9800000000005s)]
*  Will will become more black and white, right? It will become more obvious [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5442.740000000001s)]
*  that [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5448.18s)]
*  That christians need to band together [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5450.18s)]
*  to leave places where they have no protection whatsoever where people like tim wals or [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5453.38s)]
*  Or the the next governor of minnesota probably keith ellison who is an antifa muslim? Um [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5459.86s)]
*  Like they I mean that was a terrifying thing too. It's like this guy probably maybe he knows who I am [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5466.26s)]
*  And what what could that guy do to me, right? Um [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5470.66s)]
*  To leave a place like that where you will very likely be persecuted, right? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5474.9800000000005s)]
*  They want to have a foil like the whole thing on on christian nationalism [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5479.78s)]
*  I mean, this is why why I wrote a book on that is [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5483.46s)]
*  In 2022 the media is just attacking [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5486.42s)]
*  like normal decent evangelical people that happen to like donald trump and have skepticism about the election the vaccine everything and [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5488.98s)]
*  And make them the boogeyman and they would always say white christian nationalism [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5498.179999999999s)]
*  They always put those things together because they happen to be white and even though they espouse no [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5501.78s)]
*  white nationalist [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5506.82s)]
*  Tendencies at all. They have no race theology whatsoever whatsoever at all. Like they're they're like, wow, i'm totally colorblind [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5508.34s)]
*  They have a universalist. Yeah, absolutely [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5513.94s)]
*  Unlike the fascists who run the u.s media who are like nazi race mongers totally totally how many people of color? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5516.74s)]
*  We're gonna count you by race, which they literally do in this country. Who's the nazi? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5523.0599999999995s)]
*  I know I know that's they're obsessed with church. No people come to your church [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5528.099999999999s)]
*  Like how many blacks do we have today? How many hispanics? How many pacific islanders? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5531.86s)]
*  Don't you're like we have christians? Well, the evangelical leadership definitely does right they uh, well, they've fallen for this stuff [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5534.66s)]
*  Yeah, of course, but never forget how poisonous it is. Absolutely. Yeah, I think yeah it is it's like well [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5540.26s)]
*  No, we just have christians, right? Um, and so [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5546.58s)]
*  No, I think I think those those trends will continue and [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5550.02s)]
*  But i'm i'm hopeful i'm optimistic right i'm espousing this optimistic eschatology [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5554.58s)]
*  So of course i'm i'm optimistic i'm always [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5559.9400000000005s)]
*  always hoping for the very best and I think [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5563.06s)]
*  that especially if [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5567.14s)]
*  if the kind of um evangelical christianity, right historic [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5569.0599999999995s)]
*  christianity the the christianity that built christendom that built the west that built america [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5573.44s)]
*  If that comes back, right the kind of christianity that that sees jesus in the gospels like we were talking about earlier [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5578.74s)]
*  And sees a man right a man that is on a mission and is totally courageous [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5584.98s)]
*  and and [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5590.179999999999s)]
*  attacking [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5591.679999999999s)]
*  God's enemies right to their face knowing it's going to get him killed right that kind of [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5593.0599999999995s)]
*  christianity that preaches like that that speaks like that that that sees a god that is real and is is [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5599.12s)]
*  Is your god and he is [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5607.459999999999s)]
*  He he loves you and he he loves what's true and good and right and there's justice and he is going to bring justice [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5609.78s)]
*  To all of his enemies right to all the people that hate him all the people that that do just monstrous evil [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5618.5s)]
*  Right that kind of christianity that makes it come back in america. Well [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5624.82s)]
*  That's that's an america that has a future [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5628.66s)]
*  I have to say I think that the hallmarks of courage among them [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5632.419999999999s)]
*  are [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5636.5s)]
*  cheerfulness and optimism [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5637.44s)]

*  You have that oh, you know for a dangerous theocratic fascist you seem very optimistic and cheerful [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5641.94s)]

*  Yes, nice meeting you as well. Thank you [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5652.98s)]
*  So it turns out that youtube is suppressing this show on one level that's not surprising that's what they do [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5658.58s)]
*  But on another level it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now all the change taking place in our economy [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5664.179999999999s)]

*  Google has decided you should have less information rather than more and that is totally wrong. It's immoral [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5674.419999999999s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5682.179999999999s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5683.78s)]
*  We're not in charge of google or we could find a way around it a way that you could actually get information that is true [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5686.259999999999s)]

*  Actual news and information so we hope that you'll do that [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCOfT6UXEs&t=5705.86s)]
