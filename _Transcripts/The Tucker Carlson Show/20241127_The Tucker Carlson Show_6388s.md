# Dr. Mark Hyman Everything You're Eating Is Toxic, and Big Pharma Likes It That Way
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w)
*  So, okay, Bobby Kennedy, your longtime friend, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=0.0s)]
*  looks like he's gonna be the HHS secretary, assess. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4.08s)]
*  Did you think that was gonna happen in your lifetime? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=8.58s)]
*  Well, not in my lifetime, no. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=10.46s)]
*  Tucker, we're in this historic moment [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=11.92s)]
*  where America's waking up to the fact [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=14.92s)]
*  that it's been the frog in boiling water, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=17.96s)]
*  slowly getting sicker and sicker and sicker, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=20.22s)]
*  bankrupting our country with almost $5 trillion [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=23.8s)]
*  in healthcare costs, one $5 of our economy, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=26.44s)]
*  80% of it are more preventable, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=30.18s)]
*  99% of Medicare dollars are spent [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=32.08s)]
*  on preventable chronic disease, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  and never this conversation has happened [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=36.18s)]
*  in the political discourse until now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=38.78s)]
*  Which is a little crazy, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=40.78s)]
*  because you hear people talking about healthcare all the time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, they talk about healthcare as a way of like [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=43.82s)]
*  limiting entitlements or Medicare for all. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=45.52s)]
*  Exactly, everybody's upset about healthcare [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=47.16s)]
*  on some level for some reason, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=48.96s)]
*  but I haven't heard anybody until recently [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=50.46s)]
*  in the public sphere address why it's so expensive. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=52.46s)]
*  Right, so the question, I know, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=55.86s)]
*  I'm a functional medicine doctor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=57.3s)]
*  My focus is on why, what's the cause? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=58.94s)]
*  What's the root cause of the cause, the cause, the cause? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=61.94s)]
*  ["The Cause of the Cause"] [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=64.14s)]
*  Shouldn't that be every doctor? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=84.66s)]
*  Well, ideally, yes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=85.9s)]
*  I remember sitting in my office years ago, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=88.56s)]
*  and I had a diabetic patient come in, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=90.6s)]
*  I realized, you know, I can't cure diabetes in my office. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=92.06s)]
*  It's cured on the farm and the food we grow. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=94.2s)]
*  It's cured in the food manufacturing process. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=96.36s)]
*  It's cured by what people buy in the grocery store. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=99.24s)]
*  It's cured in the kitchen. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=102.3s)]
*  And so we really have to look at the root causes [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=103.84s)]
*  of our food system. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=105.84s)]
*  I said, why are my patients eating this food? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=107.14s)]
*  Well, it's because the food system. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=109.92s)]
*  Well, why do we have the food system we have [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=111.32s)]
*  and the way in which it's operating [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=113.38s)]
*  that drives this chronic disease epidemic, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=114.92s)]
*  which now is the biggest killer on the planet [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=116.94s)]
*  and is caused by food. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=120.54s)]
*  Food has outpaced smoking as the number one killer [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=121.58s)]
*  in the world. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=126.12s)]
*  It has 11 million people a year. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  11 million. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=128.66s)]
*  It's the biggest killer in the United States. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=129.48s)]
*  Why does that happen? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=130.72s)]
*  It's because our policies are driven in large part [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=131.72s)]
*  by industry, by the food industry, the ag industry, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=136.64s)]
*  chemical and seed companies. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=139.26s)]
*  And those are the companies that are profiting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=141.7s)]
*  This is the biggest industry in the world. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=143.7s)]
*  It's over $16 trillion when you aggregate [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=146.24s)]
*  all the food companies, the fast food companies, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=148.24s)]
*  the agricultural chemical and seed companies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  And this is enormous force [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  that's driving our political process. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=155.74s)]
*  And so a lot of the policies we have either by, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  you know, just kind of misalignment of our expectations [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=160.38s)]
*  and incentives of what happened, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=166.56s)]
*  or because of deliberate actions in the food companies [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=167.56s)]
*  have actually driven a food system that's making us sick. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  And we have an illness industrial complex. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=171.86s)]
*  We have a system that's driving disease [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=174.58s)]
*  and everybody's profiting from it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=177.36s)]
*  And no one's addressed that before. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=178.56s)]
*  And this is why we have the system. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=179.7s)]
*  So we're supporting commodity crops, wheat, corn, and soy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=181.06s)]
*  They get turned into ultra processed food, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=184.42s)]
*  which is basically chemical science projects [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=186.0s)]
*  that our bodies are not used to. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=187.74s)]
*  They're not technically defined as food. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=188.8s)]
*  Food is something that helps nourish a human being [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=190.56s)]
*  towards life and growth. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=194.14s)]
*  These things don't, they do the opposite. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=195.64s)]
*  They cause disease. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=197.14s)]
*  And so we sort of slowly get in this system [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=197.98s)]
*  where the enormous rise in chronic diseases [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=200.22s)]
*  that we've seen in the last 15 years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, Tucker, when I graduated medical school, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=205.12s)]
*  the cost for healthcare in America was half a trillion dollars. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=207.04s)]
*  Now it's almost 10 times that in my lifetime. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  When I graduated from medical school, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=212.28s)]
*  there was not a single state with an obesity rate over 15%. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  Now there's not one under 30, and almost all are over 40. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=216.2s)]
*  42% of Americans are obese. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  We've seen that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=221.92s)]
*  In all 50 states. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=222.76s)]
*  In all 50 states. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=223.6s)]
*  Yeah, we see, I mean, and you know what? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=224.44s)]
*  The highest diabetes mortality rates are in red states. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=225.92s)]
*  14 out of the 15 states with the highest [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=228.7s)]
*  diabetes mortality are red states. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  This is affecting everybody in America. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=232.16s)]
*  Doesn't matter whether you're red or blue or purple. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=234.32s)]
*  Biology is bipartisan. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=237.44s)]
*  You know, heart disease, cancer, dementia, diabetes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=239.32s)]
*  They don't know who you voted for. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=243.24s)]
*  What radicalized me was, so when I grew up, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=245.32s)]
*  I'm a little younger than you, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=247.9s)]
*  but you know, roughly the same generation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=249.12s)]
*  There were no fat people where I grew up, none. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=251.92s)]
*  Zero. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=253.72s)]
*  Half full in area, but still no fat people. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=254.56s)]
*  Zero fat people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=256.4s)]
*  And I always thought that it was like a failure of will. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=257.98s)]
*  It was a kind of sin. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=260.56s)]
*  It was blood and eating. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=262.12s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=262.96s)]
*  And then I came just from my own experience [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=263.8s)]
*  to realize that if you just go about your life [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=266.12s)]
*  as the way Americans do, just eat what's presented you, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=268.94s)]
*  and you don't make any effort to fight it, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=272.36s)]
*  if you just, sort of all things being equal, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  you're gonna be like 70 pounds overweight. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=278.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=280.0s)]
*  That happened to me. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=280.84s)]
*  I was like, wow, I'm gonna be super fat. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  If I don't really struggle all the time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=285.0s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=287.68s)]
*  Well, we make the hard choices, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=288.52s)]
*  the healthy choices, and the easy choices, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  the unhealthy choices. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=293.56s)]
*  So that, well that just, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=294.4s)]
*  it made me think that actually people who are obese [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=296.0s)]
*  are not the perpetrators, but the victims of the crime. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  This is really important, Tucker. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=303.08s)]
*  You just hit on something that is so critical, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=304.32s)]
*  which is that we have blamed the victim for this problem. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=306.88s)]
*  I have. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=310.08s)]
*  It's your fault you're fat, you're a glutton, you're lazy, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  and it's your fault. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=314.08s)]
*  So just stop eating that crap and get healthy, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=314.9s)]
*  and you'll save America. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=318.56s)]
*  Okay, so I kind of, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=320.0s)]
*  obviously we feel better to hear that, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=321.56s)]
*  but I think that's true. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=322.96s)]
*  It's absolutely true. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=325.36s)]
*  The NIH did an incredible study [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=326.2s)]
*  where they took a group of people, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=327.44s)]
*  and they fed them for two weeks a whole foods diet, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=329.2s)]
*  matched for protein, fat, carbs, fiber. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=331.58s)]
*  Then they fed them an ultra processed diet, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=333.7s)]
*  and they saw what happened to their biology. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=335.64s)]
*  The ultra processed food, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=337.96s)]
*  which is what 60% of our diet is, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=339.0s)]
*  it's 67% of kids' diet, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=341.0s)]
*  it's 73% of the food on our grocery store shelves. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=342.76s)]
*  When you eat that food, it dysregulates your appetite. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=345.44s)]
*  You eat 500 calories more a day in a week, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=348.26s)]
*  that's 3,500 calories. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=351.58s)]
*  3,500 calories equals a pound of weight gain. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=353.18s)]
*  In a year, that's 52 pounds. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=356.02s)]
*  So if Americans are eating this food, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=357.98s)]
*  which is everywhere, which is ubiquitous, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=359.3s)]
*  which we're marketed to death on. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=362.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, kids get targeted. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=363.96s)]
*  $14 billion, the food industry spends [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=366.94s)]
*  on marketing junk food to kids. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=370.34s)]
*  They see an average of 30,000 ads a year. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  You can talk to your kid, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=373.94s)]
*  and snacks about healthy food, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=376.53999999999996s)]
*  and you're not gonna beat the marketing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=377.76s)]
*  And this to me is criminal. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=379.56s)]
*  Most countries have banned this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=381.08s)]
*  Most countries don't allow this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=382.76s)]
*  And for example, Chile has gotten all the food marketing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=384.48s)]
*  to kids off between six in the morning and 10 at night. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=387.9s)]
*  They have no more Tony the Tiger on Frosted Flakes, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=390.56s)]
*  no more Toucan on the Fruit Loops. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=393.92s)]
*  Are you saying Frosted Flakes are a highly processed food? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  Of course they are. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=399.44s)]
*  I mean, I'm a cereal killer, to tell the truth. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=400.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you are. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=402.92s)]
*  I am a cereal killer. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=403.96s)]
*  I think cereal is the worst thing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=404.8s)]
*  I've ever invented for humanity. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=405.96s)]
*  It's basically 75% sugar. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=408.28s)]
*  It's sugar for breakfast. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=409.24s)]
*  It's dessert for breakfast. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=410.2s)]
*  That's not what we should be eating. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  And so what's happened is there are ways [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=412.64s)]
*  in which we are making it so easy [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=415.44s)]
*  for people to make the wrong choice. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=418.26s)]
*  And when you're exposed to these foods, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=419.4s)]
*  you're gonna gain weight. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=421.12s)]
*  You're gonna be dysregulated. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=421.96s)]
*  You're gonna destroy your microbiome. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=423.08s)]
*  You're gonna create inflammation. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=424.24s)]
*  You're gonna drive heart disease, cancer, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  diabetes, dementia, autoimmune diseases. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=426.64s)]
*  All these things are coming at explosive rates. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=428.84s)]
*  And I've looked at the data, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=431.0s)]
*  and even though we're spending more and more, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=432.56s)]
*  it'd be fine if we were spending $5 trillion [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=434.52s)]
*  and America was getting healthy. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=436.44s)]
*  It would be fine if we were spending $485 billion [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=438.36s)]
*  on drugs if they were working. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=440.4s)]
*  But for Tucker, the drugs that we're using [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=442.32s)]
*  for the disease that we have are not the right treatment. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=444.32s)]
*  The right treatment is changing what we're eating. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=446.76s)]
*  And if you look at heart disease, it's up 50%. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=448.92s)]
*  Cancer's up 30%, 60% higher in those under 50. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=451.12s)]
*  So we're seeing cancer rates rising in the young [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=455.4s)]
*  in rates we've never seen before. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=457.64s)]
*  Even though young people don't smoke cigarettes? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=458.72s)]
*  No, it's the food. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=460.24s)]
*  Colon cancer is the biggest thing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=461.32s)]
*  But it's just a little crazy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  Again, this is the benefit of being in your 50s [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=463.52s)]
*  because you sort of remember what the previous lies were. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=465.36s)]
*  But if we get rid of smoking, not endorsing smoking, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  then cancer's just gonna cease to exist. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=472.48s)]
*  Well, certain cancers like lung cancer [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=475.6s)]
*  and other cancers have gone down. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=477.48s)]
*  But when you see cancer rates increasing in children, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=479.16s)]
*  like by 30%, you see autoimmune diseases up 100%. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=482.36s)]
*  You see mental health issues up 80%. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=485.36s)]
*  You see autism up 1,000%. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=487.92s)]
*  ADD up 200%. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=490.12s)]
*  Diabetes up 400%. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=491.24s)]
*  Alzheimer's up 150%. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=492.6s)]
*  So we are screwing up here big time [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=494.56s)]
*  by not dealing with the root cause. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=496.76s)]
*  And we're spending on all those conditions [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=498.52s)]
*  two to 300% more on drugs. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=501.56s)]
*  So we're almost like, you know, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=503.68s)]
*  we're increasing by one or two fold these diseases [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=505.32s)]
*  and the drug use has gone up two or three fold. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=507.68s)]
*  And we're losing. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=509.84s)]
*  So if it was working, great, but it ain't working. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  And what's happening is that now most people don't realize it, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=514.12s)]
*  but that one of every dollars of your taxpayer dollars [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=516.84s)]
*  goes to fund our healthcare costs in America [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=519.24s)]
*  of that $4.9 trillion, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=522.64s)]
*  which was half a trillion when I graduated medical school, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=525.32s)]
*  that's paid for by the taxpayer and it's mostly preventable. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=528.32s)]
*  We're probably adding two trillion to our federal deficit [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=531.52s)]
*  every year because of this. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=533.44s)]
*  And also the amount of money we're spending [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=534.48s)]
*  is 40% of all healthcare bills. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  So if you look at the total healthcare bill, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=539.6s)]
*  when you add in everything in the government, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=542.16s)]
*  not just Medicare, but any health service, the military, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=543.48s)]
*  all federal employees, all the programs that are, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=546.12s)]
*  that the government is funding around healthcare, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=548.44s)]
*  it's 40% of the total healthcare bill in America [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=550.24s)]
*  is paid for by the US government. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  And we have enormous power to change [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  how those dollars are spent [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=557.96s)]
*  and how chronic disease is addressed in this country. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=559.1600000000001s)]
*  And for the first time, take this on [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=561.24s)]
*  and not just try to find the pill for every ill, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  but to get to the root cause. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=565.0s)]
*  And it's really from changing our food system [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=566.12s)]
*  from field to fork. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=568.2s)]
*  And it's addressing the conflicts of interest [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=569.44s)]
*  in government, it's addressing the NIH funding, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=571.32s)]
*  it's addressing what we pay for with food stamps, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=573.0s)]
*  there's so many areas that we have policy levers. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  So before we get into that, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  let's just define a couple of terms. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=578.5200000000001s)]
*  So when you say ultra-processed foods, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=579.84s)]
*  can you be precise? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=581.6s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=582.64s)]
*  So the NOVA classification, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=583.48s)]
*  and there's many different classifications [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=584.64s)]
*  for different kinds of food processing, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=586.0s)]
*  and there's pros and cons with each one. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=587.4s)]
*  So there's no perfect system. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=589.24s)]
*  But the NOVA classification was developed [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  by scientists in Brazil. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  It's now their standard of care for their food programs [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=593.72s)]
*  and dietary guidelines. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  So non-processed food is a tomato, an egg, an apple, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  an almond, you know what that is, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=601.36s)]
*  But if you make almond butter, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=602.96s)]
*  well, that's a little bit of minimally processed food. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=604.32s)]
*  If you make a can of tomatoes, that's minimally processed. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  That is another level of processing [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=608.44s)]
*  that you use in cooking. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=609.96s)]
*  It's a little more sort of processing of things, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=610.8800000000001s)]
*  but it's not made from anything [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=614.48s)]
*  other than real food ingredients. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  The fourth classification is ultra-processed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=618.4000000000001s)]
*  And this is essentially where they take commodity crops, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=620.84s)]
*  which are funded with our federal dollars, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  supporting farmers who are losing the game. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=626.12s)]
*  That's corn, soybeans. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=628.6400000000001s)]
*  Corn, soybean, and wheat. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=629.84s)]
*  And by the way, the farmers are suffering so bad. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=630.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, Tucker, there's a 350% higher rate of suicide [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  in farmers than there are in the rest of the population. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=637.92s)]
*  There's $435 billion of farmer debt [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=640.8s)]
*  that they carry to support us. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=643.52s)]
*  And they're stuck between the crop insurance [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=645.4s)]
*  that the government's paying, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=648.04s)]
*  the banks which are providing them the loans, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=649.04s)]
*  and the agrochemical and seed companies [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=652.92s)]
*  that are providing the fertilizer, the seeds, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=654.76s)]
*  and the chemicals that they're spraying on the farm. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=656.2s)]
*  And they can't get out of that toxic loop. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=658.04s)]
*  And they're struggling, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=660.36s)]
*  those rural communities are struggling so bad. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=661.68s)]
*  And that can be fixed. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=663.84s)]
*  So when you look at, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=664.68s)]
*  wait, shit, I lost my train of thought. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=667.64s)]
*  Ultra-processed foods. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, I was like, so- [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=669.56s)]
*  So processed is any food that's been changed [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=670.4s)]
*  in its composition. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=672.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=673.4799999999999s)]
*  So what happens is they're growing these commodity crops [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  that the government's basically supporting them funding [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=676.5999999999999s)]
*  of wheat, corn, and soy. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=678.8s)]
*  But you're not eating wheat berries or whole grain. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  You're not eating true whole soybeans. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=682.8s)]
*  You're not eating just corn on the cob. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=684.76s)]
*  These are deconstructed in factories, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=686.4799999999999s)]
*  in science, basically science labs, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=689.12s)]
*  into their molecular components are torn apart [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=691.0s)]
*  and rebuilt into these chemically extruded [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  food-like substances of all color, size, and shapes [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=698.16s)]
*  that are not by definition food. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=700.64s)]
*  If you look up the Webster's definition of food, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=702.56s)]
*  it's not actually technically food. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=705.0s)]
*  And so what most Americans are eating [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=707.16s)]
*  is stuff that actually is harmful, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=708.4799999999999s)]
*  that's causing disease and killing people. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=710.68s)]
*  It's literally, think about it, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=712.3599999999999s)]
*  the equivalent of two Holocausts a year [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=713.9599999999999s)]
*  are caused by the food we're eating [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=716.1199999999999s)]
*  according to the global burden of disease study. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  So how do you know it when you see it? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  You said 70% of our grocery store offerings [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=719.8s)]
*  are ultra-processed food. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=722.76s)]
*  The labeling, food labeling is a big issue [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=724.84s)]
*  and is one of our key initiatives, I think, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=726.0s)]
*  if we move forward in this administration, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=727.44s)]
*  it has to be addressed. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=729.36s)]
*  People need informed consent. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=730.44s)]
*  They need to be empowered with the right information. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=731.6400000000001s)]
*  They need to know what they're eating, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=733.48s)]
*  whether it's good or bad for them. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  And now you need to be a PhD scientist [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=735.88s)]
*  to read a nutrition label or read the ingredients [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=737.6400000000001s)]
*  and know what it means. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=739.32s)]
*  So you only have- [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  Right, so I avoid the Nilla wafers. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=741.4000000000001s)]
*  That's, I guess, the obvious one. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=742.6s)]
*  If you look at the ingredient list, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=744.2800000000001s)]
*  it should be stuff you know. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=745.6s)]
*  It should say tomatoes or salt or- [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=746.5200000000001s)]
*  So that's the measurement? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=748.88s)]
*  Yeah, if you see stuff like butylated hydroxy toluene, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=750.0s)]
*  it's probably not something you wanna be eating. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  And many of these chemicals that we use in America [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=754.88s)]
*  are outlawed in other countries, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=756.8399999999999s)]
*  in Europe and Singapore and many other countries. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=758.56s)]
*  These compounds that have been validated [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=762.12s)]
*  to show how harmful they are to human beings [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=764.68s)]
*  have been removed from the marketplace. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=766.88s)]
*  And we should follow those standards here. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=768.8s)]
*  So labeling is really key and we're gonna work on that. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=770.36s)]
*  But right now, if you're just trying to figure it out, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=773.24s)]
*  look at the ingredient list. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=775.76s)]
*  If there's stuff there that you wouldn't have [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=776.76s)]
*  on your kitchen counter or you wouldn't have [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=778.0s)]
*  in your pantry, don't eat it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=780.04s)]
*  If it says maltodextrin, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=781.8s)]
*  where's your maltodextrin jar in your spice jar? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=783.16s)]
*  Where's your butylated hydroxy toluene? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=785.68s)]
*  Do you sprinkle that on your salad? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=787.3599999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=788.7199999999999s)]
*  So if you don't understand it, don't eat it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=789.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=791.0s)]
*  I mean, things can have a long list of ingredients. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=792.0s)]
*  If you eat Indian foods, they have lots of spices. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=793.8s)]
*  That's fine, it's real food. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=795.76s)]
*  But if it's something that is in Latin [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=797.16s)]
*  that you don't understand, can't pronounce, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=800.56s)]
*  or it has a health claim on the label, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=803.0s)]
*  it's probably not good for you. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, like Lay's potato chips [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=805.16s)]
*  now says they're gluten-free. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=806.8s)]
*  I mean, that's ridiculous, right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=808.0s)]
*  Oh, it's gluten-free, it's healthy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=809.5999999999999s)]
*  No, it's not, you know? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=810.56s)]
*  Gluten-free cake. It's gluten-free [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=811.8s)]
*  because there's no wheat in it, right? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=812.64s)]
*  Of course, but Coca-Cola's gluten-free. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=813.7199999999999s)]
*  So like, my rule is if it has a health claim on the label, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=815.7199999999999s)]
*  don't eat it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  If there's a health claim on the label? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=819.68s)]
*  Yeah, but if it's low fat, high fiber, low cholesterol, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=820.5999999999999s)]
*  if it's no sugar, if it's gluten-free, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  it's hiding something. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=828.2399999999999s)]
*  They're hiding something, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=830.4799999999999s)]
*  It's just food. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=831.92s)]
*  I mean, tomato doesn't say gluten-free on it, right? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=832.76s)]
*  It's just a tomato. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=835.3199999999999s)]
*  So that, I mean, that limits your options. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=837.4799999999999s)]
*  You're gonna lose weight just from scarcity at that point. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=840.76s)]
*  You know what, it's amazing. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=843.24s)]
*  I had this view that it was people's fault they were fat. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  And I went down as part of this movie called Fed Up [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=846.56s)]
*  that I did with Katie Couric and Laurie David [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=849.4s)]
*  about 10 years ago. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=851.4399999999999s)]
*  We went to South Carolina, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=852.28s)]
*  and I went to Easley, South Carolina, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=853.5999999999999s)]
*  one of the poorest areas in America, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  one of the worst food deserts in America. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=857.8399999999999s)]
*  There's something called the Retail Environment Food Index, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=859.4s)]
*  how many fast food and junk food and bodegas there are [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=861.9599999999999s)]
*  compared to grocery stores. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  They're like 10 to one. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=866.52s)]
*  And this family of five lived in a trailer. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=868.16s)]
*  They were on disability and food stamps. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=871.16s)]
*  And they wanted to sort of get healthy. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=873.68s)]
*  And I asked them, why do you wanna get healthy? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=875.04s)]
*  Because I'm like, why do you wanna be in this movie? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=876.92s)]
*  They said, well, my dad's 42. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=878.64s)]
*  He has type two diabetes from the food he ate. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=881.32s)]
*  He has kidney failure. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=884.64s)]
*  He's on dialysis. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=885.64s)]
*  He's gonna die unless he loses 40 pounds. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=886.56s)]
*  And we can't get him to lose 40 pounds. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=888.84s)]
*  We don't know what to do. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=890.16s)]
*  The mother was well over 150 pounds overweight. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=891.56s)]
*  The son was 16 years old, almost diabetic, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=894.64s)]
*  50% body fat. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=897.96s)]
*  It should be 10 to 20%. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  I said, rather than giving a lecture [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=900.88s)]
*  about what to do and what to eat, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=902.84s)]
*  I said, let's go to your house. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=903.96s)]
*  Let's go shopping, get some simple foods [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=905.44s)]
*  that are inexpensive, that are whole foods [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=907.72s)]
*  that are healthy to eat. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=910.12s)]
*  So we made turkey chili. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=910.96s)]
*  This was from Good Food on a Tight Budget, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=912.4s)]
*  a guide from the Environmental Working Group. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=914.44s)]
*  I said, here's turkey chili. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=915.76s)]
*  Here's how to roast some sweet potatoes. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=917.16s)]
*  Here's how to fry asparagus. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=918.9200000000001s)]
*  Here's how to make a salad from not just iceberg lettuce, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=920.12s)]
*  but some real lettuce. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=922.6800000000001s)]
*  Here's olive oil and vinegar dressing. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=923.96s)]
*  Is iceberg is not real lettuce? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=925.3199999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=926.64s)]
*  It's pretty much a nutritionally vapid food. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=927.48s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=931.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's fine if you want to eat it, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=932.24s)]
*  but it's not fully dense with phytochemicals and nutrients. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=933.9599999999999s)]
*  And so we basically showed them, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=938.9599999999999s)]
*  and I went through their cupboards, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=941.0799999999999s)]
*  everything in their cupboard. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  They had low fat this and cool whip. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=943.3199999999999s)]
*  They thought it was healthy because it said no trans fats, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=945.88s)]
*  but the FDA with the inclusion with the food industry [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=947.8s)]
*  allowed a food to say no trans fats [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=950.8399999999999s)]
*  that have less than half a gram per serving. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=953.24s)]
*  So basically they're just duping the American public. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=955.2800000000001s)]
*  And we need clear transparency and information. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=957.9200000000001s)]
*  So they didn't know what they were eating [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=960.32s)]
*  and everything was frozen or packaged or canned or boxed. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=961.84s)]
*  They never cooked anything. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=964.96s)]
*  They didn't have cutting boards. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=965.88s)]
*  They didn't have knives. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=966.72s)]
*  They never cooked anything in their kitchen. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  And so we made turkey chili. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=969.36s)]
*  We made this whole meal. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=970.32s)]
*  We sat down and ate it and it was so delicious. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=971.2800000000001s)]
*  And the son goes, Dr. Hyman, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=972.96s)]
*  do you like this for your family? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=974.48s)]
*  Every night I'm saying, yeah, I do. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=975.5200000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't hard. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=976.6800000000001s)]
*  It wasn't difficult. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=977.72s)]
*  It didn't take much time. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  And I said, listen, you know, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=980.24s)]
*  I don't know if you can do this, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=981.88s)]
*  but here's this guide on how to eat well for less. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=983.52s)]
*  Here's my cookbook on how to actually eat healthy [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=985.6s)]
*  and try it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=989.5600000000001s)]
*  And on the plane, I sent them cutting boards and knives [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=990.6s)]
*  because they didn't have anything to cut. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=993.2s)]
*  I mean, we're cutting like with a butter knife [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=995.6s)]
*  trying to cut sweet potatoes. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=997.52s)]
*  It was ridiculous, hard sweet potatoes. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=998.5600000000001s)]
*  They had no utensils in there. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1000.2s)]
*  Nothing, not for cooking, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1001.24s)]
*  And so the first week the mother texted me back, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1003.44s)]
*  she said, Mark, we lost 18 pounds. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1005.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm like, amazing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1006.6s)]
*  And a year they lost over 200 pounds as a family. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1007.76s)]
*  The father lost 45, got a new kidney. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1009.5600000000001s)]
*  The mother lost 100 plus pounds. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1011.68s)]
*  The son lost 50, but he went to work at Bojangles. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1013.4799999999999s)]
*  And gained it back. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  He said it was like putting an alcoholic to work in a bar. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1017.8s)]
*  And then he gained all the weight back. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1020.28s)]
*  And then he called me a few years later, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1023.04s)]
*  he said, Mark, can you help me? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1025.24s)]
*  I always said Dr. Hyman, but yeah. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1026.08s)]
*  I said, yeah. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1027.8s)]
*  And so I coached him and guided him. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  He lost 132 pounds. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1029.84s)]
*  And he's the first kid in his family to go to college. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1031.76s)]
*  He wrote me a letter. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1034.36s)]
*  He said, Mark, can you write me a letter recommendation [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1035.2s)]
*  for medical school? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1037.52s)]
*  And now he's a doctor. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1038.36s)]
*  So, and now he lost all that weight. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1040.04s)]
*  What that taught me was that it's really about education, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1042.36s)]
*  about information, about skills. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1046.24s)]
*  I don't know if you know this story, but in the night- [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1048.8s)]
*  Wait, but hold on, hold on. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1050.44s)]
*  There's, yes, but you can know the right path [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1051.52s)]
*  and not take it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1054.8s)]
*  There's a compulsion attached to certain kinds of food. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1055.6399999999999s)]
*  100%. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1059.0s)]
*  And this is well-documented, Tucker. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1059.84s)]
*  It is well-documented. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1061.72s)]
*  Well-documented. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1062.56s)]
*  And these studies are published. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1063.4s)]
*  There was a large study published [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1064.24s)]
*  reviewing all the literature on food addiction. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1065.6s)]
*  And there's something called the Yale Food Addiction Scale, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1067.24s)]
*  which is questions you can look up online. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1069.48s)]
*  You just answer the questions, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1071.72s)]
*  and it tells you if you're a food addict, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1073.16s)]
*  just so that you can do a question [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1074.76s)]
*  or tell if you're an alcoholic. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1075.8s)]
*  It's 14% of the adult population are alcoholics. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1077.4s)]
*  14% of people are food addicted, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1080.24s)]
*  and 12% of children are food addicted, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1082.16s)]
*  by the scientific definition of food addiction. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1084.56s)]
*  Not just, oh yeah, this is addictive, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  but actually biologically addictive, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1089.08s)]
*  measuring the things you need to measure [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1091.0s)]
*  to determine addiction. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1093.92s)]
*  And so if that's true, you say compulsion, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1095.24s)]
*  but it's really a hijack of our biochemistry. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1097.68s)]
*  So the food industry has designed foods [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1100.8s)]
*  to hijack our biology. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1102.76s)]
*  There's a book written by Michael Moss [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1104.28s)]
*  called Salt, Sugar, and Fact, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1106.0s)]
*  where he interviewed 300 food industry executives [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  and whistleblowers and scientists. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  And basically they said, look, we have taste institutes [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1111.4s)]
*  where we hire craving experts, these are their own terms, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1114.28s)]
*  to create the bliss point of food, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1117.0800000000002s)]
*  which is the maximum lighting up of your brain. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1118.8400000000001s)]
*  And then we go for targeting marketing to heavy users. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
*  So they're not gonna get me to drink a can of Coke, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1125.8s)]
*  but they're gonna get someone who's already having Coke [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1128.56s)]
*  to try to drink a two liter bottle, right? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1130.28s)]
*  And they know how to do that. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1132.1599999999999s)]
*  And so the effects of these foods are so harmful on us, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1133.44s)]
*  and they know what they're doing, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1137.8799999999999s)]
*  and they actually designed them to be this way. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1139.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, the tobacco companies bought a lot [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1142.24s)]
*  of the food companies back in the 70s, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1144.48s)]
*  RJR Nabisco, Fillmore's Craft, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1146.0s)]
*  and they built this whole industry of ultra processed food. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1148.08s)]
*  There's now 600,000 ultra processed food products. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1151.3999999999999s)]
*  80% of them are full of sugar, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1154.04s)]
*  and they're the things that are driving most of the things [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1155.92s)]
*  that are wrong with America. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1159.08s)]
*  If you look at food, it's the nexus for everything. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  One, obviously chronic disease, all the things we mentioned, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1162.84s)]
*  heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1165.12s)]
*  autoimmune diseases, I mean, just digestive disease, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1168.84s)]
*  all the things, depression, mental health now is linked to, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1171.0s)]
*  ultra processed food, there's really well documented science [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1173.52s)]
*  on this, that these foods cause depression, anxiety. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1175.96s)]
*  So we have all these foods that are causing disease. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1179.76s)]
*  Then we have the economic burden, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1184.08s)]
*  which we talked about, almost $5 trillion. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1185.16s)]
*  We have the effect on national security, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1188.32s)]
*  because 77% of military recruits are rejected [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1189.84s)]
*  because they're unfit to fight. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1192.2s)]
*  So we have a national security crisis, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1193.24s)]
*  and 72% more evacuations were for obesity [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1194.8799999999999s)]
*  compared to war injuries from Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1199.24s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1201.6s)]
*  In a war, more soldiers were evacuated because of obesity [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1203.0s)]
*  than because of war injuries. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1206.3999999999999s)]
*  Academic performance, we're 30th something in the world [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1209.04s)]
*  in math and reading. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1211.4399999999998s)]
*  We are, where kids are suffering, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1212.76s)]
*  our kids are on ADD medications. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1215.1999999999998s)]
*  So food makes you dumber, certain kinds of things. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1217.36s)]
*  100%, makes you cognitively impaired, behavioral issues. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1219.32s)]
*  I mean, there was one study, Tucker, where they took kids [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1222.8s)]
*  in juvenile detention centers, and they gave them healthy [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1225.76s)]
*  food, swapped it out for the junk food. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1228.52s)]
*  97% reduction in behavioral issues and violence, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1230.4399999999998s)]
*  75% reduction in restraints, and 100% reduction in suicides, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1233.48s)]
*  which is the third leading cause of death [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1238.2s)]
*  in teenage boys. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1239.68s)]
*  This is documented science. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1241.0800000000002s)]
*  This is not stuff I'm making up. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1242.92s)]
*  And it's, oh, I wrote in my book, Food Fix, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1244.2s)]
*  which is really how to save our health, our economy, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1246.04s)]
*  our communities, and our planet one by at a time. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1248.48s)]
*  And it talks about the nexus of all these issues. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1250.28s)]
*  And then we have the effect on our soil. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1252.92s)]
*  We've lost so much soil carbon. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1255.8s)]
*  Soil has to be healthy to grow a healthy plant, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1257.64s)]
*  and a healthy plant is what creates healthy humans. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1260.04s)]
*  And the nutrients in plants have gone down by 50%. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1262.2s)]
*  So even if you're eating your broccoli, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1264.4s)]
*  it's less nutritious than it was 50 years ago. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1265.88s)]
*  She got to eat twice as much. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1268.44s)]
*  That's right, maybe. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1269.76s)]
*  Yeah, you can do that. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1270.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1272.4s)]
*  The best Christmas presents are the ones [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1273.24s)]
*  that you would give yourself. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1275.16s)]
*  Well, this Christmas, we were recommending a gift [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1276.52s)]
*  that we do give ourselves, meat from Merryweather Farms [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1278.44s)]
*  in Wyoming. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1282.2s)]
*  So about six months ago, we'd interviewed a bunch [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1283.0400000000002s)]
*  of different health specialists, doctors and nutritionists, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1285.44s)]
*  about food in the United States. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1288.28s)]
*  And the consensus is, it's not very good, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1290.3600000000001s)]
*  particularly the meat. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1292.92s)]
*  So we decided, let's search across the country [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1293.76s)]
*  and find a source of good, clean, tasty meat. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1295.84s)]
*  Not all of it tastes very good, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1300.08s)]
*  the clean stuff, by the way. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1301.44s)]
*  So after trial and error, we settled on our all-time [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1303.28s)]
*  favorite, Merryweather Farms. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1305.6399999999999s)]
*  And we really settled on it. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1307.6399999999999s)]
*  So every time we have dinner with a guest before the show, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1309.36s)]
*  which is often, we serve the exact same thing, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1311.32s)]
*  steaks from Merryweather Farms. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1314.52s)]
*  And every single time, they've been excellent. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1316.12s)]
*  Every guest has loved them. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1318.32s)]
*  We eat them at home and at work, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1320.04s)]
*  so we can recommend this with total heartfelt sincerity. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1322.48s)]
*  And this year, Merryweather Farms makes it very easy [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1326.0s)]
*  for you to send their meat as a gift. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1329.2s)]
*  They've got all kinds of gift boxes. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1331.56s)]
*  They're famous steaks, including Wagyu beef, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1333.56s)]
*  roasts, burgers, hot dogs, beef sticks, snacks, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1336.26s)]

*  And then, you know, we have also the effect on biodiversity [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1364.28s)]
*  because of all the chemicals we're using. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1367.92s)]
*  We have 75% less pollinators. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1368.96s)]
*  No pollinators, you know, it's hard to have agriculture. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1370.5600000000002s)]
*  We have a 50% loss in bird species [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1373.38s)]
*  from the way we're growing food. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1375.4s)]
*  We have the destruction of our waterways [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1376.24s)]
*  because we use fertilizer that runs off into the rivers [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1378.8s)]
*  and lakes and streams and causes eutrophication, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1381.28s)]
*  which basically grows algae because of the extra fertilizer [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1383.72s)]
*  and then sucks all the oxygen out of the water [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1387.56s)]
*  and all the fish die. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1389.4s)]
*  There's dead zones the size of New Jersey [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1390.32s)]
*  in the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1391.92s)]
*  There's 400 around the planet [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1392.92s)]
*  that feed half a billion people. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1394.28s)]
*  So this is all from the fertilizers, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1395.92s)]
*  which uses actually 2% of the world's global energy [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1397.84s)]
*  to make fertilizer. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1400.26s)]
*  But you don't need to do that [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1401.24s)]
*  if you use regenerative agriculture, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1402.28s)]
*  which is actually one of the things [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1403.56s)]
*  that I think this new administration should focus on, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1405.24s)]
*  which is how do you fix the farming? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1407.16s)]
*  Because you've got to start at the field to fix food. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1408.68s)]
*  And, you know, I think Wendell Berry said it beautifully. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1411.1200000000001s)]
*  He's a poet and a farmer. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1413.76s)]
*  Amazing man. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1415.64s)]
*  Amazing man, he said, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1416.48s)]
*  we have a health system that pays no attention to food [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1417.3s)]
*  and a food system that pays no attention to health. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1419.86s)]
*  We need to fix that. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1422.5s)]
*  So you've referred a couple of times [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1423.34s)]
*  to the connection between what we eat and cancer rates. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1424.88s)]
*  Can you be a lot more precise about that? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1429.2s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely, yeah. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1431.04s)]
*  So the data's really clear. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1431.88s)]
*  You want to scare people into eating better. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1432.72s)]
*  Cancer's a good way to do it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1434.24s)]
*  Well, you know, cancer is on the rise. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1435.48s)]
*  And we've got to- [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1437.8s)]
*  I just can't get over that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1439.36s)]
*  I thought we were going to defeat it [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1440.2s)]
*  with our war on cancer. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1441.02s)]
*  Yeah, well, that was Nixon. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1441.86s)]
*  He wanted to, but the problem is [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1442.7s)]
*  we're barking up the wrong tree. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1444.76s)]
*  And if you look, there's a real clear data [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1446.24s)]
*  on two drivers of cancer. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1449.56s)]
*  One is food, and particularly sugar and starch. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1451.72s)]
*  And two is environmental toxins, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1455.64s)]
*  it's carcinogens, which are ubiquitous. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1457.72s)]
*  We're exposed to toxins everywhere, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1459.38s)]
*  and we can reduce those. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1461.8s)]
*  But the food part is really interesting, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1462.76s)]
*  because when you look at the growth of cancer cells, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1465.6s)]
*  they feed on sugar. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1468.16s)]
*  There's a whole metabolic theory of cancer [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1469.8799999999999s)]
*  where if you use a ketogenic diet, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1471.3799999999999s)]
*  and this is work being done at Columbia [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1473.48s)]
*  by Sid Mukherjee and others, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1475.24s)]
*  ketogenic diets as a treatment for cancer [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1477.28s)]
*  to actually shut down the cancer cells, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1479.94s)]
*  because they can only feed on sugar. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1482.04s)]
*  We are like a hybrid engine. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1484.36s)]
*  We can go electric or we can go gas. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1486.02s)]
*  We can go carbs, we can go fat. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1488.16s)]
*  Cancer only goes sugar. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1490.16s)]
*  So you start with sugar, and you kill the cancer. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1491.64s)]
*  So the amount of sugar and flour eating [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1494.0800000000002s)]
*  is about 152 pounds of sugar per person per year, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1496.0800000000002s)]
*  and 133 pounds of flour. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1499.8400000000001s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1502.16s)]
*  That's almost three quarters of a pound a day [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1503.0s)]
*  of sugar and flour for every American. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1504.0400000000002s)]
*  And what that does is it fuels the cancer cells. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1506.48s)]
*  And so pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1508.8400000000001s)]
*  uterine cancer, prostate cancer, even some lung cancers. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1511.4s)]
*  And the data is documented, go up with some resistance, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1514.5600000000002s)]
*  go up with obesity and go up with diabetes [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1518.28s)]
*  and metabolic dysfunction. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1521.72s)]
*  93% of Americans, Tucker, are metabolically broken. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1523.2s)]
*  This is extraordinary from the American Journal of Cardiology. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1527.3s)]
*  And what this means is that we're somewhere on the degree [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1530.92s)]
*  of what I call diabecity. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1533.92s)]
*  Diabecity is pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1535.44s)]
*  And we cut off at pre-diabetes, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1538.48s)]
*  but that's one in two Americans has pre-diabetes [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1540.62s)]
*  or type 2 diabetes. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1543.08s)]
*  That's bad enough. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1543.92s)]
*  38% of teenage boys. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1544.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, when I graduated medical school, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1546.44s)]
*  there was no type 2 diabetes. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1548.9599999999998s)]
*  There was no type 1 diabetes. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1549.8s)]
*  It was juvenile diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  or adult diabetes, which is a foodborne disease. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1553.52s)]
*  And so now we've changed the names to protect the guilty. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1556.6399999999999s)]
*  And so now we see kids. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1559.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1560.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, three. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1561.52s)]
*  The names were changed to mask the cause of type 2. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1562.36s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, because kids are getting it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1565.9199999999998s)]
*  So how do we call juvenile diabetes [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1568.08s)]
*  if kids are getting type 2 diabetes [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1570.76s)]
*  as young as two or three years old? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1572.32s)]
*  It's not their fault. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1573.9199999999998s)]
*  They're being fed soda. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1574.76s)]
*  I once was working in an urgent care in California [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1576.44s)]
*  in an underserved community. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1579.68s)]
*  And this woman comes in with back pain. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1580.68s)]
*  She's got a baby in her baby carriage [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1581.88s)]
*  and he's drinking this brown liquid. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1583.56s)]
*  And I'm like, what is this? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1584.96s)]
*  Seven months old. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1585.8s)]
*  I'm like, what is that? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1586.6200000000001s)]
*  It's Coca-Cola. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1587.46s)]
*  I'm like, why are you drinking baby Coca-Cola? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1588.3s)]
*  She's like, he likes it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1589.64s)]
*  I mean, this is what's happening. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1590.88s)]
*  And so we're turning our whole society [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1591.88s)]
*  into this metabolically broken society. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1594.96s)]
*  And this is the driver of all the diseases we're seeing. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1597.16s)]
*  Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, dementia. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1599.64s)]
*  They're calling Alzheimer's type 3 diabetes [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1601.48s)]
*  because of how it's connected to sugar [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1604.0s)]
*  and it's a lot of resistance. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1606.76s)]
*  And I co-founded a company called Function Health, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1607.6000000000001s)]
*  which allows people to get insights into their own biology. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1609.24s)]
*  And what we're finding Tucker is that 96% [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1612.2s)]
*  of the people we're testing have metabolic dysfunction. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1615.0800000000002s)]
*  96%. 96, yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1618.3200000000002s)]
*  So how do you get insight into your own biology? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1619.76s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1621.8000000000002s)]
*  So basically, healthcare system is broken. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1622.64s)]
*  And I believe that I could work for another 50 years [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1625.52s)]
*  and maybe I'm wrong. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1628.44s)]
*  Maybe with this new administration, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1629.26s)]
*  we'll leapfrog and things will change. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1630.4s)]
*  Which I'm very hopeful for. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1631.8400000000001s)]
*  But I created a company with a number of other co-founders [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1633.16s)]
*  called Function Health that allows you easy access [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1636.0400000000002s)]
*  to your own blood test. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1638.44s)]
*  It is simple, five minutes to sign up, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1640.5600000000002s)]
*  15 minutes to go into a Quest Lab to get your labs drawn. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1643.3200000000002s)]
*  You get over 110 biomarkers or lab tests. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1645.72s)]
*  It gives you insight into everything that's going on [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1648.44s)]
*  in your body that you're not being checked for [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1650.0400000000002s)]
*  at your regular doctor's office. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1651.44s)]
*  You get five times more diagnostics. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1652.76s)]
*  You look at your hormones, your metabolic health, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1654.44s)]
*  your cardiovascular health, your nutritional health. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1656.2s)]
*  I mean, your immune health. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1658.28s)]
*  We've seen 46% of Americans have some degree [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1660.76s)]
*  of autoimmunity, which is crazy. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1663.16s)]
*  It's one of the biggest cost drivers. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1665.0s)]
*  Whether it's thyroid autoimmunity [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1666.52s)]
*  or other autoimmunity or pre-autoimmunity. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1667.72s)]
*  We're seeing 67% have nutritional deficiencies. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1670.2s)]
*  And these are the lab reference ranges that are Quest. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1673.2s)]
*  These are not what I would think are optimal. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1675.76s)]
*  So vitamin D, for example, should be over 50, 45, 50. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1678.12s)]
*  The reference range is 30. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1682.6s)]
*  But still, we've got a huge amount of people [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1683.84s)]
*  deficient at that level. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1685.76s)]
*  And when you're under 30, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1687.04s)]
*  your risk of getting sick and dying of COVID [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1687.8799999999999s)]
*  is 70% higher. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1691.2s)]
*  If your vitamin D is over 50, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1692.04s)]
*  your risk of death is zero. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1693.28s)]
*  Compared to looking at these. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1694.52s)]
*  We could just ask a dumb question. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1695.36s)]
*  No dumb question. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1697.0s)]
*  So a basic question. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1697.84s)]
*  So you get blood. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1700.24s)]
*  Your company does this. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1701.44s)]
*  Maybe others do it, but you get a blood test. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1702.88s)]
*  You get all these markers, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1705.36s)]
*  all these measurements of what's in your blood. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1706.24s)]
*  How do you know what they mean? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1708.0s)]
*  Well, that's a great question. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1709.76s)]
*  So we really use the technology [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1710.6s)]
*  to help us build a database [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1714.4s)]
*  of the most up-to-date scientific information [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1716.6s)]
*  formed by all the scientific literature. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1719.2s)]
*  And you have a clear description [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1721.3200000000002s)]
*  of what every biomarker means. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1722.8400000000001s)]
*  So if your insulin or blood sugar [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1724.0s)]
*  or your cholesterol particles are abnormal [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1726.0400000000002s)]
*  or you have positive autoimmune antibodies, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1727.88s)]
*  we tell you what it means, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1729.8000000000002s)]
*  why it happens, what the root causes are, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1731.28s)]
*  not necessarily just what traditional medicine thinks, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1733.72s)]
*  but what the new science thinks around root causes. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1735.68s)]
*  We give you all the self-care things you can do yourself [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1739.0800000000002s)]
*  to optimize your health. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1742.3200000000002s)]
*  So you can upgrade your biology [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1743.16s)]
*  with insights from scientific literature, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1744.44s)]
*  from knowledge experts. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1746.76s)]
*  We've brought in the top scientists and doctors [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1747.72s)]
*  to help inform the content. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1750.0s)]
*  So it's like having a thousand doctors in your pocket. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1751.6000000000001s)]
*  Remember the iPod was a thousand songs in your pocket? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1753.6000000000001s)]
*  This is a thousand doctors in your pocket. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1755.88s)]
*  And it gives you the ability to do self-care. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1757.64s)]
*  And like I said, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1760.0s)]
*  diabetes isn't cured in the doctor's office, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1761.1200000000001s)]
*  it's cured in the kitchen. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1762.88s)]
*  And that's really what most chronic diseases can be fixed. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1764.1200000000001s)]
*  And I see this over and over after doing it for 30 years. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1766.84s)]
*  I've written almost 20 books. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1769.52s)]
*  And what I see is when people follow the guidance [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1771.0s)]
*  without having to go to the healthcare system, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1773.48s)]
*  they can correct these things [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1775.72s)]
*  and they can fix these things. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1777.0s)]
*  Really? Yes. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1778.04s)]
*  It's quite amazing, Tucker. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1779.28s)]
*  And by these things, diabetes famously. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1780.6s)]
*  Diabetes reversible, heart disease reversible, Alzheimer's. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1782.68s)]
*  Now Richard Isakson has done amazing work [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1785.28s)]
*  showing how we can reverse Alzheimer's [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1787.36s)]
*  using aggressive lifestyle interventions. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1789.88s)]
*  But- What? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1792.4s)]
*  Yes, this is incredible data. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1793.48s)]
*  Well, I just wanna speak up as a non-doctor. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1795.72s)]
*  We know for a fact that Alzheimer's is incurable. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1797.4s)]
*  Nothing can make it better. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1799.76s)]
*  Well, that's actually not true. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1801.2s)]
*  I know, but I've been told that a lot. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1803.4s)]
*  So I'm just- Of course, of course. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1804.44s)]
*  Because we've spent, this is a great example. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1805.56s)]
*  We've spent about $2 billion and over 400 studies [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1808.32s)]
*  trying to find drugs for Alzheimer's [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1812.48s)]
*  and nothing has worked. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1814.08s)]
*  The drugs that are approved are extremely expensive, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1815.28s)]
*  have marginal benefit, a lot of side effects [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1817.2s)]
*  and cost a huge amount of money [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  and may delay your entry into nursing home [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1820.84s)]
*  by two or three months. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1822.6s)]
*  That's a win. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1823.56s)]
*  That's not very good. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1824.8s)]
*  Now there's a couple of trials that have been done. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1825.6399999999999s)]
*  The finger trial out in Europe [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1827.48s)]
*  and the pointer trial, which is emerging, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1828.84s)]
*  that showed aggressive lifestyle intervention, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1830.52s)]
*  diet, exercise, managing stress, sleep, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1832.8799999999999s)]
*  optimizing all your risk factors, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1835.6399999999999s)]
*  was able to not just slow the progression of Alzheimer's [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1837.72s)]
*  and dementia, but to reverse it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1840.3999999999999s)]
*  This is published data. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1842.08s)]
*  This is not my opinion. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1843.1999999999998s)]
*  Richard Isaacson also has published this data. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1844.4399999999998s)]
*  And now using biomarkers, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1846.6799999999998s)]
*  and we can actually test with function, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1848.8799999999999s)]
*  soon we'll be adding biomarkers for Alzheimer's. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1850.48s)]
*  So now there's blood tests for Alzheimer's. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1852.84s)]
*  So you don't have to wait until you forget your keys. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1855.9199999999998s)]
*  And also for cancer, you're asking about cancer, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1857.8s)]
*  we do a multi-cancer- [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1859.6799999999998s)]
*  So you can see it at what age is Alzheimer's detectable [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1860.6s)]
*  in the blood test? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1862.84s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1863.6799999999998s)]
*  So on imaging, which is very expensive and difficult. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1864.5s)]
*  Brain imaging. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1868.12s)]
*  Yeah, brain imaging. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1868.9599999999998s)]
*  You can see the changes up to 30 years [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1869.8s)]
*  before you got Alzheimer's as a symptom. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1871.36s)]
*  With blood tests, it's not as far as that. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1873.28s)]
*  We're still figuring out what those times are. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1876.0s)]
*  But you can see these proteins start to develop [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1878.4399999999998s)]
*  in the blood that indicate there's something happening. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1881.28s)]
*  And you can then intervene early. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1883.9599999999998s)]
*  And the thing about Alzheimer's is that [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1885.8799999999999s)]
*  if you intervene early, you can have an incredible benefit [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1887.76s)]
*  to help slow the progression and delay it [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1890.36s)]
*  and actually reverse it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1892.3999999999999s)]
*  And I've seen this in my patients. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1893.6399999999999s)]
*  I wrote a book about this, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1894.8s)]
*  the Ultramine Solution 15 years ago. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1895.9199999999998s)]
*  The Al Bredesen's written a book called [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1898.0s)]
*  The End of Alzheimer's, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1899.08s)]
*  and documenting that we have to get through causes. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1900.76s)]
*  Is NIH on this? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1903.08s)]
*  No, they're not on it. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1904.32s)]
*  And this is what drives me crazy. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1905.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1906.3999999999999s)]
*  So I'm saying we spent so much money, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1907.24s)]
*  we've gotten really no results. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1909.1999999999998s)]
*  Because I don't think you're a crackpot. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1910.56s)]
*  But if, I mean, here you are sitting on camera saying, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1912.08s)]
*  oh, Alzheimer's is reversible. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1914.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1916.4799999999998s)]
*  Talk about a headline. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1917.32s)]
*  Why isn't that in the New York Times? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1918.28s)]
*  No, I'm serious though. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1920.96s)]
*  Good freaking question. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1921.8s)]
*  So either you're crazy or they're dishonest. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1922.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1925.0s)]
*  I think it's a medical paradigm shift. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1925.84s)]
*  You know, I think as most doctors [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1929.36s)]
*  are in a world this flat world, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1931.48s)]
*  they don't understand that the world is round. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1933.48s)]
*  We've shifted a paradigm scientifically [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1935.52s)]
*  from a disease-based diagnostic system [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1937.92s)]
*  to understanding the body as an integrated ecosystem. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1941.44s)]
*  And so the work of people like Lee Ray Hood [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1944.2s)]
*  from the Institute for Systems Biology, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1946.32s)]
*  his Phenome Project, is mapping out [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1948.36s)]
*  how our understanding of disease is completely wrong. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1950.56s)]
*  It's based on labeling people according to symptoms [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1954.24s)]
*  and where it is in their body [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1958.08s)]
*  rather than on mechanisms and causes. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1959.2s)]
*  So I wrote a book called Young Forever, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  which is about longevity. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1963.1599999999999s)]
*  We talked about it, I think, last time I was on your show. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1964.04s)]
*  And in the book, I talk about the scientists [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1966.56s)]
*  who come up with this model [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1969.8s)]
*  of what are the root causes of aging? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1971.08s)]
*  Because we think aging is just, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1972.96s)]
*  it's gonna happen inevitably. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1974.52s)]
*  We're gonna get sick, we're gonna get older, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1975.48s)]
*  we're gonna get frail, we're gonna get weak. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1976.84s)]
*  And they've identified the underlying biology behind that. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1978.4399999999998s)]
*  So if we cured heart disease and cancer [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1981.72s)]
*  from the face of the planet, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1983.32s)]
*  we might extend life five to seven years. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1984.6799999999998s)]
*  You can get the same thing with meaning and purpose [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1986.84s)]
*  or playing tennis. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1988.32s)]
*  But if you actually drill with the hallmarks of aging, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1990.12s)]
*  the things that really go wrong, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1992.6399999999999s)]
*  inflammation, medical insolentia, or nutrition, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1993.56s)]
*  you can actually, and your microbiome, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1997.04s)]
*  all the things that underlie disease, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=1998.8799999999999s)]
*  you could extend life by 30 or 40 years, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2000.26s)]
*  which means living to 120, which is a crazy notion, right? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2001.9199999999998s)]
*  So we now understand biology in a very different way [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2005.44s)]
*  than we did before, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2008.92s)]
*  and it hasn't translated into the clinic. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2009.8400000000001s)]
*  And so why I co-founded Function Health with my co-founders [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2012.24s)]
*  was to help accelerate this gap, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2015.8s)]
*  to kind of leapfrog over this ossified system. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2017.48s)]
*  But we need to change- [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2020.3600000000001s)]
*  But it's just kind of crazy what you're saying. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2021.2s)]
*  If you take three steps back, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2022.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's like the whole point of medicine, I presumed, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2023.2s)]
*  was to extend and improve life. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2025.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2028.3200000000002s)]
*  Right, to keep you from dying. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2029.16s)]
*  Yeah, doctors- [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2030.28s)]
*  To make you healthier. Exactly. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2031.1200000000001s)]
*  To make you happier. Yeah. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2031.94s)]
*  And so if there is science that shows that that's possible, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2032.92s)]
*  and everyone's ignoring it, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2037.68s)]
*  then I'm trying not to use profanity, but what is that? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2038.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's a good question, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2041.8000000000002s)]
*  because we have a illness, medical, industrial, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2043.1200000000001s)]
*  food, ag complex that profits off of people being sick. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2046.72s)]
*  So you write a book saying, or someone else, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2049.84s)]
*  several doctors write books saying, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2052.2200000000003s)]
*  I can show that Alzheimer's is reversible. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2054.08s)]
*  And what does every other doctor in America say? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2057.32s)]
*  They just don't read the book, they haven't heard of it? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2060.36s)]
*  Like what- Yeah, it's like- [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2061.76s)]
*  That's kind of a provocative thesis. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2063.4s)]
*  Because I think of Alzheimer's as like AIDS in 1986, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2065.1200000000003s)]
*  like it's the worst thing. Oh, it's big. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2067.48s)]
*  And there's nothing you can do about it. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2068.7200000000003s)]
*  No, it's- [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2070.0s)]
*  Do you remember that with AIDS? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2070.84s)]
*  100%, it's scary as hell. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2071.6600000000003s)]
*  And- The scariest, yeah. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2073.0400000000004s)]
*  And I can tell you that this is not my opinion. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2074.36s)]
*  I was at a Cleveland Clinic, I worked with Marvin Saba [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2078.4s)]
*  when he was there, he was the head [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2081.0s)]
*  of the Dementia Research Center. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2081.84s)]
*  He understood this, he understood these mechanisms, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2083.1600000000003s)]
*  these biology, the science is there, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2085.0800000000004s)]
*  but there's no funding for it, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2087.2000000000003s)]
*  because what are we talking about, Tucker? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2088.32s)]
*  We're talking about providing lifestyle interventions, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2089.72s)]
*  they're intensive, the people need support, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2092.72s)]
*  they need to change their diet, they need to exercise, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2094.3199999999997s)]
*  they need to optimize their sleep, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2096.5s)]
*  they need to manage stress, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2097.7599999999998s)]
*  they need to take the right nutritional supplements, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2099.04s)]
*  they need to modify their risk factors aggressively. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2100.66s)]
*  This requires a very different reimbursement system. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2103.48s)]
*  We don't have evidence-based medicine, Tucker. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2105.9599999999996s)]
*  We have reimbursement-based medicine. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2108.8599999999997s)]
*  Doctors do what they get paid to do, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2110.7999999999997s)]
*  not what the right thing is. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2112.9199999999996s)]
*  The right treatment for diabetes is not, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2114.2599999999998s)]
*  or drugs or a Zempik, the right treatment is diet. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2116.16s)]
*  So it sounds like doctors aren't really in control. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2120.52s)]
*  I mean, they're doing the best they can. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2123.08s)]
*  They're responding to forces bigger than themselves. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2125.3599999999997s)]
*  Medical education's a great example. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2129.14s)]
*  Like, doctors graduating in the 50s or 40s [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2130.64s)]
*  were dealing with infectious disease and acute care medicine, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2134.6s)]
*  and we have the best acute care medicine system [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2136.7599999999998s)]
*  in the world, bar none. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2138.7s)]
*  If you have an acute infection, if you have sepsis, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2140.48s)]
*  if you need an ICU. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2142.72s)]
*  You're in a car crash. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2143.56s)]
*  You're in a car crash, damn right, I'm going to the hospital. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2144.3799999999997s)]
*  But that system doesn't work for chronic illness, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2146.68s)]
*  and that's what we're facing now. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2150.12s)]
*  And so the 80% of the conditions that doctors are seeing [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2151.3599999999997s)]
*  are chronic diseases for which drugs [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2154.48s)]
*  are not the right therapy most of the time. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2157.0s)]
*  They can be helpful as adjuncts, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2159.48s)]
*  but the fundamental drivers of our chronic disease epidemic [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2161.48s)]
*  is the food we're eating, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2164.2s)]
*  and also environmental toxins that are adding to that. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2165.56s)]
*  And when you add those two things together, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2168.3999999999996s)]
*  it explains most of the chronic disease epidemic. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2169.68s)]
*  It's just, I mean, a lot of smart people you included, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2171.52s)]
*  you're definitely one of the earliest, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2175.24s)]
*  but are saying varieties of what you're saying now. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2176.72s)]
*  So I mean, it was 30 years ago or so [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2179.4399999999996s)]
*  that the Congress hauled the heads of the tobacco companies, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2181.8399999999997s)]
*  Reynolds and Philip Morris and Laura Lardon, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2184.7599999999998s)]
*  humiliated them on camera, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2187.8399999999997s)]
*  and you knew you were hurting people, you did it anyway. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2189.12s)]
*  Is that going to happen with Nabisco anytime soon? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2192.16s)]
*  I mean, there are class action lawsuits [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2194.3599999999997s)]
*  that are being now raised around these companies [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2196.8799999999997s)]
*  to look at holding them accountable for what they're doing, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2200.9599999999996s)]
*  and they know, and there's been FOIA requests [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2203.0s)]
*  and information requests that I actually wrote about [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2205.32s)]
*  in my book that show their nefarious behavior, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2207.44s)]
*  for example, targeting minorities [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2209.6s)]
*  and targeting poor income, lower income people [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2211.84s)]
*  to focus on buying more junk food. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2214.44s)]
*  Well, the food stamp program is a perfect example of that. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2217.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of crazy to talk about [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2220.0s)]
*  when you think about it. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2221.4s)]
*  When the American taxpayer is paying through the nose [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2222.24s)]
*  for everything all the way along, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2224.36s)]
*  the companies are privatizing profits [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2226.52s)]
*  and we're socializing the costs. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2228.48s)]
*  So we basically fund the growth of commodity crops [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2230.52s)]
*  with $20 billion of subsidies in crop insurance [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2233.08s)]
*  for corn, wheat, and soy to the farmers, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2235.72s)]
*  which puts them in a really tight bond [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2237.7599999999998s)]
*  because they can't change their system without support [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2239.72s)]
*  to changing to a more regenerative system [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2241.72s)]
*  that they're going to make more money, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2244.08s)]
*  they're going to grow better food, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2245.16s)]
*  they're going to have better resuscitation [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2246.08s)]
*  of their real economies, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2249.32s)]
*  and not hopefully commit suicide at the rate they're doing. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2250.72s)]
*  We pay for that, and then we pay for those foods [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2253.36s)]
*  for our SNAP program. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2256.32s)]
*  So we have about 125 billion in SNAP, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2257.88s)]

*  it's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2262.28s)]
*  but there's no N in there, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2264.04s)]
*  it's just food security, which means calories. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  So when you get your EBT benefits [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2267.52s)]
*  in the beginning of the month, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2270.6000000000004s)]
*  these food companies know to advertise in the bodega. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2272.0s)]
*  So they'll get your two liter bottle of Coke with your EBT [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2274.32s)]
*  and they put these giant ads in there [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2276.6400000000003s)]
*  and they know exactly when they're getting their carts. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2278.44s)]
*  So we basically fund- [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2280.04s)]
*  So you can buy Coca-Cola with- [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2281.6800000000003s)]
*  75% of the food bought on SNAP is junk food, 10% is soda. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2283.36s)]
*  So you think about $12 billion on soda, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2288.52s)]
*  the Americans paying- [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2290.32s)]
*  Why would soda be fed? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2291.44s)]
*  Why would, if we're giving out nutritional assistance [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2293.48s)]
*  to the poor, why would we pay for soda? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2296.44s)]
*  What an obvious question, Tucker. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2298.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's- [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2300.32s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2302.1200000000003s)]
*  It's crazy, it's crazy. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2302.96s)]
*  And we know- [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2304.04s)]
*  If you wanted to hurt the poor, you would do that. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2304.88s)]
*  I mean, we know beyond a doubt, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2306.08s)]
*  and we can talk about ultra processed food, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2308.0s)]
*  there's arguments this and that way and this way, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2309.84s)]
*  but the food industry will say, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2311.56s)]
*  oh, we're going to take away people's choice, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2312.7200000000003s)]
*  we're going to take away convenience, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2315.0s)]

*  we're going to make food less safe, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2317.4s)]

*  These are their talking points. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2320.0s)]
*  It's not all, it's all about calories, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2321.32s)]
*  it's not moderation, so you can have, you know, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2323.0s)]
*  soda as part of your diet, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2325.1600000000003s)]
*  as long as you don't exceed your calories. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2326.2400000000002s)]
*  It's basically your fault that you're fat, so you fix it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2327.6s)]
*  That's the messaging, right? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2330.44s)]
*  It's the messaging from every food industry, sort of- [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2331.88s)]
*  Get it. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2334.48s)]
*  Message from every professional association, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2335.32s)]
*  message from the medicals, sort of- [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2336.8s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that we have to pay for it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2339.12s)]
*  Why are we paying for it? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2340.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, that's it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2341.52s)]
*  So we pay for probably 30 billion or more servings [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2342.36s)]
*  of soda for the poor every year. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2345.8s)]
*  And then we pay for- [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2347.48s)]
*  Taxpayers are sending all this money to Coca-Cola. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2348.84s)]
*  The biggest profit center in America for Coca-Cola [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2351.2400000000002s)]

*  Walmart gets, I don't know, something like, you know, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2359.2400000000002s)]
*  40 billion of that food stamp bill. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2362.28s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2364.2400000000002s)]
*  And we pay on the other- [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2365.6800000000003s)]
*  Are those numbers real? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2368.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I can get you the Walmart numbers, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2369.2000000000003s)]
*  but yeah, it's really high. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2371.1200000000003s)]
*  And then we have- [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2373.52s)]
*  That's shocking. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2375.84s)]
*  To pay for Medicare and Medicaid on the back end [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2376.68s)]
*  when people get sick from those foods. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2379.52s)]
*  And then we pay all the other costs- [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2381.2s)]
*  So you pay for the Coca-Cola and the Azemba. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2382.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, the price we pay to check out- [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2384.2400000000002s)]
*  The Pop Tarts and the insulin. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2385.88s)]
*  I mean, that's right. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2387.08s)]
*  The price you pay to check out K-Counter [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2387.92s)]
*  is not the true cost of food. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2391.44s)]
*  The true cost of food, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2393.6s)]
*  the Rockefeller Foundation report, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2394.64s)]

*  there's three dollars in collateral damage. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2397.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2398.88s)]
*  To health- [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2399.72s)]
*  Pay for the crack and the rehab. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2400.54s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2401.76s)]
*  It's totally nuts. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2403.28s)]
*  Pay for the hookers and the divorce. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2404.12s)]
*  And we can fix this. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2404.96s)]
*  It's so nuts. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2405.8s)]
*  We can fix this. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2406.6400000000003s)]
*  And Andy Harris, who's a congressman, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2407.84s)]
*  wanted to do a simple pilot study, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2412.0s)]
*  just a pilot study to see what would happen [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2413.96s)]
*  if we eliminated soda from food stamp benefits [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2416.08s)]
*  in a couple of locations, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2419.0s)]
*  just to monitor the impact on the health of those people. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2420.2400000000002s)]
*  And he couldn't get it through as a pilot, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2424.32s)]
*  not to change the entire USC policy, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2427.44s)]
*  just as a pilot study. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2429.0s)]
*  So imagine how anti-science this is. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2430.36s)]
*  This is truly anti-science. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2433.56s)]
*  So it's just, I really believe in naming and shaming. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2434.3999999999996s)]
*  It works. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2437.04s)]
*  Just call people out. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2438.0s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2441.24s)]

*  And by the way, I'm not saying [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2443.56s)]
*  you shouldn't be allowed to buy Coca-Cola. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2444.8399999999997s)]

*  Right. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2447.52s)]
*  That's fair, isn't it? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2448.3599999999997s)]
*  100%. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2449.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, the government of the United States [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2450.2s)]
*  should not be funding the chronic disease epidemic, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2452.08s)]
*  which they currently are. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2455.68s)]
*  They are either by policies that were put in, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2457.12s)]
*  that were innocent or by... [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2462.52s)]
*  But it's so perfect. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2464.16s)]
*  It's like when I learned that we were funding ISIS in Syria, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2465.2s)]
*  I was like, that's kind of perfect actually. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2469.3599999999997s)]
*  Both sides are taking American money. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2471.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2473.68s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2474.52s)]
*  But we have the opportunity to change that. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2475.7999999999997s)]
*  For example, WIC, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2477.2s)]
*  which is Women, Infants and Children's Food Program, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2478.3599999999997s)]
*  is based on only allowing people to buy food [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2480.88s)]
*  that's going to be healthy for the mother and child. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2483.3599999999997s)]
*  Why not apply that to WIC? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2485.8399999999997s)]
*  Why not school standards being changed [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2487.96s)]
*  so that actually kids can have healthy food? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2489.88s)]
*  I think WIC is like the center of profit [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2492.84s)]
*  for the formula makers, isn't it? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2495.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's true. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2496.92s)]
*  That's another problem. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2498.1600000000003s)]
*  But yeah, for example, in Chile, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2499.08s)]
*  they outlawed formula marketing for kids. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2500.2400000000002s)]
*  They outlawed advertising to kids. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2502.12s)]
*  They got rid of all the junk food in schools. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2503.96s)]
*  They put it front and back, really blank. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2505.44s)]
*  Why would the federal taxpayers, me included, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2506.6400000000003s)]
*  you included, be paying for baby formula? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2509.36s)]
*  Why would we be encouraging formula over breast milk? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2511.76s)]
*  Well, it's a huge industry. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2513.8s)]
*  I mean, it's all... [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2515.7200000000003s)]
*  It's really, it's... [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2516.64s)]
*  You know, there's a group from the WHO [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2518.8399999999997s)]
*  has put together some initial papers [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2521.2s)]
*  and is coming out with a report next year [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2523.2799999999997s)]
*  about the commercial determinants of health, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2524.44s)]
*  which is how multinational and transnational corporations [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2526.64s)]
*  in food and ag and alcohol, tobacco, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2529.6s)]
*  are essentially driving our chronic disease epidemic [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2532.72s)]
*  and they're privatizing the profits, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2534.8799999999997s)]
*  subverting public health and socializing the costs. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2536.64s)]
*  And the governments are the ones [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2538.72s)]
*  who are struggling with this. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2539.64s)]
*  And so there are many other countries. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2540.72s)]
*  But the governments are paying for it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2542.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, governments are paying for it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2543.4s)]
*  And you look at the healthiest countries, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2544.48s)]
*  they're the ones like Japan and Singapore and Spain and Italy. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2547.2400000000002s)]
*  They actually have policies that are protecting [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2549.0s)]
*  their citizens, that are educating them about food, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2551.28s)]
*  that are not allowing the same... [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2552.96s)]
*  Well, how about just don't pay for it? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2553.8s)]
*  I mean, let's, we can start there. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2554.76s)]
*  So Christmas is coming and winter is coming. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2556.28s)]
*  And that's the perfect combination for Cozy Earth. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2559.7200000000003s)]
*  Cozy Earth is a company that makes [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2564.36s)]
*  exactly what it sounds like, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2566.48s)]
*  products that are close to the earth [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2568.84s)]
*  and that are quite cozy. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2571.2400000000002s)]
*  And you should consider them this Christmas. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2573.48s)]
*  They have the best sheets available. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2575.64s)]
*  They're made out of bamboo, believe it or not. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2577.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's hard to believe how great they are [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2580.56s)]
*  until you try them, we have, and they are great. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2582.4s)]

*  What sets them apart? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2586.96s)]
*  Well, their fabrics are temperature regulating. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2588.52s)]
*  That means they keep you cool and cozy [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2591.2799999999997s)]

*  tell them the Tucker Carlson Show sent you. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2610.48s)]
*  Everyone here uses those sheets and loves them. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2612.7599999999998s)]
*  And it does raise some pretty interesting questions. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2615.96s)]
*  The smartest thing I've heard this year, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2620.16s)]
*  I think it's a common phrase now, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2621.44s)]
*  is that the point of the system is its outcome. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2622.7599999999998s)]
*  So if you're wondering about motive, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2625.36s)]
*  look at what the system produces [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2626.7999999999997s)]
*  and that describes the motive. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2628.48s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2630.0s)]
*  We don't have to guess. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2631.08s)]
*  Like, so if governments are making their citizens [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2632.12s)]
*  more unhealthy, I think we can assume [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2637.6s)]
*  that they want that outcome. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2640.8399999999997s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2641.88s)]
*  They don't. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2642.72s)]
*  This has been the frog in boiling water slowly [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2643.56s)]
*  that's hit them so fast. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2646.16s)]
*  Cause yeah, bring all these fast food companies, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2647.2799999999997s)]
*  bring all these American companies in [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2650.16s)]
*  to help us with our food and nutrition. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2652.08s)]
*  Let's get fast food everywhere. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2653.7999999999997s)]
*  It's kind of the Americanization of the world, right? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2654.92s)]
*  We basically created the worst out in the planet [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2657.8399999999997s)]
*  and exported to every country in the world. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2659.7999999999997s)]
*  And we see now, even in the developing world, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2662.8s)]
*  they call it the double burden of disease, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2664.8s)]
*  chronic disease and infectious disease. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2668.8s)]
*  So they're dying of diabetes and tuberculosis. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2670.4s)]
*  So dying of diabetes and malaria. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2672.6s)]
*  I hate to say it, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2674.64s)]
*  but I've traveled a lot of countries this year [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2675.48s)]
*  and the best food I had in any country [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2677.0s)]
*  was in a country under such severe US sanctions [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2678.84s)]
*  that no US companies could operate. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2681.52s)]
*  I'm not gonna name the country, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2683.76s)]
*  but I'm just saying, I don't wanna be too controversial. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2684.68s)]
*  And it makes me sad. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2687.52s)]
*  You controversial, Tucker? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2688.36s)]
*  Well, it makes me, I mean, I'm- [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2689.32s)]
*  You always color in the line. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2690.96s)]
*  I think of myself as a truly a loyal American. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2692.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm all in on America. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2695.4s)]
*  I'm never leaving. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2696.28s)]
*  But to go to a country whose food is the best [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2697.28s)]
*  I've ever had in my whole life. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2699.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2701.0s)]
*  And it also happens that that country [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2702.0s)]
*  has no American food of any kind [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2703.92s)]
*  because it's not allowed. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2705.28s)]
*  Maybe there's a connection? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2707.0s)]
*  Maybe there's a connection, yeah. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2708.1200000000003s)]
*  So exactly. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2709.44s)]
*  And so these countries have been unwittingly [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2710.28s)]
*  participating in what they thought [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2714.2400000000002s)]
*  was growth and economic development, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2715.88s)]
*  but what it's done is sicken their populations. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2717.76s)]
*  And so now a lot of these countries are standing up. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2720.2s)]
*  Like the UK just banned advertising of junk food. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2723.2s)]
*  France has clear labeling on their front of package [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2726.24s)]
*  to make it really clear what you're eating. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2728.52s)]
*  Chile and South America, you go there [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2730.52s)]
*  and there's big just warning signs on the front of labels. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2732.2s)]
*  They've done all these policies [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2734.52s)]
*  that have actually been studied and worked. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2735.64s)]
*  So we have cover in the United States. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2737.04s)]
*  Why should we be allowing things in the United States [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2739.16s)]
*  that we don't, these other countries have determined [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2741.52s)]
*  are insane? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2743.2s)]
*  Well, at least paying for it. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2744.04s)]
*  Let's just stop paying for it. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2744.8799999999997s)]
*  People are into some weird self-destructive behavior, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2746.52s)]
*  not interested in rooting it out [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2749.44s)]
*  or showing up at your house, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2750.6800000000003s)]
*  making sure you're not doing it. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2751.56s)]
*  Absolutely, no, no, no. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2752.4s)]
*  People should be informed. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2753.2400000000002s)]
*  But I definitely don't wanna pay for it. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2754.08s)]
*  Why should I have to pay? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2755.2400000000002s)]
*  It's so insulting. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2756.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, people should be informed [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2757.08s)]
*  and we should be not having to pay for it. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2757.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2758.76s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, government procurement, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2759.58s)]
*  $166 billion the government spends on food [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2760.6800000000003s)]
*  for military, for correctional facility, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2763.6s)]
*  for schools, for everything. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2765.4s)]
*  When you look at the fat belt, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2767.4s)]
*  do you know how much that could change the food system [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2768.52s)]
*  if we said based on these set of nutritional principles, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2770.52s)]
*  which are I think well accepted [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2774.48s)]
*  in the nutritional science community [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2776.96s)]
*  of being what is food? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2778.24s)]
*  If we just followed that [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2780.08s)]
*  and didn't pay for all the junk food [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2781.52s)]
*  and ultra processed food, we just took that out, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2783.4s)]
*  it would change the food system in America. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2786.12s)]
*  Well, yeah, because. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2787.52s)]
*  Because all the industry would change. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2788.3599999999997s)]
*  If you take $166 billion out of the food economy [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2789.18s)]
*  and say we're only buying healthy food [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2791.88s)]
*  from farmers that produce healthy food, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2793.52s)]
*  it's gonna change everything from field to fork. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2795.16s)]
*  These are simple things that the government can do [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2797.18s)]
*  that's easy. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2799.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because they control it. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2801.2799999999997s)]
*  So people, I know, I've known a lot of people [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2802.2799999999997s)]
*  who go to prison more now than ever, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2803.96s)]
*  and they get fat in prison, a lot of them. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2806.3599999999997s)]
*  I assume that's because of the food. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2809.04s)]
*  Of course, I mean in prisons, they did another study, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2810.2799999999997s)]
*  I mentioned about the juvenile detention centers. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2812.44s)]
*  They swapped out prisoners' food for healthy food, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2814.16s)]
*  and they found there was a 56% reduction [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2817.16s)]
*  in violent crime in the prisons [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2819.16s)]
*  and an 80% reduction if they added a multivitamin. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2820.36s)]
*  So there's so much nutritional deficiencies. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2822.68s)]
*  In countries like Japan, they put people [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2825.0s)]
*  on a super healthy diet in prison [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2827.1s)]
*  and all their violent behavior goes down. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2828.48s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2830.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2831.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2832.32s)]
*  Yeah, their diet's totally different. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2833.14s)]
*  They're like a macro-biotic, very kind of healthy diet [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2833.98s)]
*  that gets them completely reset. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2838.5600000000004s)]
*  And we know the mental health crisis also. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2839.4s)]
*  Why don't we do that since it's a captive population? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2841.96s)]
*  We should, we can. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2844.8s)]
*  I mean, the problem is, this is a very, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2845.8s)]
*  I don't wanna sound conspiratorial, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2849.92s)]
*  but I'm telling you there is a very loose organization [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2851.48s)]
*  of industries that are working together [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2855.36s)]
*  to keep the system status quo. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2858.84s)]
*  They don't want changes in our agricultural subsidies. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2860.6000000000004s)]
*  They don't want changes in farming practices. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2862.6400000000003s)]
*  They don't want changes in how we fund SNAP. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2864.5600000000004s)]
*  They don't want changes in how we reimburse healthcare. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2866.28s)]
*  They don't want changes in our food labeling. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2869.0s)]
*  They don't want changes in ingredients that are in our food. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2870.88s)]
*  This is stuff that's so entrenched [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2874.1200000000003s)]
*  that it's essential for their profits and their success. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2876.0s)]
*  But we are so- [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2879.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, prisons, if you think about it, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2880.0800000000004s)]
*  have been used as, because it is captive, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2880.92s)]
*  the population of a prison, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2883.38s)]
*  they've been used as testing populations [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2885.1200000000003s)]
*  for syphilis and vaccines and LSD [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2887.96s)]
*  and all kinds of horrible shit. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2891.44s)]
*  And you feel so sorry for the men who had to endure that. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2893.44s)]
*  Why not use prisons? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2897.04s)]
*  I'm not sure the LSD was bad for them, but. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2897.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, Whitey Bulger was at Alcatraz, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2898.72s)]
*  Whitey Bulger, the head of the Winter Hill Gang in Boston, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2903.12s)]
*  a mass murderer. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2905.92s)]
*  And he got dosed really hard with LSD at Alcatraz [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2907.2s)]
*  in the early 60s and wound up effectively a serial killer. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2912.08s)]
*  And his brother didn't and wound up [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2915.56s)]
*  the most powerful politician in Massachusetts. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2917.52s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2919.56s)]
*  So I'm just saying, you know. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2920.3999999999996s)]
*  Maybe flip them. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2921.72s)]
*  But anyway, here's the point. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2922.56s)]
*  Why not use prisons as a kind of federal prisons, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2924.64s)]
*  as a national test for the outcome of the diet [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2929.12s)]
*  you're suggesting? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2932.68s)]
*  Yeah, you could do that. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2933.52s)]
*  I mean, there were studies that were done [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2934.3399999999997s)]
*  in mental institutions years ago, but there's ethics. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2936.24s)]
*  And so informed consent. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2938.2799999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2939.92s)]
*  Not feeding people Oreos is unethical? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2940.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2942.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2943.72s)]
*  Well, I think you're right, Tucker. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2944.56s)]
*  I mean, the ethical considerations [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2946.7599999999998s)]
*  are really around informed consent medicine. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2948.56s)]
*  We gave them syphilis! [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2950.24s)]
*  You can't agree. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2951.56s)]
*  Okay, it's okay to take the Oreos away. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2952.4s)]
*  Now there's rules about this. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2953.96s)]
*  No, I'm just saying like. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2954.8s)]
*  But we could, we could. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2956.4s)]
*  We could get informed consent. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2957.36s)]
*  We could ask them. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2958.52s)]
*  You pay them 15 cents an hour to work? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2959.36s)]
*  I mean, they're prisoners. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2960.84s)]
*  They can't vote, they can't own firearms. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2961.68s)]
*  They can't see their wives. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2963.12s)]
*  Like everything about it is horrible. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2965.4s)]
*  Why wouldn't you use the opportunity [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2967.48s)]
*  to improve their health? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2969.0s)]
*  I 100% agree. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2969.92s)]
*  I think we need to do that. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2970.92s)]
*  Every sector of society where the government has a hand. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2972.44s)]
*  School lunches, the military, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2975.98s)]
*  all our federal food programs. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2978.52s)]
*  These are easy interventions, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2980.04s)]
*  but the food industry blocks it [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2981.96s)]
*  by huge lobbying efforts in Washington. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2983.32s)]
*  You know, in my non-profit Food Fixed Campaign, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2985.8s)]
*  which is really about educating and advocating [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2988.0s)]
*  for policy change to really improve the health of Americans. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2990.32s)]
*  We've been with over 150 centers and congressmen, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2992.88s)]
*  both sides of the aisle, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2994.8s)]
*  and everybody seems to get this issue [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2996.28s)]
*  and they're not hearing about it. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2997.88s)]
*  And they're starting to hear about it [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=2999.12s)]
*  because people like me are talking about it. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3000.32s)]
*  But I'm just one guy of a little non-profit. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3001.56s)]
*  I'm not funded by industry. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3003.6s)]
*  I don't have any like conflicts of interest. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3005.04s)]
*  And I'm just trying to, you know. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3006.52s)]
*  What are the big lobbies? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3007.68s)]
*  Everyone says the big food lobby. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3008.64s)]
*  What companies is that? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3010.32s)]
*  I mean, you've got the American Beverage Association. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3011.3199999999997s)]
*  You've got all the pharmaceutical lobby groups. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3013.2799999999997s)]
*  You've got all the ag lobby groups. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3016.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, collectively, they're the biggest group [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3018.68s)]
*  of lobbyists in Washington, exceeding all the other lobby. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3020.52s)]
*  And they're very powerful. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3024.2s)]
*  And they control a lot of what happens in Washington. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3025.46s)]
*  I detailed a lot of this in my book Food Fixed, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3027.7599999999998s)]
*  where Congressmen are funded by Coca-Cola [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3030.12s)]
*  or these big companies. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3033.48s)]
*  And they fund both sides. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3034.3199999999997s)]
*  They fund everybody. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3035.16s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3036.0s)]
*  And so they've got a lot of it locked up. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3036.8399999999997s)]
*  And they're miseducating. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3038.3999999999996s)]
*  It's the misinformation and miseducation [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3040.68s)]
*  of our policymakers and government officials [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3043.24s)]
*  because they're only hearing one side of the story. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3047.96s)]
*  They come in with their briefing books, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3050.9199999999996s)]
*  with their scientific papers, with their justification, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3052.1s)]
*  with their regulations written, with the legislation written. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3054.2799999999997s)]
*  And they literally give it to them. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3056.2s)]
*  I've been in Congressmen's centers office. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3057.7599999999998s)]
*  This is amazing, Mark. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3059.24s)]
*  Could you write the legislation for me? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3060.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3061.72s)]
*  I don't know how to do that. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3063.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, if I have people on my team, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3065.3599999999997s)]
*  we probably do that. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3066.6s)]
*  But it's like, it was sort of a startling [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3067.6s)]
*  kind of revelation that the people in Congress need help [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3070.84s)]
*  and they need guidance, they need direction. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3073.6000000000004s)]
*  And they're overwhelmed. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3075.0800000000004s)]
*  And they're overwhelmed and they're good people [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3075.92s)]
*  and they want to do the right thing. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3077.4s)]
*  And they're not hearing the other side of the story. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3078.28s)]
*  And so when you lay it out for them, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3081.0s)]
*  they're like, that was with Senator Boosman from Arkansas. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3082.1200000000003s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3084.92s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I'm seeing the changes [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3085.84s)]
*  in my rural community. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3087.6400000000003s)]
*  I've seen what's happening on the farms. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3088.48s)]
*  I'm seeing the degradation of these. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3089.52s)]
*  And I'm seeing the process for you. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3092.0800000000004s)]
*  I've seen what affects my population. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3093.1600000000003s)]
*  And he gets it. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3095.52s)]
*  And he wouldn't let me out of his office for 45 minutes. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3096.6800000000003s)]
*  You usually get like a Senator pops in high, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3098.48s)]
*  five minutes to run out. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3100.44s)]
*  But it was incredible conversation. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3101.36s)]
*  I've seen this with Randy Fenstri, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3103.28s)]
*  who's really interested in regenerative agriculture. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3104.48s)]
*  I've seen this on the Democratic side [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3105.92s)]
*  with people like Cory Booker and Richard Neal [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3107.8s)]
*  and James McGovern, who are trying to advocate [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3111.04s)]
*  for food policies. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3113.48s)]
*  So Roger Marshall and Cassidy, both doctors, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3114.6s)]
*  fully in on this stuff. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3119.08s)]
*  So there's so many allies in Congress on both sides [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3120.0s)]
*  of the aisle that are sort of sick and tired [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3122.2400000000002s)]
*  of how this thing is going and realize we can't continue [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3123.84s)]
*  to do what we're doing. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3126.4s)]
*  And I think, Tucker, we have a historic opportunity [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3127.52s)]
*  with Trump and Bobby Kennedy. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3129.68s)]
*  Dr. Oz now is the head of CMS and other people. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3132.4s)]
*  I think hopefully Casey Means will be [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3134.8s)]
*  a Surgeon General, Senator General. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3136.68s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3137.52s)]
*  I think we can have a shift in the thinking [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3138.36s)]
*  and educate America, just like we did with smoking, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3141.52s)]
*  and we can win. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3144.36s)]
*  It's just so funny that, I mean, whatever, life is irony. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3145.2s)]
*  Everything is irony. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3148.0s)]
*  But the Big Mac president is ushering in, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3149.16s)]
*  it's just crazy. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3153.64s)]
*  Oh no, I'm saying of all people. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3154.48s)]
*  But it makes sense, right? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3155.96s)]
*  Johnson was one of the biggest bigots. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3157.7599999999998s)]
*  He signed the Civil Rights Act. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3159.2s)]
*  Reagan was the most staunch anti-communist. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3160.7999999999997s)]
*  He's the one who ended the Cold War. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3162.7999999999997s)]
*  So there's a historical back. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3164.2s)]
*  No, that's very deep. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3165.56s)]
*  What you're saying is deep. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3166.4s)]
*  No, that is the way life is, actually. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3167.24s)]
*  It's the opposite of what you expect. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3168.7999999999997s)]
*  And I've talked to Trump about it and he means it. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3170.8399999999997s)]
*  I would say Bobby Kennedy is one of the nominees [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3174.8399999999997s)]
*  he's proudest of. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3177.7999999999997s)]
*  He hasn't backed down at all. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3178.7999999999997s)]
*  I think Bobby's gonna get confirmed. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3180.6s)]
*  I wanna ask you about the thing for which [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3182.24s)]
*  Bobby is most famous. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3185.0s)]
*  I don't wanna say the word because YouTube [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3187.6800000000003s)]
*  will monetize this. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3189.04s)]
*  You're not even allowed, even now. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3189.88s)]
*  YouTube, biggest company, most powerful company [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3192.1600000000003s)]
*  in the world, Google, has an AI program [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3193.76s)]
*  that will literally knock out your video [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3196.92s)]
*  if you use the V word. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3198.96s)]
*  So let's call it the shot. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3200.6800000000003s)]
*  The V word. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3201.92s)]
*  If you don't mind. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3202.76s)]
*  The V word. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3203.6000000000004s)]
*  Not the good V word, the bad V word. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3204.56s)]
*  So Bobby Kennedy became infamous 15 or 20 years ago [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3208.32s)]
*  when he wrote a piece in Rolling Stone [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3213.28s)]
*  suggesting that, I mean he just got exiled [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3216.04s)]
*  from America, basically, for suggesting that [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3218.08s)]
*  the shot might cause really bad outcomes, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3220.52s)]
*  health outcomes in children. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3224.3599999999997s)]
*  I never hear anybody bring that up anymore. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3227.48s)]
*  Have you accepted that there may be truth in that? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3230.44s)]
*  Well, listen, I think we get religion around [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3232.24s)]
*  certain topics in medicine. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3236.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3237.04s)]
*  And I don't understand this. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3237.8799999999997s)]
*  Medicine is supposed to be about science. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3239.48s)]
*  Yes, that's what I thought. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3241.48s)]
*  It's about asking questions. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3243.12s)]
*  And to say a subject is settled [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3245.2799999999997s)]
*  and we need no more science doesn't make any sense. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3247.4399999999996s)]
*  Like aspirin's a great example. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3250.52s)]
*  We thought aspirin was the greatest thing [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3251.68s)]
*  on the planet Earth, that everybody should get an aspirin [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3253.2799999999997s)]
*  to prevent a heart attack. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3255.68s)]
*  But as we start to look at the data very carefully, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3257.24s)]
*  we saw that, gee, no, actually it increases [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3260.0s)]
*  the risk of certain problems like brain hemorrhage [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3262.24s)]
*  and gastrointestinal bleeding and death. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3264.7999999999997s)]
*  And 30,000 people die every year from taking aspirin [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3266.72s)]
*  for prevention of heart attacks. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3269.16s)]
*  What? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3270.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3271.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't even know that. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3272.1s)]
*  Right, so I thought you're supposed to take [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3272.9399999999996s)]
*  baby aspirin every day. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3274.24s)]
*  Well, that's right, but it causes bleeding. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3275.24s)]
*  It thins your blood. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3278.2799999999997s)]
*  That's why it's good for preventing heart attacks, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3279.12s)]
*  but also it can make you have a brain hemorrhage [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3280.52s)]
*  or a gut blade. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3282.52s)]
*  And so now the guidelines have been revised [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3284.3599999999997s)]
*  and it's not recommended for everybody, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3286.68s)]
*  only certain high-risk populations. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3288.16s)]
*  And yet we change our mind based on the data. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3290.92s)]
*  We look at the science. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3293.8799999999997s)]
*  We update our data. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3295.04s)]
*  The V word is, listen, I'm just gonna say it. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3297.24s)]
*  I think vaccines are one of the greatest advances [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3300.2s)]
*  in medicine in history. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3303.04s)]
*  They have eradicated many serious diseases, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3304.24s)]
*  polio, smallpox. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3307.16s)]
*  I mean, I was in Haiti during the earthquake [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3309.7599999999998s)]
*  and I was working at the internal hospital there [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3312.08s)]
*  and there was a guy with tetanus. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3314.44s)]
*  I'd never seen a full-blown case of tetanus before. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3315.64s)]
*  It was one of the worst things I'd ever seen. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3318.08s)]
*  What is it? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3319.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3320.2s)]
*  Tetanus is when you step on a rusty nail. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3321.04s)]
*  Right, lockjaw, they used to call it. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3322.24s)]
*  Yeah, lockjaw, but you basically go into total paralysis. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3323.44s)]
*  Like your body's in a, it's like one big giant spasm [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3326.92s)]
*  and you can't get out of it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3330.04s)]
*  And you basically have to give them IVs and oxygen [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3331.7599999999998s)]
*  and hope they survive. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3334.52s)]
*  And there's tetanus and antitoxin, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3335.4399999999996s)]
*  but it was the worst thing I'd ever seen. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3337.2799999999997s)]
*  So vaccines have a role. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3339.64s)]
*  And the problem is that- [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3341.8399999999997s)]
*  A tetanus shot is a vaccine? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3344.04s)]
*  Yeah, a tetanus shot is a vaccine. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3345.4399999999996s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3346.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, polio is a vaccine. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3347.6s)]
*  Of course, well, famously. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3348.56s)]
*  But a tetanus shot is a vaccine. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3350.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a vaccine. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3352.04s)]
*  You're supposed to get it every 10 years. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3352.9599999999996s)]
*  And diphtheria. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3354.72s)]
*  There's some really good things we've done in medicine [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3356.52s)]
*  to reduce a lot of the childhood illnesses [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3358.6s)]
*  like [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3361.36s)]
*  the death of a child. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3370.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3372.04s)]
*  Measles, this is, vaccines aren't a problem. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3372.88s)]
*  The problem is that we need to study long-term safety [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3375.4s)]
*  and efficacy of these drugs like any other drug. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3379.16s)]
*  One of the problems with medicine is that, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3382.16s)]
*  and I think this was a huge failure during COVID. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3384.48s)]
*  And I think Bobby was right about this. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3386.92s)]
*  Well, vaccines are safe, they're effective. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3389.16s)]
*  Well, not really. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3390.36s)]
*  Like any drug, it's sort of safe and it can be effective. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3392.08s)]
*  Aspirin is effective for certain things, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3395.12s)]
*  but it also has side effects. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3396.6s)]
*  And so vaccines work to prevent the mortality rates [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3398.56s)]
*  and reduce death rates and reduce the severity of infection. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3404.6s)]
*  But it didn't prevent infection. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3408.6s)]
*  And that was very clearly early on. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3410.64s)]
*  And there's this concept called sterile immunity [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3412.28s)]
*  versus disease immunity. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3415.52s)]
*  Sterile immunity is you get a measles shot [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3416.64s)]
*  when you're a kid, you never need it again. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3419.6800000000003s)]
*  You're sterile, you're never gonna get measles. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3420.52s)]
*  The flu vaccine, you have to get every year [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3422.96s)]
*  because you basically don't get permanent immunity. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3424.96s)]
*  You get sort of a reduction in the risk of disease. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3428.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what the COVID vaccine was. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3431.6400000000003s)]
*  So it reduced the risk, but it didn't prevent you getting it, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3433.6800000000003s)]
*  didn't prevent transmission. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3436.2400000000002s)]
*  And it also has side effects. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3437.6800000000003s)]
*  And we were pushing on young kids [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3440.1200000000003s)]
*  and now the data is really clear. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3441.4s)]
*  It caused increased myocarditis, heart inflammation. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3442.8s)]
*  So what we need is just good science. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3445.52s)]
*  And I think this is all Bobby's asking for. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3447.48s)]
*  He's not anti-vaccine. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3448.92s)]
*  He's been vaccinated. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3450.0s)]
*  I've been vaccinated. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3451.2400000000002s)]
*  We vaccinate our kids. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3452.08s)]
*  I think it's propaganda that say he's an anti-vaxxer. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3453.36s)]
*  That's really just a way of dismissing him. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3455.68s)]
*  But I think we have to understand [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3457.8s)]
*  that we just need to do good science. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3459.04s)]
*  And that's all he's asking for. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3460.28s)]
*  He recently come out and said he's not taking many vaccines. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3461.2400000000002s)]
*  He's pro-vaccines. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3463.96s)]
*  He wants good science. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3465.08s)]
*  And I think that's what we need around everything. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3466.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's whether it's Alzheimer's or there's diabetes [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3468.8s)]
*  or whether it's whatever it is, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3471.16s)]
*  we're studying the wrong things. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3472.32s)]
*  Now we've told you before about a staff favorite here at TCN, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3474.04s)]
*  the 8 Sleep Pod. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3478.2s)]
*  What is it? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3481.08s)]
*  It's a high-tech mattress that we talk about over lunch here, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3481.92s)]
*  our mattresses, because this one is excellent. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3484.44s)]
*  It's high-tech. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3486.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a cover. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3487.7599999999998s)]
*  It goes right over your existing bed. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3488.58s)]
*  Well, this Christmas, you can get it [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3490.48s)]
*  for the best price of the year, up to 600 bucks off. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3492.4s)]
*  The 8 Sleep Pod works by adjusting the temperature, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3496.2s)]
*  warmer or cooler, depending on your preference. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3498.52s)]
*  And it maintains an ideal sleeping network [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3501.2799999999997s)]
*  all night long. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3503.52s)]
*  You might not know this, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3505.04s)]
*  but through different phases of sleep, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3506.08s)]
*  every night your body's needs change. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3508.56s)]
*  Sometimes you want it warmer, sometimes colder. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3510.92s)]
*  That's why you throw the sheets off. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3512.68s)]
*  That's why you pull them around you [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3514.08s)]
*  other parts of the night. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3515.44s)]
*  You don't have to do that anymore with 8 Sleep [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3516.88s)]
*  because it automatically keeps things [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3518.2s)]
*  exactly where you want them [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3520.04s)]
*  throughout your entire night's sleep, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3521.44s)]
*  what's called the sleep cycle. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3523.48s)]
*  And it's been studied, it's clinically proven [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3525.36s)]
*  to increase quality sleep time every night [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3526.96s)]
*  that improves your recovery time from physical exertion, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3529.96s)]
*  makes you a little sharper, makes your health better. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3532.28s)]
*  It learns and adapts to your sleep patterns over time [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3535.4s)]
*  and then automatically adjust temperatures [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3538.0800000000004s)]
*  throughout the night through each phase of your sleep. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3540.0400000000004s)]
*  And it does this independently [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3542.7200000000003s)]
*  for up to two people in a bed. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3545.4s)]
*  So each person can have a tailor-made sleep. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3547.32s)]
*  It really helps. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3552.2400000000002s)]
*  People here absolutely love it, 8 Sleep. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3553.1600000000003s)]

*  Why do you think it became verboten [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3569.64s)]
*  to ask any questions about this one category of medicine? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3572.04s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3575.48s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3576.6s)]
*  It was a religious fervor that scared me. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3577.44s)]
*  I didn't understand. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3580.04s)]
*  I have exactly the same view [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3580.88s)]
*  that you just articulated on the subject. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3582.0s)]
*  I'm not a zealot either way. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3584.0s)]
*  But the zealotry was 100% on the other side [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3586.16s)]
*  and it was really scary. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3588.2000000000003s)]
*  And it ended friendships that divided families. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3589.6s)]
*  It was like, I've never seen anything like it. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3591.08s)]
*  What was that? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3593.04s)]
*  I think as a public health effort, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3594.4799999999996s)]
*  I understand the public health mission, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3599.04s)]
*  which is to sort of work on the health [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3601.08s)]
*  of the entire population. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3602.7599999999998s)]
*  And so you're willing to kind of simplify things [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3604.0s)]
*  and put out messaging that may not be completely scientific [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3606.7599999999998s)]
*  in order to get people to do stuff, right? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3609.9199999999996s)]
*  Which is what happened during COVID. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3611.64s)]
*  Oh, you lied and manipulated people? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3612.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, that, yeah. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3614.0s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3615.72s)]
*  No, but I think lying is wrong. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3616.56s)]
*  Lying is wrong, period. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3617.72s)]
*  We need informed consent. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3619.52s)]

*  you're supposed to say, if I give you this drug, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3622.6400000000003s)]
*  here's the benefits and here's the risks. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3624.76s)]
*  It's really clear we're supposed to do that in medicine. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3628.0s)]
*  It's called informed consent. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3630.48s)]
*  Required to do that. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3631.32s)]
*  Yeah, and we should have informed consent [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3632.1600000000003s)]
*  so people understand. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3633.6s)]
*  Here's the benefit, here's the risk. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3634.7200000000003s)]
*  And you can decide for yourself. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3636.2400000000002s)]
*  But why would, I mean, of course, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3638.04s)]
*  everything became, in the politically charged year [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3640.1600000000003s)]
*  of 2020 election year, became super partisan. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3642.84s)]
*  Okay, so there's that. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3645.52s)]
*  But it was deeper than that [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3647.0s)]
*  because Trump was out there, he was pro-vaccine. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3649.56s)]
*  And then the Biden people, of course, were pro-vaccine. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3651.6s)]
*  But the media became, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3654.48s)]
*  I've never seen that level of intolerance. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3657.3599999999997s)]
*  Anybody who asked any question was not just wrong [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3659.7599999999998s)]
*  or misinformed but evil and deserving of death. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3662.3199999999997s)]
*  As a doctor, is that the view of doctors? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3665.72s)]
*  Anyone who questions this, should die? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3668.9599999999996s)]
*  What is that? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3671.12s)]
*  It's quite astounding, Tucker. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3671.9599999999996s)]
*  It's one of those areas in medicine [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3672.7999999999997s)]
*  where it's become a religion and you can't question it. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3674.0s)]
*  Was that the case when you were in medical school? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3677.2400000000002s)]
*  Not really. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3679.0400000000004s)]
*  Like, I just, I don't understand what happened. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3679.88s)]
*  I think there was a sense that we're being [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3681.88s)]
*  not given this whole story and the whole truth. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3686.92s)]
*  And I think this is true. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3689.28s)]
*  And I think most people don't know this. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3690.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, whenever they attack you for asking questions, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3691.0400000000004s)]
*  then you can be certain you're not getting the whole story. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3693.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3695.5200000000004s)]
*  And people have attacked me. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3696.36s)]
*  There's this group called [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3697.36s)]
*  the American Council on Science and Health, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3698.2000000000003s)]
*  which has gone after me. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3700.1600000000003s)]
*  And they're basically funded by Monsanto [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3701.44s)]
*  and pesticide companies and Pharma [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3704.04s)]
*  and tobacco companies and the fast food companies. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3706.52s)]
*  And so they, you know, like I'm pretty vocal about this. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3709.92s)]
*  They sound like a fun group. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3712.24s)]
*  Yeah, and they sound great. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3713.2s)]
*  And this is one of their strategies. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3714.48s)]
*  So the way in which the food, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3715.84s)]
*  and you asked how this has happened. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3717.6s)]
*  It's not by accident. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3718.72s)]
*  So the food industry and the industry [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3719.68s)]
*  have deliberately set up a series of actions and strategies [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3722.0s)]
*  across all sectors of society to take over the narrative. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3725.32s)]
*  One, they fund most of the research. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3728.84s)]
*  So there's 12 times as much research, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3731.08s)]
*  quote, on nutrition from food industry. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3733.4s)]
*  In other words, the American Beverage Association [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3735.76s)]
*  does a study on artificial sweeteners. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3737.48s)]
*  They find they're fine and they don't, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3739.28s)]
*  they do a study on soda, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3741.08s)]
*  they find it doesn't cause obesity, right? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3742.0s)]
*  That's kind of garbage science. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3743.84s)]
*  And there's eight to 50 times more likely [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3745.1200000000003s)]
*  to show a benefit for their product if they're funding it. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3746.88s)]
*  So they take over the research infrastructure. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3749.6800000000003s)]
*  They take over the professional associations. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3751.6400000000003s)]
*  The American Heart Association [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3753.76s)]
*  receives $192 million a year from pharma and food. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3754.92s)]
*  American Diabetes Association, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3758.76s)]
*  Academy of Nutrition, Dietetics, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3760.08s)]
*  all the major professional associations [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3762.6s)]
*  which we think are independent, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3764.52s)]
*  giving us independent advice, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3765.56s)]
*  are funded and co-opted by these. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3766.96s)]
*  And I mean, it's just down. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3769.3599999999997s)]
*  I wouldn't take that. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3770.8399999999997s)]
*  What about the autism groups? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3771.68s)]
*  Because I always wondered, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3773.96s)]
*  there's been this massive increase in autism. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3774.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know what's causing it. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3776.24s)]
*  It's not genetic. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3777.16s)]
*  No. That's not true. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3778.0s)]
*  It's not because we've broadened the classification [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3778.8399999999997s)]
*  of autism. No, no, no. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3780.3599999999997s)]
*  That's just silly. No, it's not better [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3781.2s)]
*  just to interject. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3782.04s)]
*  It's 1,000%. I mean, I've- [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3782.8799999999997s)]
*  Right, okay, right. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3783.72s)]
*  So, and it's a life-ending crisis. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3784.56s)]
*  Yeah, it went from one in 2,500 to one in 26 kids, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3786.44s)]
*  one in 39 kids. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3789.3999999999996s)]
*  We all know people who have autistic children [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3790.24s)]
*  and it really is a tragedy. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3791.9199999999996s)]
*  So there are all these autism groups [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3794.0s)]
*  and they're all incredibly pompous and self-righteous. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3796.2799999999997s)]
*  But all of them have sort of shot down the idea [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3800.16s)]
*  that we should ask any questions [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3802.8799999999997s)]
*  about where this comes from. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3804.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, not all of them. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3805.7599999999998s)]
*  Some are asking- [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3806.6s)]
*  Big ones have. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3807.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well, of course. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3808.2799999999997s)]
*  I know someone who worked on it and I was like, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3809.1s)]
*  what's causing this? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3809.9399999999996s)]
*  Shut up! [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3810.7799999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3811.6s)]
*  It's like, you work in an autism group. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3812.4399999999996s)]
*  Why aren't you interested? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3813.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3814.56s)]
*  So who's funding them? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3815.3999999999996s)]
*  Do you know? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3816.72s)]
*  We should take a closer look. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3817.6s)]
*  I don't know, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3818.56s)]
*  but there's autism groups. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3819.48s)]
*  And then they fund not only professional associations, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3820.76s)]
*  not only they fund nutrition research, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3823.96s)]
*  but they obviously also create these front groups [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3825.28s)]
*  like the American Council on Science and Health [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3828.2000000000003s)]
*  and CropLife and all these nice sounding things. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3829.9s)]
*  American Council on Science and Health [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3833.1600000000003s)]
*  sounds very legitimate. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3834.4s)]
*  It sounds legitimate. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3835.48s)]
*  And you look at these guys, how these guys were in jail. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3836.32s)]
*  Are you against science and health? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3838.04s)]
*  No, but one of these guys was like in jail [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3839.7200000000003s)]
*  for Medicare fraud for $8 million. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3841.38s)]
*  You look at these guys, they're criminals. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3843.8s)]
*  Well, he knows a lot about science and health. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3845.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3846.52s)]
*  And then- [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3847.36s)]
*  Are you serious? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3848.1800000000003s)]
*  And then they fund social groups. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3849.62s)]
*  So this, get this Tucker, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3851.18s)]
*  they fund like the NAACP and the Hispanic Federation. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3852.62s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware of that. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3855.18s)]
*  And I was- [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3856.02s)]
*  So Al Sharpton, that's where he got his suits. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3857.5s)]
*  Take it. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3859.3s)]
*  That's right. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3860.14s)]
*  I was with Bernice King in Atlanta. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3860.98s)]
*  Nice woman. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3864.74s)]
*  We were gonna show the movie Fed Up, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3865.58s)]
*  which was about childhood obesity [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3867.22s)]
*  and how our sugar industry was causing this [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3868.9s)]
*  and our food industry was causing this. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3871.46s)]
*  And she said, nonviolence is just not nonviolence to others, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3873.18s)]
*  but it's nonviolence to yourself. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3876.74s)]
*  And I think this is important. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3878.52s)]
*  And I wanna show this film in the King Center. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3879.64s)]
*  So I said, great. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3882.24s)]
*  And so a few days later, she called me back, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3883.24s)]
*  said, Mark, can't do it. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3884.68s)]
*  I said, why? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3885.84s)]
*  Coca-Cola funds the King Center. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3886.8s)]
*  And obesity is not a problem in the black community. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3889.36s)]
*  You know, if you look at African Americans in the 60s, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3891.88s)]
*  they were healthier than white Americans. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3896.28s)]
*  If you look at that movie, Amazing Grace [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3897.8s)]
*  with Aretha Franklin, it's a great movie. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3899.2599999999998s)]
*  She was thin and every black person in that condition, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3901.56s)]
*  in Oakland in 1970, was thin. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3904.48s)]
*  And now 85% of African American women are overweight. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3906.72s)]
*  It was LA, I think, not Oakland. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3909.72s)]
*  Really, was it LA? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3911.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3912.6s)]
*  Was she recording the gospel album? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3913.44s)]
*  It was, yeah, it was the Amazing Grace. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3914.72s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3916.7999999999997s)]
*  It was a great documentary. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3917.64s)]
*  Oh, it's the most incredible album, too. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3918.8799999999997s)]
*  So they fund social groups to help oppose things [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3921.3999999999996s)]
*  that they don't want, like soda taxes. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3924.56s)]
*  Or they fund, like, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3925.68s)]
*  which is one of the premier children's hospital in the world. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3928.3999999999996s)]
*  CHOP was going to actually come out in favor of a soda tax, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3930.52s)]
*  but Coca-Cola gave them $10 million. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3934.3999999999996s)]
*  They pulled back. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3936.44s)]
*  This is the kind of stuff they do. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3937.52s)]
*  They fund science, they co-opt professional associations, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3939.44s)]
*  they fund the social groups, they create front groups, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3944.0s)]
*  and they're huge lobbyists. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3947.96s)]
*  And so they're very deliberate in how they do this. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3949.2799999999997s)]
*  In fact, it was illegal. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3951.52s)]
*  They got a huge lawsuit against it [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3953.3599999999997s)]
*  from Secretary, Attorney General of Washington State [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3955.0s)]
*  because they colluded, a lot of the food industry groups [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3958.3599999999997s)]
*  colluded to fight against GMO labeling, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3960.94s)]
*  which they wanted to do in Washington. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3963.04s)]
*  America and Syria are the only countries [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3966.2s)]
*  that don't allow GMO labeling. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3968.0s)]
*  It's a pretty good company. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3969.4399999999996s)]
*  Syria's got bigger problems. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3971.48s)]
*  China and Russia are transparent about this, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3972.68s)]
*  and they're not known for their transcripts. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3974.72s)]
*  They're not allowed in Russia. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3975.56s)]
*  And so basically, they funded this campaign [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3976.68s)]
*  for a ballot initiative to defeat the GMO labeling. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3979.6s)]
*  And they won, but they did it illegally, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3982.52s)]
*  and they spent huge amounts of money doing it, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3984.64s)]
*  and they were then fined and had the biggest fine ever, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3986.2799999999997s)]
*  which was trivial for them. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3989.2s)]
*  It was like $18 million or something that they had to pay, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3990.3999999999996s)]
*  but it was trivial. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3992.9599999999996s)]
*  They got a big slap on the wrist for doing this, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3993.96s)]
*  but they won. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3996.2000000000003s)]
*  Same thing in California. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3997.1200000000003s)]
*  When Jerry Brown was governor, and he was governor moonbeam. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=3998.04s)]
*  I mean, he has as much left as you can get. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4000.6000000000004s)]
*  And there were soda taxes being passed [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4002.84s)]
*  all around California, and the soda industry got together. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4004.6400000000003s)]
*  American Beverage Association, they said, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4007.04s)]
*  we're gonna create a ballot measure [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4008.8s)]
*  that's gonna require a two-third majority [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4010.6400000000003s)]
*  for every vote in any state or local government [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4012.2400000000002s)]
*  for anything. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4016.0s)]
*  It would basically paralyze the government of California [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4016.84s)]
*  if they passed this ballot measure. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4019.8s)]
*  And they were funding it with millions of dollars, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4022.2s)]
*  had nothing to do with food. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4024.0s)]
*  They said, look, Jerry, we're gonna pull this ballot measure, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4025.12s)]
*  but you've gotta put in a permanent ban [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4027.64s)]
*  on soda tax in California. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4029.08s)]
*  And he did. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4030.64s)]
*  That's what's going on behind the scenes. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4032.0s)]
*  That's how this works. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4033.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a permanent ban on soda taxes? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4034.16s)]
*  In California. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4035.3999999999996s)]
*  There's no permanent ban on any other kind of taxes. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4036.44s)]
*  So that's also what bothers me is I do think [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4038.8799999999997s)]
*  there should be one standard for everyone [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4041.58s)]
*  in every category, because we're all American citizens. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4043.52s)]
*  Nobody should be exempt from taxes, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4046.04s)]
*  very much including college endowments. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4048.68s)]
*  And nobody should be exempt from lawsuits [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4050.96s)]
*  unless all of us are. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4052.48s)]
*  And so I don't understand. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4053.52s)]
*  One of the reasons orthopedic surgeons [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4054.76s)]
*  don't do knee replacements drunk [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4055.96s)]
*  is they can be sued for it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4057.2s)]
*  But drug makers, for a certain category of drug, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4058.84s)]
*  have blanket immunity. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4062.56s)]
*  Where do I get blanket immunity granted by Congress? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4063.86s)]
*  Because I don't. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4066.16s)]
*  I wish, that would be nice. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4067.0s)]
*  How do we get that? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4068.16s)]
*  So I don't, okay, I don't understand the thinking. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4069.0s)]
*  Give me $20 million, I'll donate. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4070.8s)]
*  Maybe I can get that for you. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4072.28s)]
*  No, but this is absolutely nuts. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4073.12s)]
*  It is. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4075.6s)]
*  How does one category of product [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4076.44s)]
*  have blanket immunity from, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4079.04s)]
*  statutorily blanket immunity, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4081.28s)]
*  and they're like, well, we provide a vital service? [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4083.76s)]
*  Well, everybody who works thinks he provides a vital service. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4086.64s)]
*  Who doesn't think he's providing, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4090.08s)]
*  you think you're providing a vital service? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4090.96s)]
*  I do. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4092.84s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4093.66s)]
*  I mean, you want it to incentivize innovation. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4094.5s)]
*  You want to incentivize science. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4096.16s)]
*  You want to accelerate things that may be really necessary [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4097.62s)]
*  in ways that are probably not possible [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4101.12s)]
*  within the normal course of how we develop drugs. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4103.94s)]
*  Well, then let's do tort reform. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4106.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4107.68s)]
*  How about we all benefit from it? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4108.94s)]
*  Vaccines, some of them were not that profitable, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4110.18s)]
*  and some are very profitable. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4113.22s)]
*  But what's happened is that in 1980, I think it was 86, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4115.9s)]
*  the US government indemnified vaccine makers. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4120.38s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4123.34s)]
*  So that meant that they could make vaccines [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4124.18s)]
*  and never be sued, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4126.14s)]
*  and they created a vaccine court to deal with vaccine injury. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4126.96s)]
*  And they spent over $5 billion in vaccine injuries. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4129.26s)]
*  So the drug companies paid for over $5 billion? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4131.86s)]
*  No, no, no, the US taxpayers paid. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4133.82s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4135.46s)]
*  So you're saying that the drug companies [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4136.42s)]
*  can never be sued, but if they are sued, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4138.9400000000005s)]
*  taxpayers have to pay the damages. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4140.26s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4141.66s)]
*  It's a federal vaccine court. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4142.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4143.320000000001s)]
*  So that's the biggest scam I think I've ever heard of ever. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4144.16s)]
*  I mean, in a way, I understood the thinking behind it, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4146.38s)]
*  because you want to incentivize rapid development of drugs [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4148.58s)]
*  that aren't going to be that profitable. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4151.900000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4153.58s)]
*  So, but it turns out that many of these drugs are profitable, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4154.42s)]
*  like rotavirus, which is a new vaccine. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4156.5s)]
*  And when we were kids, there were like eight shots. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4158.740000000001s)]
*  Now there's like 72 shots you get. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4161.22s)]
*  And many countries, for example, don't allow, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4162.9400000000005s)]
*  for example, hepatitis B at birth is a vaccine [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4165.1s)]
*  that we're recommending in America. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4168.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's what you get from IV drugs or sex. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4169.68s)]
*  Now I don't know any newborns [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4172.76s)]
*  that are doing IV drugs or sex. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4174.28s)]
*  And, you know, if you are- [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4176.04s)]
*  Probably not a lot. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4177.360000000001s)]
*  Probably not a lot. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4178.2s)]
*  But in many countries, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4179.02s)]
*  don't actually have it on the vaccine schedule. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4179.860000000001s)]
*  You know, we do. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4181.84s)]
*  And so with rotavirus, for example, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4182.68s)]
*  they profit a hundred billion dollars. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4185.32s)]
*  A hundred billion dollar profit for them. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4186.76s)]
*  That's nuts, right? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4188.64s)]
*  Do you have any idea why the trial bar, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4190.38s)]
*  which has always been one of the most powerful lobbies [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4193.16s)]
*  in Washington, and definitely the most powerful [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4195.56s)]
*  democratic party, haven't said anything about this. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4197.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4199.959999999999s)]
*  So their argument has always been, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4200.799999999999s)]
*  look, if you want safer goods and services, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4201.959999999999s)]
*  you have to apply a penalty to people who are negligent. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4205.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4207.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's what, that's their argument. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4208.66s)]
*  It's not a crazy argument, by the way. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4209.799999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4211.2s)]
*  And Coca-Cola, by the way, for all its faults, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4212.04s)]
*  can be sued if they poison you with a can of Diet Coke. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4214.54s)]
*  That's right. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4216.959999999999s)]
*  So they don't. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4217.799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4218.639999999999s)]
*  So why wouldn't that, and by the way, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4219.459999999999s)]
*  if you're saying, well, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4220.299999999999s)]
*  I can't make enough money selling my product, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4221.32s)]
*  why don't you convince people to buy it then? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4224.08s)]
*  Just convince people that it's a good product [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4225.76s)]
*  and they'll probably pay for it. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4227.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4229.320000000001s)]
*  I understand that. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4230.16s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't a completely stupid idea, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4231.0s)]
*  but it's ended up being a bit of a disaster. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4232.92s)]
*  And I think all we need is better science, good science. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4234.88s)]
*  And I think- [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4237.400000000001s)]
*  Well, if you have a government [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4238.240000000001s)]
*  that's like, you must use this product, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4239.06s)]
*  you have, you've got no choice, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4240.68s)]
*  we'll punish you if you don't use the product, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4241.64s)]
*  and then you get injured by the product. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4243.18s)]
*  Most people got injured, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4245.240000000001s)]
*  like had no idea they could be injured [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4246.08s)]
*  because nobody told them. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4247.360000000001s)]
*  They do get injured. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4248.2s)]
*  You're told to shut up and just suffer or die in silence, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4249.4400000000005s)]
*  and then you've got no recourse? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4251.780000000001s)]
*  And then the people who sold you the product [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4254.4400000000005s)]
*  at gunpoint become billionaires? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4256.400000000001s)]
*  That seems like a very flawed system. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4258.280000000001s)]
*  It's a bit messed up. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4260.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a bit messed up. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4260.96s)]
*  Kind of a perfect system for the drug. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4262.72s)]
*  But it just sort of underscores [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4264.360000000001s)]
*  the bigger problem in our society, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4266.6s)]
*  which is that we really have [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4268.080000000001s)]
*  multinational and transnational corporations [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4271.200000000001s)]
*  profiting from creating more sickness. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4273.200000000001s)]
*  The food companies create illness, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4275.84s)]
*  the pharma companies pay for the illness, drug treatments, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4277.52s)]
*  and the whole thing just works for them. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4280.160000000001s)]
*  But we have to change this, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4282.12s)]
*  and we can as a federal government change the policies, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4283.8s)]
*  because other countries have done this, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4286.4s)]
*  they've been successful, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4287.68s)]
*  they're winning the war on this problem, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4289.36s)]
*  and we need a focused effort. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4291.08s)]
*  And I think there's so many things [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4292.68s)]
*  that could be done in this administration. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4294.24s)]
*  Okay, so tell us about Bobby Kennedy, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4295.5599999999995s)]
*  for viewers who haven't followed this for a long time, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4297.64s)]
*  you've known him for a long time, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4299.72s)]
*  you wrote a book with him, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4300.96s)]
*  he's not just like some guy you met at a cocktail party. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4301.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4303.5199999999995s)]
*  You know him really well. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4304.36s)]
*  You told me at dinner last night [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4305.2s)]
*  you were just staying with him. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4306.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4307.32s)]
*  Do you wanna say where you're staying, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4308.64s)]
*  because I thought it was hilarious? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4309.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, we were staying at Dr. Oz's house. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4310.4s)]
*  Okay, so you got Mark Hyman, Bobby Kennedy, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4312.8s)]
*  were the Means's there too? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4315.64s)]
*  Cali was there, yeah. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4317.08s)]
*  Cali, Means, and Dr. Oz all staying together. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4318.44s)]
*  Yeah, it was a party. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4320.56s)]
*  So it's a conspiracy of light, I would say. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4321.4s)]
*  But anyway, you know Bobby really well, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4324.2s)]
*  personally and professionally, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4326.04s)]
*  what do you think his strengths are going into this job? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4327.72s)]
*  I think he has the right focus and perspective, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4330.4800000000005s)]
*  which is that we have a crisis, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4334.2s)]
*  which is our chronic disease epidemic, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4336.76s)]
*  it's been neglected by scientific community, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4338.44s)]
*  it's been neglected by the federal government, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4342.080000000001s)]
*  it's bankrupting us, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4344.280000000001s)]
*  it's causing destruction of our environment, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4345.92s)]
*  of our social structures, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4348.120000000001s)]
*  of more academic, competitive, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4349.88s)]
*  global competitiveness of our military, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4351.72s)]
*  and he understands that this needs to be addressed. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4353.400000000001s)]
*  And so I think that's a huge strength. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4355.4400000000005s)]
*  I think he wants to focus on rooting out corruption, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4357.360000000001s)]
*  rooting out conflicts of interest in agencies. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4360.320000000001s)]
*  I think he wants to implement policies [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4362.96s)]
*  that are gonna transform the health of America. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4364.320000000001s)]
*  And we're working on a whole series of different ideas, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4366.84s)]
*  but I think the NIH needs to be reformed. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4369.48s)]
*  They should basically fund nutrition research [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4372.32s)]
*  around chronic disease, which they don't, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4375.4s)]
*  very small amount of money goes to that. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4376.879999999999s)]
*  Really, they still don't. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4378.24s)]
*  Like 5%, but it's 80% of the diseases we're seeing. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4379.08s)]
*  They should have a mandate, for example, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4382.5599999999995s)]
*  that all medical schools and academic institutions [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4384.36s)]
*  that receive federal funding from any source [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4387.4s)]
*  should have a nutrition curriculum, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4389.2s)]
*  and that should be mandated. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4391.0s)]
*  And there's a reason for that, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4392.799999999999s)]
*  because doctors graduating today, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4394.5599999999995s)]
*  my daughter's in medical school, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4396.32s)]
*  she's in fourth year medical school, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4397.48s)]
*  and she's not a single thing on nutrition. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4398.88s)]
*  Like what did you learn? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4400.12s)]
*  Well, I learned a bit of amino acids and fatty acids. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4400.96s)]
*  I mean, what are you gonna tell your patient to have [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4402.72s)]
*  for lunch? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4404.2s)]
*  And so zero education, that could be changed. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4406.08s)]
*  Is that true when you were in medical school? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4408.64s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4410.16s)]
*  I learned about quash, churros, corn, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4411.0s)]
*  marasmus, and rickets, and seraphthalmia, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4412.8s)]
*  all these rare diseases from vitamin deficiencies [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4414.84s)]
*  in Africa and protein malnutrition. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4416.96s)]
*  Berry, berry. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4418.88s)]
*  Yeah, berry, berry, and pellagra. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4419.72s)]
*  I'm like, I never seen any of that. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4420.8s)]
*  I didn't see any of that. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4422.92s)]
*  So I think I did see some malnutrition when I was in Haiti, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4424.4800000000005s)]
*  but it was really, really rare. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4427.68s)]
*  And we're not doing this. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4430.0s)]
*  The NIH could do a lot. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4432.0s)]
*  And then the HHS could fund with Medicare [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4433.080000000001s)]
*  nutrition services in medicine, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4436.68s)]
*  which it doesn't pay for now. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4438.84s)]
*  So if you have diabetes or heart disease [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4440.200000000001s)]
*  or auto-diacause diseases, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4442.240000000001s)]
*  very hard to get nutrition services. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4444.200000000001s)]
*  And we at Cleveland Clinic created a lifestyle change [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4445.92s)]
*  program where we got people to work together [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4448.200000000001s)]
*  to change their behavior and change lifestyle. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4451.68s)]
*  It was based on this sort of work I did [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4453.4400000000005s)]
*  with Rick Warren Saddleback Church, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4454.64s)]
*  where we got 15,000 people to lose [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4456.56s)]
*  a quarter million pounds in a year [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4458.320000000001s)]
*  by actually getting healthy together. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4459.92s)]
*  So really it's about behavior change [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4462.88s)]
*  and also what to do. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4464.280000000001s)]
*  So they changed what was in the refineries. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4465.200000000001s)]
*  They got rid of the pancake breakfast, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4466.56s)]
*  the ice cream socials. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4468.04s)]
*  They got everybody jogging for Jesus. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4469.400000000001s)]
*  It was great. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4471.68s)]
*  And then they lost a lot of weight. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4473.04s)]
*  Rick lost a ton of weight. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4474.360000000001s)]
*  They got healthy. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4475.320000000001s)]
*  And we showed how people doing this in groups [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4476.14s)]
*  actually works. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4478.52s)]
*  And this could be funded by the federal government. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4479.360000000001s)]
*  Well, schools used to do that. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4481.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4483.080000000001s)]
*  I don't think they do anymore. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4483.92s)]
*  No. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4485.52s)]
*  So we know actually how to change behavior. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4487.24s)]
*  We know how to change these chronic diseases with food. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4489.0s)]
*  And that needs to be funded. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4491.32s)]
*  Like I said, we don't have evidence-based medicine. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4492.5199999999995s)]
*  We have reimbursement-based medicine. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4494.799999999999s)]
*  There's a company called Virta [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4496.04s)]
*  that reverses type 2 diabetes. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4497.44s)]
*  60% of their patients using a ketogenic diet. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4498.679999999999s)]
*  They do it with a continuous care online model. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4501.16s)]
*  They reverse all the biomarkers for heart disease. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4503.48s)]
*  They get those better. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4505.88s)]
*  They have about 12% weight loss. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4506.92s)]
*  Can you separate this? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4508.799999999999s)]
*  They reverse 60% of diagnosis type 2? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4509.88s)]
*  Yeah, advanced, fairly advanced type 2 diabetes. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4512.639999999999s)]
*  Like insulin dependent? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4514.2s)]
*  100%. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4515.12s)]
*  100% off the medication, the main medication for diabetes. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4516.92s)]
*  They get 90 plus percent off insulin. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4519.32s)]
*  When is, pardon me? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4520.5199999999995s)]
*  They save $6,000 per diabetic patient. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4521.36s)]
*  And if you apply that to the Medicare diabetes population, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4524.2s)]
*  just doing that alone would save $100 billion a year. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4526.84s)]
*  You're not even counting all the amputated limbs and [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4530.2s)]
*  Well, that's what it was saying. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4532.72s)]
*  All the suffering that goes along with it. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4533.5599999999995s)]
*  That's right, yeah. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4534.4s)]
*  So roughly when is the average type 2 [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4535.5599999999995s)]
*  diabetic diagnosed as such? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4539.96s)]
*  Depends. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4541.8s)]
*  I mean, if you're a Pima Indian, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4542.64s)]
*  it could be three years old. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4543.72s)]
*  80% of type 2 Pima Indians by the time they're 30 [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4546.36s)]
*  have type 2 diabetes. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4549.64s)]
*  80? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4550.6s)]
*  80%, 80%. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4551.44s)]
*  In certain communities, it's rampant. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4553.16s)]
*  And in African Americans, it's much higher than whites. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4554.6s)]
*  In Hispanics, it's much higher than whites. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4558.68s)]
*  So the age can vary, but the pre-diabetes starts early. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4559.92s)]
*  So we're measuring with function, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4564.5599999999995s)]
*  or my company Function Health, insulin resistance. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4566.36s)]
*  And we're measuring insulin. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4569.5599999999995s)]
*  And most doctors never measure insulin. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4570.68s)]
*  I asked Quest, how many doctors are measuring insulin? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4572.4s)]
*  Probably less than 1% of the lab. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4575.88s)]
*  Quest is the testing company. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4577.8s)]
*  Yeah, the testing company, yeah. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4578.64s)]
*  Like less than 1% get measurements for insulin, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4579.8s)]
*  which is the single biggest thing [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4582.28s)]
*  we have a problem with in America, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4583.96s)]
*  which is our insulin levels are spiking because of sugar. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4585.4400000000005s)]
*  Insulin when it's high causes you to store belly fat. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4588.76s)]
*  It makes you hungry. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4591.24s)]
*  It locks the fat in your fat cells [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4592.08s)]
*  and slows your metabolism. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4593.400000000001s)]
*  So you're screwed. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4594.84s)]
*  And you get stuck in this vicious cycle [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4596.32s)]
*  where you have hungry fat that makes you eat more, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4597.92s)]
*  that makes you want to exercise less. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4599.92s)]
*  And you get in this cycle of waking. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4601.2s)]
*  Nobody wakes up any every day and go, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4602.8s)]
*  I want to be diabetic. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4603.96s)]
*  I want to be overweight. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4604.8s)]
*  Nobody says that. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4605.96s)]
*  They're being- [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4607.08s)]
*  Well, people do wake up craving sugar cereal and pancakes. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4607.92s)]
*  Exactly, because their metabolism and biochemistry [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4610.4800000000005s)]
*  has been hijacked by the food industry. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4612.8s)]
*  How long does it take to get out of that cycle? [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4614.52s)]
*  Very quick, very quick. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4616.0s)]
*  Like how quick? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4617.08s)]
*  Well, I- [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4618.04s)]
*  Let's say you're on a typical American diet [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4618.88s)]
*  and you're waking up with frosted flakes, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4620.72s)]
*  getting some kind of big sandwich [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4624.04s)]
*  and then having pasta for dinner. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4625.280000000001s)]
*  You're doing that for 10 years. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4626.76s)]
*  How long does it take you to get out of the cycle? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4628.0s)]
*  I actually done this with my patients for decades. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4630.0s)]
*  And I created a program called the 10 Day Detox Diet. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4632.56s)]
*  And essentially it's 10 days of treating food addiction. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4636.4400000000005s)]
*  And I wrote a book about it called the 10 Day Detox Diet. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4641.200000000001s)]
*  I have an online program starting actually in January. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4643.240000000001s)]
*  If you'll go to 10daydetox.com. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4645.64s)]
*  And essentially it guides people through how to reset [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4647.6s)]
*  your biochemistry, your hormones, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4650.240000000001s)]
*  your gut microbiome, metabolism, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4651.76s)]
*  very quickly through food. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4654.280000000001s)]
*  So one of these patients I had in Cleveland Clinic, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4655.76s)]
*  she started the program. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4658.320000000001s)]
*  Within three days she was off her insulin. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4660.68s)]
*  So the cravings go away in two or three days. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4663.24s)]
*  You feel shitty for two or three days [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4664.839999999999s)]
*  and then you start reducing symptoms. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4666.719999999999s)]
*  And what happens is when you take out the bad stuff [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4668.759999999999s)]
*  and put in the good stuff, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4671.28s)]
*  you see changes across your whole system. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4673.0s)]
*  Because when I talk about food as a root cause, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4675.36s)]
*  it's a root cause for so many of the things [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4678.32s)]
*  people are suffering from. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4679.679999999999s)]
*  So depression and autoimmune diseases and gut issues. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4680.5199999999995s)]
*  Anger. Anger. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4684.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's amazing. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4685.839999999999s)]
*  And we know- [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4687.4s)]
*  Sugar causes anger. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4688.24s)]
*  Yes, actually the data on this is pretty interesting. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4690.12s)]
*  What is that? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4691.4s)]
*  Pretty interesting. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4692.2s)]
*  So the amygdala is the reptile brain, fight or flight. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4693.04s)]
*  It's your reptilian lizard brain. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4696.5599999999995s)]
*  We all have one. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4699.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4700.04s)]
*  And we have a frontal lobe, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4700.88s)]
*  which is the grownup in the room. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4703.32s)]
*  So you've got the reptile kind of, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4705.12s)]
*  and you've got the grownup. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4707.88s)]
*  The communication there is important. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4710.12s)]
*  So when you're walking down the street [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4711.839999999999s)]
*  and you see a beautiful woman, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4713.639999999999s)]
*  you say, gee, I'd like to kiss that woman. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4715.88s)]
*  You don't do it because you know it's not a good idea [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4717.36s)]
*  for your marriage, right? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4720.28s)]
*  Right, you have the frontal lobe. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4722.04s)]
*  That's probably not a good idea. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4723.16s)]
*  Gee, I like that car over there. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4724.5199999999995s)]
*  I want to just take that car. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4726.24s)]
*  And my car was stolen from my driveway two days ago. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4727.76s)]
*  It was crazy, but that's another story. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4730.5199999999995s)]
*  But people don't have control over their behavior [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4732.5199999999995s)]
*  because the amygdala and the frontal lobe communication [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4736.48s)]
*  is interrupted by inflammation. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4738.96s)]
*  Inflammation in the brain is the root cause [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4741.36s)]
*  of so many brain issues. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4744.48s)]
*  So depression is inflammation, autism is inflammation, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4745.76s)]
*  ADD is inflammation, Alzheimer's is inflammation [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4749.04s)]
*  in the brain. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4751.4s)]
*  And Chris Palmer is a Harvard psychiatrist [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4752.24s)]
*  who wrote a book called Brain Energy talking about this [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4754.28s)]
*  and how he cured schizophrenia using a ketogenic diet, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4756.28s)]
*  getting people off of sugar. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4759.56s)]
*  Curing schizophrenia? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4761.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4762.0s)]
*  So I'm saying these things that sound like crazy, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4764.04s)]
*  heretical, we can reverse Alzheimer's, reverse diabetes. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4767.48s)]
*  Well, they are heretical, but by definition, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4770.12s)]
*  they're heretical. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4772.56s)]
*  It doesn't mean they're crazy though. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4773.4s)]
*  No, I mean, the science is there. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4774.44s)]
*  It's like if you actually look online, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4775.68s)]
*  there's a National Library of Medicine database [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4778.16s)]
*  called PubMed, anybody can search it. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4780.36s)]
*  And you can look at these things and you can look them up. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4782.96s)]
*  They're online, there's studies done. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4785.5199999999995s)]
*  There's plenty of studies, but they don't translate into. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4787.68s)]
*  So it sounds like you said so far [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4790.04s)]
*  the ketogenic diet can cure diabetes. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4792.12s)]
*  Diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4794.92s)]
*  And now schizophrenia. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4797.04s)]
*  Schizophrenia, yeah. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4798.08s)]
*  So will you describe the ketogenic diet just to be? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4799.08s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4803.04s)]
*  So basically this is something that was developed [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4803.88s)]
*  for epilepsy years ago [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4805.4s)]
*  because when no drugs work for epilepsy, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4806.92s)]
*  neurologists realize that if they put people on a diet [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4809.04s)]
*  where their brain was just running on ketones, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4811.68s)]
*  which is the fuel instead of sugar that the body can run on. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4813.68s)]
*  Remember as they were hybrid AC, DC, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4816.76s)]
*  the gasoline is carbs [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4819.56s)]
*  and the hybrid electric clean burning fuel is ketones. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4821.8s)]
*  So when you switch to ketones, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4824.4800000000005s)]
*  it activates the brain's repair systems. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4826.08s)]
*  It improves mitochondrial function. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4829.88s)]
*  It reduces inflammation. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4831.4400000000005s)]
*  It helps cognitive function at every level. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4832.96s)]
*  So I've seen it work from autism to Alzheimer's [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4835.48s)]
*  to schizophrenia, to depression. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4838.919999999999s)]
*  This is just an all protein diet. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4841.679999999999s)]
*  It's not all protein, it's fat. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4843.04s)]
*  It's actually 75% fat. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4844.759999999999s)]
*  Olive oil, avocados, nuts and seeds, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4847.599999999999s)]
*  animal fats, dairy fats. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4850.28s)]
*  And it basically should be a healthy version of it [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4852.12s)]
*  because you can eat bacon and that's not a good idea. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4854.32s)]
*  But you can do healthy ketogenic diets [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4856.759999999999s)]
*  that actually improve health and reverse disease [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4858.879999999999s)]
*  and work across all these things. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4862.24s)]
*  So sugar is really driving this big problem, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4863.76s)]
*  sugar and starch. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4865.84s)]
*  And by the way, flour, bagel. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4866.68s)]
*  I mean, I had a little a lecture the day [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4868.96s)]
*  and a woman said, I had a bagel for breakfast [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4873.0s)]
*  and I noticed I had a glucose monoroma, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4875.16s)]
*  sugar spike 70 points. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4876.52s)]
*  She's got a metabolic problem [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4878.72s)]
*  and you can start to see when you eat these foods, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4880.2s)]
*  your body gets dysregulated. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4882.4800000000005s)]
*  And when you use a diet that actually shuts off [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4884.76s)]
*  this cravings that repairs the metabolic dysfunction, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4886.88s)]
*  that improves insulin sensitivity, it doesn't take long. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4889.8s)]
*  So it's shocking in five or 10 days, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4893.36s)]
*  we get a 70% reduction from all symptoms and all diseases [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4896.32s)]
*  by people just changing their diet. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4899.4s)]
*  And most people Tucker don't connect how they feel [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4900.8s)]
*  with what they're eating. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4903.36s)]
*  They don't make the connection. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4904.64s)]
*  And so they think they're suffering from all these problems [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4906.04s)]
*  that are related to what they're eating. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4909.2s)]
*  Why is it so hard for people to maintain a ketogenic diet? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4910.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's a very extreme diet. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4914.64s)]
*  I don't think you need to be so extreme. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4915.599999999999s)]
*  Like a 10 day detox is not keto, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4916.72s)]
*  but it does like probably 80 or 90% of the benefit. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4918.28s)]
*  So you get to eat more starchy foods. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4921.2s)]
*  Let's just say you just said I'm going on a keto diet [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4922.84s)]
*  from now until I die. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4924.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, probably what you wanna do is use it [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4926.04s)]
*  to fix the problem and then come off it. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4929.400000000001s)]
*  We were always doing this historically [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4931.68s)]
*  because we were hunting and gathering. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4933.52s)]
*  And sometimes we didn't hunt and gather very well. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4935.32s)]
*  We couldn't find anything. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4937.24s)]
*  So we would switch into burning fat [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4938.08s)]
*  because we probably have 2,500 calories of sugar [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4940.16s)]
*  stored in our muscles. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4943.24s)]
*  That doesn't last very long. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4944.08s)]
*  That'll last a day. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4945.12s)]
*  But we probably have 30, 50, 60, 100,000 calories of fat [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4946.56s)]
*  in our body because we just naturally have fat in our body. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4950.92s)]
*  And that's a great source of fuel. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4953.76s)]
*  So what happens is the body starts to break down the fat [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4955.8s)]
*  and uses that. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4958.36s)]
*  And that's what happens when we overnight fast [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4959.24s)]
*  or we do a ketogenic diet, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4961.24s)]
*  you slip into this alternative metabolic pathway. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4963.04s)]
*  And that pathway is incredibly helpful for longevity. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4966.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a power for reversing chronic diseases. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4970.88s)]
*  And across all these diseases, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4973.08s)]
*  we're seeing the same thing happen. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4974.6s)]
*  So really at the bottom line here is that sugar and starch [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4975.96s)]
*  is the problem in America. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4979.04s)]
*  And it's in every processed food. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4980.32s)]
*  It's in what people are eating every day. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4981.759999999999s)]
*  And people have no idea how much they're consuming. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4983.679999999999s)]
*  So if you take out all the sugar and all the starch, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4986.4s)]
*  is that the same as keto? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4988.639999999999s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4990.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, for example, if you can take out ultra processed food [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4991.5599999999995s)]
*  and you can stop your liquid sugar calories, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4995.28s)]
*  if you can eat more good fats, eat good quality protein, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4997.36s)]
*  lots of fruits and vegetables, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=4999.48s)]
*  most of our problems will go away. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5000.5199999999995s)]
*  This is not complicated science. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5002.0s)]
*  And so you don't have to be super extreme. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5004.16s)]
*  But if you are in an extreme situation [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5006.28s)]
*  and you have an extreme disease [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5008.24s)]
*  and you're far end at the end spectrum of type 2 diabetes, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5009.44s)]
*  yeah, you might need to do that for a while [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5012.04s)]
*  till you fix your metabolism. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5013.48s)]
*  So once you fix your metabolism. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5015.04s)]
*  Does the metabolism return to balance? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5015.879999999999s)]
*  100%. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5018.36s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5019.32s)]
*  I mean, you've got, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5020.16s)]
*  like I showed you the picture last night of that woman, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5021.48s)]
*  she had type 2 diabetes, she had heart failure, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5023.5599999999995s)]
*  she had hypertension, she had kidneys failing, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5025.599999999999s)]
*  she had fatty liver. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5027.44s)]
*  She changed her diet. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5028.759999999999s)]
*  In three months, she was off all her medications, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5029.759999999999s)]
*  off all her insulin, reversed her diabetes, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5031.599999999999s)]
*  reversed her heart failure, reversed her kidney failure, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5033.24s)]
*  reversed her liver failing. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5034.919999999999s)]
*  She was on her way to a heart and kidney transplant. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5036.08s)]
*  It's not a patient who's like just slightly broken. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5037.6s)]
*  She's 66 on her way out. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5040.360000000001s)]
*  And in a year, she lost 116 pounds [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5042.68s)]
*  and off all her medication. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5044.64s)]
*  And it wasn't through rocket science [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5045.92s)]
*  or through some great new advance in medicine. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5047.6s)]
*  It was just through applying the basic principles [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5051.400000000001s)]
*  of nutrition and how the system works. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5053.360000000001s)]
*  Can you take pretty much, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5054.92s)]
*  so like any insulin dependent patient in his 50s, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5056.4400000000005s)]
*  can he be cured? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5059.8s)]
*  Type 1, no. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5061.08s)]
*  Type 1 is in autoimmune disease. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5061.92s)]
*  I understand. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5063.280000000001s)]
*  No, I'm sorry, I'm type 2. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5064.120000000001s)]
*  But type 2, if you're on insulin, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5064.96s)]
*  you can probably get 60 to 70% of those people [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5067.400000000001s)]
*  off of insulin or dramatically lower on insulin. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5070.4800000000005s)]
*  And you can reverse completely diabetes [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5074.64s)]
*  in about 60 to 70% of those patients. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5076.84s)]
*  And this is well-documented science. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5078.76s)]
*  I'm not pulling this out of thin air. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5080.360000000001s)]
*  So why wouldn't that be a goal? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5082.280000000001s)]
*  Well, that's one of the things I think [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5084.280000000001s)]
*  the new administration needs to do is, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5086.92s)]
*  I mean, we spend over a billion dollars a day on diabetes. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5088.92s)]
*  And this is a completely avoidable problem. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5092.88s)]
*  And it is the biggest driver, again, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5094.56s)]
*  of all these problems. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5096.0s)]
*  Diabetes, you're four times likely to get Alzheimer's, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5097.360000000001s)]
*  more likely to get cancer, more likely to get heart attacks. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5099.28s)]
*  All the things are caused by this fundamental problem [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5101.84s)]
*  of sugar and starch in your diet. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5104.28s)]
*  And so I think that the federal government [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5105.84s)]
*  should initiate a diabetes reversal campaign [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5107.400000000001s)]
*  across HHS and Health and Human Services [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5110.68s)]
*  and fund these trials and demonstration projects, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5113.2s)]
*  show this works, and then scale it up. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5115.6s)]
*  Because this is a solvable problem. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5117.64s)]
*  I can't fix Middle East crisis. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5119.32s)]
*  I can't end the war in Ukraine. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5121.84s)]
*  I can't prevent the flu. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5124.24s)]
*  Those are hard, yeah. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5125.08s)]
*  War, but this is a solvable problem. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5125.92s)]
*  The answers are clear, the solutions are clear. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5127.64s)]
*  We did an interview with a woman called Casey Means. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5129.84s)]
*  She's a Stanford-educated surgeon, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5133.24s)]
*  and really one of the most remarkable people I have ever met. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5136.08s)]
*  In the interview, she explained how the food that we eat, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5139.8s)]
*  produced by huge food companies, Big Food, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5143.24s)]
*  in conjunction with Pharma, is destroying our health, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5146.68s)]
*  making this a weak and sick country. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5150.44s)]
*  The levels of chronic disease are beyond belief. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5153.04s)]
*  What Casey Means, who we've not stopped thinking about [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5157.0s)]
*  ever since, is the co-founder [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5159.72s)]
*  of a healthcare technology company called Levels. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5162.24s)]
*  And we are proud to announce today [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5164.92s)]
*  that we are partnering with Levels. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5166.6s)]
*  And by proud, I mean sincerely proud. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5168.4s)]
*  Levels is a really interesting company and a great product. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5171.32s)]
*  It gives you insight into what's going on inside your body, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5174.44s)]
*  your metabolic health. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5177.64s)]
*  It helps you understand how the food that you're eating, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5179.16s)]
*  the things that you're doing every single day, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5181.6s)]
*  are affecting your body in real time. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5183.52s)]
*  And you don't think about it. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5186.0s)]
*  You have no idea what you're putting in your mouth, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5186.92s)]
*  and you have no idea what it's doing to your body. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5188.280000000001s)]
*  But over time, you feel weak and tired and spacey, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5189.96s)]
*  and over an even longer period of time, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5194.88s)]
*  you can get really sick. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5196.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's worth knowing what the food you eat is doing to you. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5197.68s)]
*  The Levels app works with something called [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5202.4800000000005s)]
*  a Continuous Glucose Monitor, a CGM. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5204.240000000001s)]
*  You can get one as part of the plan, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5207.4800000000005s)]
*  or you can bring your own, it doesn't matter. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5208.88s)]
*  But the bottom line is, big tech, big pharma, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5211.0s)]
*  and big food combine together [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5214.28s)]
*  to form an incredibly malevolent force, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5217.2s)]
*  pumping you full of garbage on healthy food [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5220.52s)]
*  with artificial sugars, and hurting you, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5222.56s)]
*  and hurting the entire country. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5225.36s)]
*  So with Levels, you'll be able to see immediately [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5226.6s)]
*  what all this is doing to you. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5228.56s)]
*  You get access to real-time personalized data, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5230.84s)]
*  and that's a critical step to changing your behavior. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5233.2s)]
*  Those of us who like Oreos can tell you firsthand. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5235.88s)]
*  This isn't talking to your doctor at an annual physical, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5239.28s)]
*  looking backwards about things you did in the past. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5241.96s)]
*  This is up to the second information [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5244.5199999999995s)]
*  on how your body is responding to different foods [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5247.84s)]

*  about how you feel, and over time, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5260.32s)]
*  it'll have a huge effect. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5262.16s)]
*  Right now, you can get an additional two free months [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5263.5599999999995s)]

*  So I buy everything you're saying. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5278.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's demonstrably true. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5280.12s)]
*  You can feel it in yourself. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5281.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5282.8s)]
*  And one anomaly does not disprove a general truth, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5284.280000000001s)]
*  but Donald Trump is that one anomaly, I would say. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5289.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5291.8s)]
*  I mean, it's disgusting. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5292.64s)]
*  I don't know if you remember Ubi Blake. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5293.4800000000005s)]
*  He was a musician, and he smoked, and drank, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5294.72s)]
*  and did all these aid crafts. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5299.4400000000005s)]
*  He says, if I wouldn't have known I was gonna live so long, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5300.280000000001s)]
*  I would have taken better care of myself. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5302.280000000001s)]
*  And I think there are people who- [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5304.08s)]
*  I have a father like that. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5306.52s)]
*  I mean, there are people who just like Madame Clamot, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5307.360000000001s)]
*  she lived to 122 years old. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5310.160000000001s)]
*  She smoked, she drank, she ate tons of chocolate. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5312.52s)]
*  She was never married. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5315.08s)]
*  Maybe that was her secret, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5315.92s)]
*  but she was the oldest living human ever. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5316.76s)]
*  And some people just have genes [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5318.68s)]
*  that make them go no matter what. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5320.8s)]
*  And so I would like to see what his blood work says. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5322.56s)]
*  I would like to know what's going on in the hood. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5325.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, that would be amazing, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5327.2s)]
*  and certainly would love to help anybody be healthy. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5328.72s)]
*  I take care of everybody. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5331.08s)]
*  You know, one day in my office I had a Muslim, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5332.48s)]
*  I had a chief rabbi, I had a top Democrat, a top Republican, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5335.639999999999s)]
*  I had a Christian pastor. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5339.24s)]
*  It was like, you know, it was so funny, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5340.88s)]
*  but I'm a doctor, I take care of humans. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5342.28s)]
*  And you know, biology is bipartisan. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5344.12s)]
*  We all are human. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5346.28s)]
*  We all suffer from the same things. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5347.72s)]
*  But there are genetic anomalies. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5349.84s)]
*  Yeah, there are. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5351.599999999999s)]
*  Because I just had an ice cream Sunday with Trump, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5352.44s)]
*  like three days ago. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5355.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5356.32s)]
*  I had an ice cream Sunday, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5358.12s)]
*  and I had to come off the ice cream Sundays for a while. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5359.36s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5360.84s)]
*  Yeah, I gotta get off him. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5361.68s)]
*  But he's 25 years older than I am. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5363.12s)]
*  And I'm not just saying this, I'm not sucking up. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5366.24s)]
*  I wouldn't say anything if this weren't true, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5368.28s)]
*  but the guy's sharp, actually sharp. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5370.12s)]
*  Really precise recall, fast, funny, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5372.8s)]
*  and you know, pretty good shape, 79, chatt. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5376.12s)]
*  That's just a freak of nature thing. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5380.32s)]
*  I think it is, you know, I think it is. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5382.24s)]
*  I mean, I think, you know, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5383.92s)]
*  everybody get healthy, yes, that's my job. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5385.84s)]
*  I'm a doctor. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5387.88s)]
*  But if he's managing and doing great, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5388.72s)]
*  I don't know what can I say. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5390.92s)]
*  But for most of us, that's not gonna work. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5392.72s)]
*  No, no. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5394.360000000001s)]
*  I can feel that it's not gonna work for me either. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5395.2s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5396.52s)]
*  Most of us are more in the human realm. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5397.52s)]
*  He's an anomaly. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5399.4400000000005s)]
*  That's why, sorry, I just had to say that. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5401.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5403.16s)]
*  I was like, yeah, yeah, you're right. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5404.0s)]
*  I don't know if anybody's really had a chance [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5407.28s)]
*  to sit down and talk to him about his health [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5409.24s)]
*  and health risks and how he could do better. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5410.56s)]
*  But you know, I don't know, I don't know how you do, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5412.16s)]
*  how he would do that job at 78 years old. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5414.32s)]
*  But he's crushing it, it looks like. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5416.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5418.2s)]
*  So he's not like, and by the way, most, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5419.84s)]
*  I've known a lot of people who have been president [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5421.88s)]
*  and none of them are kind of normal. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5423.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5426.48s)]
*  But it's an unusual job. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5427.32s)]
*  It takes a lot to get there. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5428.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a certain kind of person. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5429.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5431.0s)]
*  There, I don't know, the last time we had a president [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5431.84s)]
*  die in office, it's been quite some time. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5433.599999999999s)]
*  But it seems to kind of suspend, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5436.24s)]
*  maybe it's the intensity. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5437.84s)]
*  Warden Wilson had a stroke, but that was it. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5438.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, but he made it out of office. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5440.44s)]
*  Well, his wife was president for a while. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5442.88s)]
*  Yeah, we're right. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5444.08s)]
*  Right, well, we have that now, actually. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5444.92s)]
*  But they still keep going, I don't know. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5446.2s)]
*  So you think that after all the powerful forces [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5449.68s)]
*  you've described to raid against him, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5454.8s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy can still win. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5456.12s)]
*  I do, I think what's going on now in America [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5457.96s)]
*  is an awakening. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5460.68s)]
*  I think there's an awareness that the trust [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5461.84s)]
*  in our medical system and science system has been broken [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5464.8s)]
*  and needs to be repaired. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5466.8s)]
*  It needs integrity, it needs someone calling out [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5468.04s)]
*  the conflicts of interest, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5471.2s)]
*  and it needs good science being produced. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5472.32s)]
*  And I think with the understanding that now [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5476.0s)]
*  we're in this crises crisis, that he's so well articulated, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5478.599999999999s)]
*  and people like Casey and Callie on your podcast have done, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5482.04s)]
*  that I've done for decades, that somehow it's getting through. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5485.44s)]
*  That this is never an issue. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5488.599999999999s)]
*  This was never an issue at any, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5490.48s)]
*  I've been crying from rooftops for 30 years. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5492.4s)]
*  I felt like I've been as a voice crying in the wilderness. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5495.48s)]
*  And now it's unbelievable to me to see. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5498.16s)]
*  It must be pretty cool for you to see this. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5500.68s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5502.56s)]
*  And I see that there's an awakening in America, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5503.400000000001s)]
*  that people are sick and tired of being sick and tired. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5505.76s)]
*  They're seeing everybody in their family sick. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5508.16s)]
*  They're seeing the rise of all the diseases. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5510.280000000001s)]
*  They know something's broken. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5511.92s)]
*  They know the drugs and the current system [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5513.0s)]
*  is not fixing it the way it is. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5515.04s)]
*  It needs to be fixed. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5516.16s)]
*  And we need somebody to lead this. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5517.280000000001s)]
*  And I think Bobby has his issues and his controversies [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5519.64s)]
*  and his questions, but at the very heart, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5522.52s)]
*  I think he's focused on the right thing, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5524.84s)]
*  which is focusing on the root causes of our chronic [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5526.8s)]
*  disease epidemic, focusing on the problems [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5529.0s)]
*  with our food system, with our ag system. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5530.68s)]
*  And that is the right thing to be doing. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5532.84s)]
*  And I think the federal government has enormous power [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5534.52s)]
*  to actually change this through a whole series [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5537.12s)]
*  of different actions across different agencies [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5538.92s)]
*  that all can work together to make a difference. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5541.68s)]
*  And I'm thinking this is now going to happen. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5543.64s)]
*  I think we can provide for these things [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5546.24s)]
*  across all the agencies. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5548.56s)]
*  And they're not like hard things, right? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5549.8s)]
*  We can improve SNAP, we can improve school lunches, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5552.12s)]
*  we can improve our dietary guidelines and fund those. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5555.36s)]
*  When we have dietary guidelines for Americans, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5557.72s)]
*  there's no funding for them. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5559.72s)]
*  The Congress mandates that they are produced [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5561.360000000001s)]
*  every five years. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5563.320000000001s)]
*  I met with the guidelines people in HHS [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5564.52s)]
*  and said we have to go around with a tin cup [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5567.280000000001s)]
*  to the other departments to beg for nickels [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5569.16s)]
*  to actually fund our work, because we don't get [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5571.56s)]
*  any federal funding to create the dietary guidelines, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5573.72s)]
*  nor does NAISM, the National Academy of Science, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5576.52s)]
*  Medicine and Engineering, which is supposed to review [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5578.360000000001s)]
*  the literature and be an independent scientific body [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5580.96s)]
*  looking at the nutritional research, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5583.360000000001s)]
*  doesn't have the funding to do basic literature reviews [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5586.16s)]
*  and science reviews to actually inform [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5588.599999999999s)]
*  the dietary guidelines. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5590.5199999999995s)]
*  So there's no money in the process. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5591.64s)]
*  And then there's no money to implement the guidelines [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5593.24s)]
*  to actually create awareness and implementation [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5595.76s)]
*  across America for what we should be eating. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5598.599999999999s)]
*  So the whole system is sort of broken [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5600.72s)]
*  and we need to rejigger that. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5602.72s)]
*  We can find, I don't know how many billions of dollars [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5604.12s)]
*  we spent on forever wars. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5606.24s)]
*  We're talking about a few million dollars. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5608.76s)]
*  A few millions of dollars could make a profound difference [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5610.92s)]
*  in actually getting the right things done. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5613.72s)]
*  So we have the ability to change what's happening [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5615.52s)]
*  in the DOD as well, with the military readiness [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5618.240000000001s)]
*  and performance and performance enhancement. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5621.040000000001s)]
*  I've been working with special ops forces [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5624.0s)]
*  on some of this stuff. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5625.52s)]
*  And the military is starting to understand [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5626.72s)]
*  that this is an issue and shift some of their policies. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5628.72s)]
*  The NIH needs to fund, again, nutritional research. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5631.4400000000005s)]
*  We should probably have a National Institute of Nutrition [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5633.72s)]
*  like many other countries have. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5635.52s)]
*  We shouldn't allow funding for medical schools [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5636.52s)]
*  that don't actually provide nutrition curriculum. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5638.68s)]
*  So we should have our agricultural system [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5640.4800000000005s)]
*  supporting farmers to transition to regenerative agriculture [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5643.72s)]
*  and produce healthier food and revitalize its communities [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5645.92s)]
*  and stop their extreme decline [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5647.84s)]
*  into sort of financial ruin and suicide. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5650.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, why is there a 350% higher risk [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5653.16s)]
*  of suicide in farmers? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5655.4800000000005s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5657.400000000001s)]
*  And that's because of our policies and what we're doing [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5658.240000000001s)]
*  and how they're squeezed. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5660.400000000001s)]
*  So we have across all the agencies, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5661.88s)]
*  such tremendous power to make simple changes [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5663.4400000000005s)]
*  that can really transform America. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5665.9400000000005s)]
*  Front of package labeling. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5667.200000000001s)]
*  We can do front of package labeling, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5668.52s)]
*  inform people about what's in their food [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5669.64s)]
*  like they have in other countries. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5671.200000000001s)]
*  Get out the stuff. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5673.16s)]
*  And the European Union has really clearly identified [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5674.0s)]
*  the most harmful chemicals in our food. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5676.92s)]
*  Get them out of our food. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5678.96s)]
*  I mean, you go to Europe or you go to Canada, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5680.04s)]
*  you don't see the same product with the same ingredients [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5683.599999999999s)]
*  like Froot Loops. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5686.16s)]
*  There's a big 400,000 person petition against Froot Loops [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5687.0s)]
*  because their US product was full of all kinds of dyes [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5689.28s)]
*  and colors, whereas in Canada they use, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5692.48s)]
*  there's carrot dye or use blueberry dye [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5694.76s)]
*  or other things to make it colorful, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5697.28s)]
*  not harmful dyes that are banned in other countries. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5698.86s)]
*  So these companies already do it. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5701.48s)]
*  Why shouldn't they do it in America? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5703.16s)]
*  If you get Kraft Macaroni and cheese in America, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5704.719999999999s)]
*  it's got dyes in it that they don't allow in Europe. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5706.879999999999s)]
*  So the same companies are making the product. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5709.5599999999995s)]
*  They just don't do it here. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5711.639999999999s)]
*  This is cheaper. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5712.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so we need to just enforce these standards [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5713.799999999999s)]
*  and we should adopt the precautionary principle. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5716.44s)]
*  You know, we shouldn't allow things in our food [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5718.679999999999s)]
*  that we don't know are healthy [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5721.5199999999995s)]
*  or that we don't know are good for you. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5722.919999999999s)]
*  If they're harmful, we should know about it. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5726.16s)]
*  So the study should be done to prove [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5728.719999999999s)]
*  they're safe and effective rather than just approving them [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5730.16s)]
*  and then waiting and seeing if they're harmful [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5732.639999999999s)]
*  and then taking them off the market, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5734.34s)]
*  which is kind of what we do. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5735.92s)]
*  It's different than the precautionary principle, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5737.2s)]
*  which is, you're guilty until proven innocent. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5738.88s)]
*  Here, you're innocent to proven guilty, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5741.4s)]
*  which is fine in the court of law for a human being, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5743.7s)]
*  but not for a food additive or chemical [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5745.9s)]
*  that could harm human health. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5747.599999999999s)]
*  What do you do about doctors? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5749.5599999999995s)]
*  I haven't been at the doctor in a long time [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5751.0s)]
*  because I'm so distressed, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5753.44s)]
*  because I've seen so many doctors [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5754.5599999999995s)]
*  recklessly prescribe drugs that have destroyed [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5756.32s)]
*  people's lives. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5758.88s)]
*  Adderall, benzodiazepines, or SSRIs, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5760.72s)]
*  all the stuff. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5764.12s)]
*  It's like, it seems like an incredibly [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5764.96s)]
*  reckless group of people. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5767.2s)]
*  They have no moral authority left from my perspective, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5768.4400000000005s)]
*  but we need doctors with moral authority [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5772.16s)]
*  who practice science. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5774.240000000001s)]
*  Like, how do you change that? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5775.08s)]
*  Listen, I would say, Tucker, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5776.360000000001s)]
*  that most doctors went into medicine to do good. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5777.6s)]
*  I think that's right. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5779.68s)]
*  And there's a- [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5780.68s)]
*  It didn't go because it's easy. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5782.0s)]
*  No, I mean, the well-meaning are often ill-doing, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5783.12s)]
*  and they're caught up in a system [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5784.88s)]
*  that is kind of co-opted them. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5787.879999999999s)]
*  And it took me a while to get deprogrammed. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5791.28s)]
*  I was programmed by medical school. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5793.28s)]
*  I was taught that this is this bastion of science, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5796.28s)]
*  that everything is pure and clean. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5799.599999999999s)]
*  There's no conflict, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5801.24s)]
*  that everything you read in the scientific paper is true, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5802.759999999999s)]
*  that pharmaceuticals are the solution to our problems. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5805.32s)]
*  I mean, this is what we were taught. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5808.679999999999s)]
*  And we were taught- [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5810.48s)]
*  If pharmaceuticals are the solution to our problems? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5811.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5813.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, what did the doctors toolkit? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5814.48s)]
*  It's a knife and a prescription pad. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5815.8s)]
*  That's it. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5818.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5819.64s)]
*  And if you have cancer, it's radiation, right? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5820.4800000000005s)]
*  So basically, we don't have a hell of a lot of tools. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5821.8s)]
*  And if you take away a doctor's prescription pad, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5824.92s)]
*  how do they practice medicine? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5827.4400000000005s)]
*  But I almost never pull out my prescription pad. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5829.280000000001s)]
*  I don't need to, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5831.52s)]
*  because lifestyle and food are the best drugs on the planet. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5832.68s)]
*  They're not like drugs. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5836.04s)]
*  They work better than any other drugs, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5837.04s)]
*  like exercise, diet, sleep. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5838.72s)]
*  These are profoundly foundational to our health. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5840.4800000000005s)]
*  And we have a disease system, not a health system. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5843.12s)]
*  We don't have a medical system [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5846.6s)]
*  that's based on the science of creating health. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5848.92s)]
*  We have a system that's based on the science [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5850.76s)]
*  of diagnosing and treating diseases, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5852.16s)]
*  rather than looking at the root causes. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5853.72s)]
*  So part of the problem is in education. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5854.96s)]
*  And I think doctors wanna do the right thing, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5857.24s)]
*  and they're frustrated. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5859.16s)]
*  And I can tell you, being on the inside, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5860.0s)]
*  because I'm in the clinic for 10 years, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5861.68s)]
*  people come out of the woodwork, like, this is great. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5864.6s)]
*  We want to change. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5866.36s)]
*  We need to understand how to do things differently. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5868.0s)]
*  Toby Cosgrove, who is sort of the most visionary CEO [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5870.04s)]
*  in medicine, he was asked by the Biden administration, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5873.24s)]
*  the Trump administration, everybody to work for him. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5875.76s)]
*  Everybody wants him. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5877.64s)]
*  And he brought Cleveland Clinic to be the number two [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5879.24s)]
*  center of healthcare in the world, Mayo Clinic, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5881.88s)]
*  and him were there in competition. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5884.12s)]
*  He said, Mayo was what you put on your sandwich. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5885.56s)]
*  It was very funny. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5887.44s)]
*  But I met him at the World Economic Forum, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5888.6s)]
*  and I said, Toby, what if I could empty out [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5890.56s)]
*  half your hospitals and cut your angioplasties [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5892.56s)]
*  and bypass it in half? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5894.6s)]
*  And they're the number one heart hospital in the world. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5895.56s)]
*  He said, that would be a great idea. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5897.6s)]
*  I said, why? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5899.2s)]
*  You're going to cut your revenue in half. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5900.04s)]
*  What are you going to do about that? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5901.04s)]
*  He said, we'll figure it out. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5902.08s)]
*  It's the right thing to do. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5903.0s)]
*  So he invited me to come, and I would, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5904.2s)]
*  I mean, like, I didn't want to go to Cleveland, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5906.2s)]
*  and he had a good life, and he says, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5907.5199999999995s)]
*  I want you to come and I'll give you whatever you want, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5909.8s)]
*  but let's do this. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5911.76s)]
*  We need to address chronic disease differently. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5912.679999999999s)]
*  The way we're doing it is wrong. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5914.72s)]
*  We need to think differently. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5915.84s)]
*  And he gave me carte blanche, and we built a center. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5916.76s)]
*  We had done tons of research, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5919.24s)]
*  and we showed that the model works, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5920.96s)]
*  and it really gets into the root of the problem. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5922.24s)]
*  And so there is a shift in medicine. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5925.639999999999s)]
*  There are doctors who are flocking to this. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5927.48s)]
*  There are people who are understanding the system's broken, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5929.96s)]
*  but it's a tough sell for some people [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5931.68s)]
*  because they're so brainwashed. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5933.2s)]
*  It's like, if the Earth is flat, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5934.2s)]
*  you convince the Earth is flat, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5935.32s)]
*  and you can't convince people otherwise. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5936.6s)]
*  And we're still arguing over things like evolution [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5938.44s)]
*  150 years later. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5941.04s)]
*  I mean, we're still arguing over the Earth is flat. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5942.32s)]
*  There's people who are flat Earthers. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5945.48s)]
*  It's like, so this is the problem in medicine. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5947.24s)]
*  There's a scientific paradigm change that needs to happen, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5950.16s)]
*  and doctors are starting to get that this is true. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5952.32s)]
*  And I think it's not that they're trying to do something [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5954.48s)]
*  harmful or bad. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5957.5199999999995s)]
*  They're just stuck in a system, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5958.5199999999995s)]
*  and they need to get liberated. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5959.879999999999s)]
*  And I met with Kathleen Sebelius [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5961.32s)]
*  when I was going around trying to get these policies [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5963.679999999999s)]
*  in Obamacare around lifestyle change. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5965.759999999999s)]
*  She said, this is a great idea. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5967.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, if we have these lifestyle change programs [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5969.08s)]
*  for Medicare, people are gonna get better, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5971.08s)]
*  they're healthier, we're gonna reduce healthcare costs [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5972.5199999999995s)]
*  and improve healthcare outcomes. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5974.839999999999s)]
*  She said, but who's gonna know how to do it? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5976.799999999999s)]
*  I said, don't worry about that, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5978.32s)]
*  because if you pay for it, people will figure it out. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5979.36s)]
*  If you pay for an angioplasty, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5981.4s)]
*  if you pay for an angioplasty, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5983.16s)]
*  doctors are gonna learn how to do angioplasties, right? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5984.24s)]
*  You don't have to worry about that. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5986.68s)]
*  If you pay for a lifestyle intensive change program [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5987.84s)]
*  that works better, then, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5991.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, this woman I was telling you about, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5993.56s)]
*  she had $20,000 of copay. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5995.04s)]
*  I don't know what her other medications cost [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5997.4400000000005s)]
*  for the insurance or the healthcare system, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=5999.96s)]
*  plus she was in and out of the hospital all the time. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6001.8s)]
*  We probably saved the healthcare system a million bucks. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6004.320000000001s)]
*  I got paid $200 a visit. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6007.8s)]
*  We don't get the benefit as doctors [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6010.6s)]
*  for doing the right thing. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6012.4800000000005s)]
*  We get benefit for doing the wrong thing. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6013.52s)]
*  We get benefit for paying more, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6015.4s)]
*  I mean, for doing more, not doing the right thing. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6017.72s)]
*  So it's a reimbursement-based system [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6020.0s)]
*  based on fee for service and throughput, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6021.68s)]
*  not based on outcomes. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6024.5199999999995s)]
*  Imagine if you were making cars, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6025.84s)]
*  and you had a car company that produced cars that didn't work, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6027.5199999999995s)]
*  or you drove off the lot [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6030.32s)]
*  and they just fell apart after a few years, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6032.2s)]
*  or they had to come back constantly to get fixed every month. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6033.5199999999995s)]
*  You wouldn't have a car company. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6036.5599999999995s)]
*  But that's what we do in medicine. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6038.5199999999995s)]
*  No, you wouldn't. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6039.36s)]
*  That's what we do in medicine. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6040.2s)]
*  We have a system that doesn't really fix the problem, [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6041.0199999999995s)]
*  and people are not actually getting the solutions [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6043.48s)]
*  that the science says work, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6046.5199999999995s)]
*  like the things we've been talking about on the show. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6048.16s)]
*  So I think we have a historic opportunity now. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6049.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's fraught, right? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6052.759999999999s)]
*  There's gonna be trillions of dollars at stake here, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6053.799999999999s)]
*  Tucker, trillions of dollars in the food industry, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6057.5199999999995s)]
*  in the ag industry, the fast food companies, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6060.679999999999s)]
*  all these companies are gonna be frightened about this. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6063.799999999999s)]
*  And they are already circling the wagons. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6067.96s)]
*  They're already coming around Washington, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6070.28s)]
*  they're working on discrediting everybody [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6071.84s)]
*  in this administration, they're pushing back hard, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6073.88s)]
*  because they know day of reckoning is coming. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6076.68s)]
*  And I think it's time. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6079.28s)]
*  I mean, the American people [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6080.360000000001s)]
*  should not be the victims of this system. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6081.84s)]
*  Like I said, 93% of us are somewhere in that spectrum [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6083.72s)]
*  of pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6087.0s)]
*  That's frightening to me as a doctor. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6089.72s)]
*  I mean, that's just like, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6091.76s)]
*  when I was in medical school, this wasn't a problem. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6094.08s)]
*  There was no juvenile diabetes [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6096.32s)]
*  that where kids had type 2 diabetes. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6098.360000000001s)]
*  This doesn't exist. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6100.32s)]
*  I'm not that old, I mean, old, I'm not that old. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6102.52s)]
*  I'm still walking. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6104.84s)]
*  Look at the pictures of Woodstock from August of 69. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6105.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6108.4400000000005s)]
*  150,000 shirtless. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6109.6s)]
*  You were there, right? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6111.56s)]
*  You're in the mail. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6112.400000000001s)]
*  You're always born. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6113.240000000001s)]
*  And you can see the ribs all over. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6114.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6116.12s)]
*  So this is not a genetic problem. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6117.52s)]
*  You've got scientists from Harvard saying [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6119.240000000001s)]
*  this obesity is genetic, it's not. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6121.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, there are genetic predispositions. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6123.0s)]
*  So what is that? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6124.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6125.16s)]
*  And what is the celebration of unhealth [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6126.0s)]
*  that you've seen for the last four years [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6127.52s)]
*  and attacking people who try to stay fit as right wing. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6129.96s)]
*  It's a political category to be healthy. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6133.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6135.4800000000005s)]
*  What is that? [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6136.32s)]
*  You mean the body positive movement or you mean? [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6137.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's the most negative thing I've ever seen. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6139.16s)]
*  Of course, it's mislabeled like everything. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6140.96s)]
*  How is it positive to encourage people to be unhealthy? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6142.76s)]
*  I mean, do you know there was a number, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6146.28s)]
*  I think it was in the- [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6149.0s)]
*  Like who's paying for that? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6149.84s)]
*  There was a Washington Post or Wall Street Journal. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6150.68s)]
*  They did a whole sort of series of articles [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6151.76s)]
*  on how the food industry has sort of hijacked the media. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6154.24s)]
*  So they talked about how 40% of the nutritionists [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6156.96s)]
*  who are on social media are paid by the food industry [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6159.96s)]
*  to promote false concepts like, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6163.44s)]
*  don't worry about how many calories you're eating, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6166.12s)]
*  eat whatever you want, indulge yourself. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6167.4s)]
*  It's really quite striking how deliberate their actions are. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6169.44s)]
*  And so I think the sad thing is that people [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6173.6s)]
*  are actually being manipulated by the food system [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6178.04s)]
*  in a way that they can't- [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6181.4800000000005s)]
*  40% of the nutritionists on social media are paid. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6182.56s)]
*  By food companies. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6187.04s)]
*  Yeah, this was an expose, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6187.88s)]
*  I think it was in the Washington Post. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6189.04s)]
*  And it was like, and you see it. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6191.0s)]
*  And so they're not- [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6193.12s)]
*  So Sarah Lee is paying nutritionists. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6195.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know if it's Sarah Lee or who, but it's- [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6197.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6199.44s)]
*  I mean, 40% of the budget [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6200.84s)]
*  of the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6202.16s)]
*  is paid for by the food industry. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6204.48s)]
*  And they have panels where you've got people [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6206.44s)]
*  from McDonald's and Coca-Cola on the panels. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6208.92s)]
*  Okay, so you're saying that most physicians [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6210.48s)]
*  wanna do good in the world in health. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6212.84s)]
*  But if you're, I'm sorry, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6215.759999999999s)]
*  if you're a nutritionist taking money [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6217.08s)]
*  from the baked goods industry. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6220.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6222.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I wanna- [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6224.04s)]
*  But you must know that you're corrupt [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6224.88s)]
*  because that's corrupt. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6226.04s)]
*  That's so obviously corrupt. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6226.88s)]
*  I guess so. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6228.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not taking money from George Soros. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6229.36s)]
*  No. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6230.96s)]
*  And if I were, I would know that I was corrupt. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6231.8s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6233.08s)]
*  So it's how the system's rigged and unfortunately- [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6233.92s)]
*  But the people participating in that system [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6237.719999999999s)]
*  are also culpable, sorry. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6239.36s)]
*  I think so. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6240.84s)]
*  I mean, I think for sure those are nutritionists. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6241.68s)]
*  I think doctors are stuck [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6246.04s)]
*  because they wanted the right thing. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6248.280000000001s)]
*  They don't have the education of what to do. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6249.68s)]
*  They don't know how to do it. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6251.68s)]
*  And they're only told one thing, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6252.72s)]
*  which is these drugs work for these problems [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6254.12s)]
*  and give these prescriptions. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6256.04s)]
*  And like I said at the beginning, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6257.12s)]
*  we've seen dramatic rises in all chronic diseases [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6258.400000000001s)]
*  and an even more dramatic rise [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6260.96s)]
*  in the use of prescription medications for those diseases, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6262.56s)]
*  which were not getting better. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6264.84s)]
*  We're 48th life expectancy. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6265.96s)]
*  We spend more than double any other nation. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6267.76s)]
*  On Joe Rogan, I gave a slide to a friend of mine, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6270.08s)]
*  Callie, and he gave it to Trump, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6272.6s)]
*  or gave it to somebody else that gave it to Trump [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6274.72s)]
*  that he used on Joe Rogan, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6276.5199999999995s)]
*  which showed the life expectancy in America [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6277.5199999999995s)]
*  and the cost of our healthcare expenditures [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6279.5599999999995s)]
*  were completely kind of off the chart. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6282.0s)]
*  So life expectancy is going down. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6284.84s)]
*  Other countries are high. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6286.8s)]
*  We're spending twice as much as anybody else. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6288.12s)]
*  It must be nice to live long enough to be vindicated. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6291.48s)]
*  Van Gogh never got that, but you have. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6294.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, I'm optimistic, Tucker. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6297.68s)]
*  I think we're in a moment where the country [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6300.6s)]
*  is ready for change, where the country understands [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6301.8s)]
*  we have this health crisis, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6304.16s)]
*  where they're willing to sort of make changes. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6305.12s)]
*  And I think if the politicians in Congress [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6307.32s)]
*  understand these issues, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6310.68s)]
*  I think they'll make the right choices. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6311.96s)]
*  I think if they have the support of the American people, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6314.0s)]
*  which I think they do, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6317.8s)]
*  they can make choices that are difficult, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6319.2s)]
*  and often against the people [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6320.76s)]
*  who are funding their campaigns [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6322.84s)]
*  or funding their super PACs. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6323.92s)]
*  And we have to realize we have a bought and paid for system, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6325.68s)]
*  and it's unfortunate, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6329.719999999999s)]
*  but I think that the problem's gotten big enough [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6330.88s)]
*  we have to face it and deal with it. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6333.32s)]
*  Dr. Mark Hyman, thank you very much. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6335.32s)]
*  Appreciate it. My pleasure. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6337.5599999999995s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6343.04s)]
*  I know. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6347.2s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6348.04s)]
*  with everything at stake, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6350.639999999999s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6351.88s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6354.599999999999s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6357.84s)]
*  but it turns out it's happening. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6359.4800000000005s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6361.04s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6361.96s)]
*  but that's a waste of time. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6363.64s)]
*  I'm not in charge of Google. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6364.88s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6366.24s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that's true. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6367.96s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6371.96s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2ABq3UCN0w&t=6374.0s)]
