**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg)
*  Do you drink coffee? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=0.0s)]
*  All the time, nonstop. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=0.84s)]
*  Me too. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2.36s)]
*  Nonstop, nine or 10 cups a day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3.2s)]
*  It's good. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5.28s)]
*  I like coffee. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6.12s)]
*  And I drink it straight until minutes before bed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7.08s)]
*  I do too. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=9.96s)]
*  Oh, do you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=10.8s)]
*  Yes, and we will never drink as much as Voltaire drank. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=11.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=14.24s)]
*  Oh, is that right? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=15.08s)]
*  Like 40 cups, yeah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=15.92s)]
*  Oh, is that right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=16.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, and it worked. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=17.6s)]
*  Okay, so the one thing that we know, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=21.76s)]
*  we heard about the movement of Russian troops [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  into Eastern Ukraine in February of 2022 was, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  it was unprovoked. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  Here's a selection of what we know about that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=33.56s)]
*  The Russian military has begun a brutal assault [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=36.12s)]
*  on the people of Ukraine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=38.36s)]
*  Without provocation, without justification, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=40.32s)]
*  without necessity, this is a premeditated attack. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=43.72s)]
*  Russia's unprovoked and cruel invasion [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=48.0s)]
*  has galvanized countries from around the world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=50.2s)]
*  Russia's unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=53.08s)]
*  Russia conducted an unprovoked war of aggression [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=57.0s)]
*  against Ukraine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=59.64s)]
*  This unprovoked Russian war of aggression [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=60.6s)]
*  has got to be met with strength. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=64.84s)]
*  Vladimir Putin decided, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=67.8s)]
*  unprovoked, to start this war. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=72.0s)]
*  So, was it unprovoked? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=75.52s)]
*  Well, we did hear that a lot of times. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=78.32s)]
*  Yes, we did. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=80.08s)]
*  I actually asked a research assistant of mine [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=80.92s)]
*  to count how many times we heard that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=84.72s)]
*  in the New York Times in that first year [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  from February 2022 to February 2023 [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=89.44s)]
*  in their opinion columns was 26 times unprovoked. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=92.48s)]
*  Of course, things aren't unprovoked that way. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=97.4s)]
*  It's almost a brand name, the unprovoked invasion. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=99.84s)]
*  It's the lazy person's dodge for actually [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=102.44s)]
*  trying to think through what's going on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=108.12s)]
*  And it's very dangerous because it's wrong. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=110.56s)]
*  It gets the whole story completely wrong. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=114.2s)]
*  And it misunderstands the trap that we set for ourselves [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  as the United States to push Ukraine [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=120.4s)]
*  deeper and deeper and deeper into this hopeless mess [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=122.92s)]
*  that they're in right now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=126.2s)]
*  So, in what sense was it provoked? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=127.68s)]
*  Like, what started this? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=129.44s)]
*  Basically, it started very simply, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=131.08s)]
*  which is that the United States government, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=134.0s)]
*  let's not call it the US people, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=137.52s)]
*  they had nothing to do with this, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=139.36s)]
*  but the US government said, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=140.76s)]
*  we're gonna put Ukraine on our side [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=143.56s)]
*  and we're gonna go right up to that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=146.04s)]
*  2,100 kilometer border with Russia [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=147.6s)]
*  and we're gonna put our troops and NATO [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=151.16s)]
*  and maybe missiles, whatever we want [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=154.32s)]
*  because we are the sole superpower of the world [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=156.48s)]
*  and we do what we want. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=159.56s)]
*  And it goes back actually a long way. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=161.32s)]
*  It goes back 170 years. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=165.44s)]
*  The Brits had this idea first, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=167.64s)]
*  surround Russia in the Black Sea region [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=170.04s)]
*  and Russia's not a great power anymore. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=173.76s)]
*  And that was Lord Palmerston's idea in the Crimean War, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=176.56s)]
*  1853 to 1856. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=181.56s)]
*  And the Brits taught us what we know about empire. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=184.32s)]
*  And they basically taught us the idea, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=187.44s)]
*  Russia, it needs an outlet. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  It needs an outlet to the Middle East. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=192.92s)]
*  It needs an outlet to the Mediterranean. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  You surround Russia in the Black Sea. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=197.12s)]
*  You have rendered Russia a second or third rate country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=200.4s)]
*  And Zbigniew Brzezinski, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=205.12s)]
*  one of our lead geo strategists of the current era [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  wrote in 1997, let's do this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=214.72s)]
*  Let's make sure that we basically surround Russia [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=218.68s)]
*  in the Black Sea region. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=222.88s)]
*  And they got this idea that we'll expand NATO [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=224.48s)]
*  so that every country in the Black Sea [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=228.04s)]
*  around Russia is a NATO country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  Right now, well, back then Turkey was a NATO country, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  but we said, okay, we'll get Romania and Bulgaria [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=238.92s)]
*  and we'll get Ukraine and we'll get Georgia. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=243.04s)]
*  Now Georgia, not our Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Georgia of the Black Sea. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=250.0s)]
*  We used to call it Soviet Georgia. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=251.72s)]
*  Yes, Soviet Georgia, if you wanna call it that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=253.04s)]
*  Home of Stalin. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  It's not NATO North Atlantic. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=256.84s)]
*  It's way out there in the Eastern edge [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=260.52s)]
*  of the Black Sea region. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  People can look at a map. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=264.44s)]
*  But we said, yeah, we'll make Georgia part of NATO too. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  And the reason was very clear [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  and Zbigniew Brzezinski was very explicit about it, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=272.32s)]
*  that this is our way to basically dominate Eurasia. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=274.64s)]
*  If we can dominate the Black Sea region, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=278.56s)]
*  then Russia's nothing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=281.92s)]
*  If we make Russia nothing, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  then we can basically control Eurasia, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=285.6s)]
*  meaning all the way from Europe to Central Asia [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=288.36s)]
*  and through our influence in East Asia do the same thing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=292.2s)]
*  And that's American unipolarity. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=296.44s)]
*  We run the world. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  We are the hegemon. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=300.16s)]
*  We are the sole superpower. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=301.24s)]
*  We are unchallenged. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=302.72s)]
*  So that's the idea. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  It's- [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=306.12s)]
*  But why would you want that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  Why would the Brits want that? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=307.92s)]
*  Why does the US State Department want that? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=309.2s)]
*  What about Russia, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=313.24s)]
*  which is not actually much of an expansionist power, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  is so threatening? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=318.76s)]
*  It's not about Russia. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=319.8s)]
*  It's about the US. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=322.12s)]
*  It's about Britain before that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=323.64s)]
*  I think it's a little bit like that old game of risk. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you played that as a kid, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=330.32s)]
*  but the idea was have your peace [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=332.12s)]
*  on every place in the world. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=334.36s)]
*  That was the game. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  And you read the American strategists, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=337.48s)]
*  whether it's Zbigniew Brzezinski, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=340.76s)]
*  although he was a very moderate, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=342.6s)]
*  or the neocons who have run US foreign policy [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  for the last 30 years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=347.36s)]
*  The neocons are very explicit. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  The US must be the unchallenged superpower [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  in every place in the world, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=357.76s)]
*  in every region we must dominate. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=359.44s)]
*  It's quite a load for us American people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=362.56s)]
*  What they say is we are going to be [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=366.52s)]
*  the constabulary duty holder, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=368.84s)]
*  fancy word for saying we'll be the world's policeman. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=373.84s)]
*  They say it explicitly. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  They say that's lots of wars. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=378.44s)]
*  We have to be ready for all these wars. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  To my mind, it's a little crazy, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=382.2s)]
*  but their idea was after the end of the Soviet Union, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=384.64s)]
*  well, now we run the world. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=389.24s)]
*  And to come back to Russia, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=391.68s)]
*  the idea was, well, Russia's weak, it's down. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  It's we're the sole superpower. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=398.8s)]
*  They're on their back or on their knees, whatever it is. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=401.24s)]
*  And now we can move NATO where we want [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=405.2s)]
*  and we can surround them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=407.24s)]
*  And the Russians said, please don't do that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=408.52s)]
*  Don't bring your troops, your weapons, your missiles [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  right up to our border. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=417.12s)]
*  It's not a good idea. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  And the US, I was around in those years, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=419.56s)]
*  involved in Russia and in Central Europe. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=423.68s)]
*  The US was, we don't hear you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=427.52s)]
*  We don't hear you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  We do what we want. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  They kept pushing inside the US government in the 1990s [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=432.68s)]
*  when this debate was going, should NATO expand? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=437.4s)]
*  Some people said, yeah, but we told Gorbachev [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=441.36s)]
*  and we told Yeltsin we weren't going to expand at all. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=444.76s)]
*  No, come on, Soviet Union's done. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  We can do what we want. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=450.0s)]
*  We're the sole superpower. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=451.08s)]
*  Clinton bought into that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=453.04s)]
*  That was Madeleine Albright's line. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=454.36s)]
*  NATO enlargement started. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=457.56s)]
*  And our most sophisticated diplomats, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=459.76000000000005s)]
*  we used to have diplomats at the time. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=465.04s)]
*  We don't have them anymore, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  but we used to have diplomats like George Kennan said, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=467.88s)]
*  this is the greatest mistake we could possibly make. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=470.88s)]
*  We had a defense secretary, Bill Perry, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=474.76s)]
*  who was Clinton's defense secretary who agonized, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=477.0s)]
*  God, I should resign over this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=480.36s)]
*  This is terrible. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  But he was outmaneuvered diplomatically [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  by Richard Holbrooke and by Madeleine Albright. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=485.8s)]
*  And Clinton never thought through anything systematically [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=488.96s)]
*  in my opinion. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=492.92s)]
*  And so they decided, okay, Hungary, Poland, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=493.76s)]
*  Czech Republic, first round. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=496.92s)]
*  And then Brzezinski in a 1997 article [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=498.8s)]
*  in Foreign Affairs Magazine, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=503.2s)]
*  which is kind of the bellwether of foreign policy, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=505.36s)]
*  wrote a strategy for Eurasia [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=510.04s)]
*  where he laid out exactly the timeline [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=512.96s)]
*  for this US expansion of power. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=516.48s)]
*  And he said, late 1990s, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=520.28s)]
*  we'll take in Central Europe, Hungary, Poland, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=522.72s)]
*  Czech Republic. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=525.84s)]
*  By the early 2000s, we'll take in the Baltic States. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=527.04s)]
*  Now that's get close to Russia. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=530.48s)]
*  By 2005 to 2010, we'll invite Ukraine [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=532.64s)]
*  to become part of NATO. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  So this wasn't some flippant thing. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=538.96s)]
*  This was a long-term plan [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=541.48s)]
*  and it was based on a long-term geo strategy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  Now the Russians are saying, are you kidding? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  We wanted peace. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=551.08s)]
*  We ended the Cold War too. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  You didn't just defeat us. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=555.36s)]
*  We said no more. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=556.88s)]
*  We disbanded the Warsaw Pact. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=559.12s)]
*  We wanted peace. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=562.0400000000001s)]
*  We wanted cooperation. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=563.24s)]
*  You call it victory. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  We just wanted to cooperate. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  I know that for a fact [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=567.56s)]
*  because I was there in those years. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  What Gorbachev wanted, what Yeltsin wanted. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=571.52s)]
*  They didn't want war with the United States [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=573.88s)]
*  nor were they saying we're defeated. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=576.0s)]
*  They were saying, we just wanna cooperate. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  We wanna stop the Cold War. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=579.92s)]
*  We wanna become part of a world economy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=581.7199999999999s)]
*  We wanna be a normal economy. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=583.8s)]
*  We wanna be normal society connected with you, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  connected with Europe, connected with Asia. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=588.68s)]
*  And the US said, we get it, we get it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=591.2399999999999s)]
*  We won, you do everything we say [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=593.0s)]
*  and we determine how the pieces are gonna go. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=595.32s)]
*  So in the early 2000s, Putin comes in. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=597.6s)]
*  First business for Putin was good cooperation with Europe. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=602.6800000000001s)]
*  You go back to the early 2000s. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=608.24s)]
*  Again, I know the people. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  I watched closely. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=612.48s)]
*  I was a participant in some of it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=613.6s)]
*  Putin was completely pro-Europe. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=616.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=618.1600000000001s)]
*  And pro-US by the way. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=619.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=620.7600000000001s)]
*  And we don't wanna talk about this. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=621.7600000000001s)]
*  We don't wanna admit it [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=624.24s)]
*  because we don't want anything other than unprovoked. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=625.84s)]
*  So everything is phony what we say. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=629.28s)]
*  Everything is a lie. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=631.88s)]
*  But just to say, the US kept doing unilateral things [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=633.2s)]
*  that were really outrageous. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=639.96s)]
*  In 1999, we bombed Belgrade for 78 days. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=642.32s)]
*  Bad move. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=647.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=649.04s)]
*  We bombed a capital of Europe for 78 days. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=649.92s)]
*  What was, looking back, what was the point of that? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  The point of that was to break Serbia [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=657.56s)]
*  into create a new state, Kosovo, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=659.92s)]
*  where we have the largest NATO military base [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  in Southeast Europe. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=669.0s)]
*  We put bond steel base there [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=670.76s)]
*  because we wanted a base in Southeastern Europe. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=673.36s)]
*  And again, you look at the neocons. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=676.64s)]
*  It's nice of them. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=679.28s)]
*  They actually describe all of this in various documents. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  You have to make the links. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=683.72s)]
*  But in a document called [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=685.24s)]
*  Rebuilding America's Defenses in the year 2000, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=688.56s)]
*  they say the Balkans is a new strategic area for the US. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=692.36s)]
*  So we have to move large troops to the Balkans [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=696.72s)]
*  because their idea is literally the game of risk. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=700.72s)]
*  Not just you need good relations or peace. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=703.8399999999999s)]
*  We need our pieces on the board. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=706.64s)]
*  We need military bases with the advanced positioning [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=708.88s)]
*  of our military everywhere in the world. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=714.52s)]
*  So they wanted a big base in Southeastern Europe. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=716.76s)]
*  They didn't like Serbia. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=720.36s)]
*  Serbia was close to Russia. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  Anyway, we're the sole superpower. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=723.04s)]
*  We do what we want. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=725.52s)]
*  So they divided the country, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=727.08s)]
*  which they now claim you never do. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=730.28s)]
*  You never change borders. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=733.36s)]
*  We broke apart Serbia, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  established by our declaration a new country, Kosovo. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=736.84s)]
*  We put a huge NATO base there and that was the goal. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=740.68s)]
*  So that was 1999. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=743.9599999999999s)]
*  So it wasn't to save the oppressed Muslim population? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=744.8s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=747.56s)]
*  It wasn't to save the oppressed Muslim population? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=748.4s)]
*  It was very much to save the military industrial complex [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=750.72s)]
*  to have a nice location in Southeastern Europe. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=756.1999999999999s)]
*  It killed all those people, wrecked the city. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, it was a little bit sad, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=761.0s)]
*  but we do lots of sad things and lots of destructive things. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=764.52s)]
*  Lots of wars. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  We're the country of perpetual war. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=769.28s)]
*  We don't look back. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  We're not even supposed to talk about this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=772.4s)]
*  because this was unprovoked, remember? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=774.24s)]
*  So in 2002, the US unilaterally pulled out [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=776.48s)]
*  of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, unilaterally. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=779.8s)]
*  Well, that was one of the stabilizers [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=783.24s)]
*  of the relationship with Russia [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=785.72s)]
*  was one of the stabilizers of the global nuclear situation, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=787.48s)]
*  which is absolutely dangerous. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=793.24s)]
*  And the US unilaterally started putting Aegis missiles [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=795.2s)]
*  into first Poland, then Romania, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=799.8800000000001s)]
*  and the Russians are saying, wait a minute, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=802.6s)]
*  what do we know you're putting in this? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=805.32s)]
*  You're a few minutes from Moscow. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=806.7600000000001s)]
*  This is completely destabilizing. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=808.84s)]
*  Do you think you might wanna talk to us? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  So then comes 2004, seven more countries in NATO, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=813.08s)]
*  Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=817.84s)]
*  Slovakia and Slovenia. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=821.8000000000001s)]
*  Now starting filling in the Black Sea, Romania and Bulgaria, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=823.5200000000001s)]
*  suddenly they're now North Atlantic countries, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=828.1600000000001s)]
*  but it's all part of this design. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=830.9200000000001s)]
*  All spelled out, all quite explicit, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=833.32s)]
*  were surrounding Russia. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=835.8000000000001s)]
*  In 2007, President Putin gave a very clear speech [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=838.24s)]
*  at the Munich Security Conference, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=844.0s)]
*  very powerful, very correct, very frustrated, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=847.04s)]
*  where he said, gentlemen, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  you told us in 1990, NATO would never enlarge. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=856.76s)]
*  That was the promise made to President Gorbachev, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=860.36s)]
*  and it was the promise made to President Yeltsin. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=863.8s)]
*  And you cheated, and you repeatedly cheated, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=867.08s)]
*  and you don't even admit that you said this, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=870.6800000000001s)]
*  but it's all plainly documented by the way, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=873.12s)]
*  and as you know, in a thousand archival sites, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=876.24s)]
*  so it's easy to verify all of this. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=879.6800000000001s)]
*  James Baker III, our Secretary of State, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=882.72s)]
*  said that NATO would not move one inch eastward. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't a flippant statement, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=889.0s)]
*  it was a statement repeated and repeated and repeated. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=891.2s)]
*  Hans Dietrich Genscher, the Foreign Minister of Germany, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=895.8000000000001s)]
*  same story, the Germans wanted reunification, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=900.36s)]
*  Gorbachev said, we'll support that, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=903.76s)]
*  but we don't want that to come at our expense. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=906.76s)]
*  No, no, it won't come at your expense, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=910.9200000000001s)]
*  NATO won't move one inch eastward, Mr. President. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=913.0s)]
*  Repeated so many times in many documents, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=917.72s)]
*  many statements by the NATO Secretary General, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=921.24s)]
*  by the US Secretary of State, by the German Chancellor, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=923.92s)]
*  now of course, all denied by our foreign policy blob, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=928.4399999999999s)]
*  because we're not supposed to remember anything, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  remember this was all unprovoked. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=935.56s)]
*  So back to 2007, Putin gives this speech, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=937.56s)]
*  and he says, stop, don't even think about Ukraine. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=941.16s)]
*  This is our 2,100 kilometer border. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=947.24s)]
*  This is absolutely part of the integrated economy [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=951.8s)]
*  of this region, don't even think about it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  Now I know from insiders, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=960.4s)]
*  from all the diplomatic work that I do, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=962.56s)]
*  that Europe was saying to the US European leaders, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=965.4s)]
*  don't think about Ukraine, please, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=970.8399999999999s)]
*  this is not a good idea, just stop. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=973.4s)]
*  We know from our current CIA director, Bill Burns, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=976.88s)]
*  that he wrote a very eloquent, impassioned, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=983.0s)]
*  articulate, clear, secret as usual memo, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=989.28s)]
*  which we only got to see because WikiLeaks [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=994.6s)]
*  showed to the American people what maybe we would like [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=998.08s)]
*  to know once in a while, but we're never told. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1000.92s)]
*  What our government's doing. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1003.04s)]
*  What they're doing and how they're putting us [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1003.96s)]
*  at nuclear risk and other things. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1005.76s)]
*  Okay, this one did get out, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1007.72s)]
*  and it's called, niet means niet, no means no. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1010.12s)]
*  And what Bill Burns very perceptively, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1014.28s)]
*  articulately conveys to Condoleezza Rice [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1017.88s)]
*  and back to the White House in 2008 is, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1020.72s)]
*  Ukraine is really a red line, don't do it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1024.92s)]
*  It's not just Putin, it's not just Putin's government, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1029.24s)]
*  it's the entire political class of Russia. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1033.12s)]
*  And just to help all of us as we think about it, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1036.6799999999998s)]
*  it is exactly as if Mexico said, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1041.0s)]
*  we think it would be great to have Chinese military bases [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1046.32s)]
*  on the Rio Grande, we can't see why the US [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1049.36s)]
*  would have any problem with that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1051.96s)]
*  Of course, we would go completely insane, but we- [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1054.0s)]
*  And we should. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1057.84s)]
*  And we should, of course, the whole idea is [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1058.6799999999998s)]
*  so absurdly dangerous and reckless [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1061.28s)]
*  that you can't even imagine grownups doing this. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1066.12s)]
*  So what happens is, for what I'm told by European leaders [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1070.52s)]
*  and by long detailed discussion, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1076.76s)]
*  Bush Jr. says to them, no, no, no, no, it's okay. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1081.32s)]
*  Don't worry, I hear you about Ukraine. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1085.08s)]
*  And then he goes off for the Christmas holidays [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1090.1599999999999s)]
*  and comes back, whether it's Cheney, whether it's Bush, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1093.76s)]
*  whatever it is, says, yeah, NATO's gonna enlarge to Ukraine. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1097.3999999999999s)]
*  And the Europeans are shocked, pissed. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1102.8799999999999s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1106.8s)]
*  You may have come to the obvious conclusion [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1108.04s)]
*  that the real debate is not between Republican and Democrat [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1109.6s)]
*  or socialist and capitalist, right and left. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1112.72s)]
*  The real battle is between people who are lying on purpose [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1117.24s)]
*  and people who are trying to tell you the truth. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1120.48s)]
*  It's between good and evil. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1123.32s)]
*  It's between honesty and falsehood. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1124.82s)]
*  And we hope we are on the former side. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1127.68s)]
*  That's why we created this network, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1130.48s)]
*  the Tucker Carlson Network, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1131.6s)]

*  A lot of behind the scenes footage [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1139.0s)]
*  of what actually happens in this barn [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1140.4s)]

*  You will not regret it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1148.92s)]
*  So Bush did not make that decision. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1150.48s)]
*  Bush did not make the decision? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1154.64s)]
*  Right, I mean, it sounds, if I'm hearing what you're saying. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1156.28s)]
*  Oh, what I'm saying? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1159.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1159.92s)]
*  No, Bush did make the decision. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1160.74s)]
*  Okay, but you. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1161.58s)]
*  No, what I'm saying is he had told the Europeans, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1162.42s)]
*  I hear you, I'm not gonna do it. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1164.8s)]
*  But it sounds like he was influenced [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1166.24s)]
*  by the people around him to change his mind. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1169.0s)]
*  Oh, no, that could be. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1170.0s)]
*  I don't know whether it was CIA [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1171.2s)]
*  or whether someone explained to him [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1173.6s)]
*  or whether someone said, George, Mr. President, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1175.12s)]
*  this is a longstanding project. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1178.92s)]
*  It's not something for a European country to object to. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1181.2s)]
*  I don't know what happened there. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1184.72s)]
*  But what I do know is that he came back [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1186.28s)]
*  and told the European leaders, no, we're doing it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1188.8s)]
*  They said, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not doing it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1191.8799999999999s)]
*  And then they had the NATO summit in Bucharest. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1194.44s)]
*  And this was 2008. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1197.6399999999999s)]
*  And the Europeans, Chancellor Merkel, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1200.24s)]
*  French president, all of them, George, don't do this. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1205.0s)]
*  Don't do this. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1209.6s)]
*  This is extraordinarily dangerous. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1210.42s)]
*  This is really provocative. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1211.96s)]
*  We don't really need or want NATO [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1213.32s)]
*  right up to the Russian border. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1216.32s)]
*  Bush pushed, pushed, pushed. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1219.24s)]
*  This is a US alliance fundamentally. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1221.88s)]
*  And they made the commitment, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1225.1200000000001s)]
*  Ukraine will become a member of NATO. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1227.16s)]
*  The dodge was, okay, we won't give them [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1230.24s)]
*  exactly the roadmap right now, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1232.24s)]
*  but Ukraine will become a member of NATO. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1234.3600000000001s)]
*  Because in those days, the US and Russia [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1238.44s)]
*  met in a NATO partnership. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1242.3200000000002s)]
*  Even then, Putin was there the next day in Bucharest [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1244.64s)]
*  saying, don't do this. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1248.96s)]
*  This is completely reckless. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1251.66s)]
*  Essentially, this is our fundamental red line. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1255.0s)]
*  Do not do this. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1258.8s)]
*  The US can't hear any of this. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1260.76s)]
*  This is our biggest problem of all, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1263.76s)]
*  because the neocons who have run the show for 30 years [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1266.36s)]
*  believe the US can do whatever it wants. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1271.44s)]
*  This is the most fundamental point [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1274.68s)]
*  to understand about US foreign policy. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1276.56s)]
*  They're wrong. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1278.88s)]
*  They keep screwing up. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1279.8s)]
*  They keep getting us into trillion dollar plus wars. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1281.04s)]
*  They keep killing a lot of people. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1283.76s)]
*  But their basic belief is the US is the only superpower. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1286.04s)]
*  It's the unipolar power and we can do what we want. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1290.8s)]
*  So they could not hear Putin even that moment. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1293.72s)]
*  They couldn't hear the rest of the Europeans. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1296.28s)]
*  And by the way, they said Georgia would become part of NATO. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1298.68s)]
*  Again, the only way to understand that [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1302.84s)]
*  is in this long standing Palmerstein-Brzynski theory. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1305.44s)]
*  This isn't just haphazard. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1310.72s)]
*  Oh, why don't we take Georgia? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1312.72s)]
*  This is a plan. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1314.2s)]
*  Okay, the Russians understand every single step of this. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1315.24s)]
*  So another thing goes awry. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1318.96s)]
*  What goes awry? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1322.3600000000001s)]
*  The Ukrainians don't want NATO enlargement. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1324.24s)]
*  The Ukrainians don't want it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1326.76s)]
*  They're against it. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1328.6000000000001s)]
*  The public opinion said, no, this is very dangerous. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1329.48s)]
*  Neutrality, it's safer. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1332.0s)]
*  We're in between East and West. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1333.24s)]
*  We don't want this. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1334.68s)]
*  So they elect Viktor Yanukovych, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1335.92s)]
*  the president that says, we'll just be neutral. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1338.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's absolutely the US's, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1343.6399999999999s)]
*  oh, what the hell is this? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1348.36s)]
*  Ukraine, they don't have any choice either. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1350.68s)]
*  So Yanukovych becomes the enemy of the neocons obviously. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1353.24s)]
*  So they start working. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1358.12s)]
*  Of course, the way that the US does, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1360.0s)]
*  we gotta get rid of this guy. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1362.56s)]
*  Maybe we'll elect his opponent afterwards. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1364.56s)]
*  Maybe we'll catch him in a crisis and so forth. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1367.36s)]
*  And indeed, at the end of 2013, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1371.0s)]
*  the US absolutely stokes a crisis [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1373.6799999999998s)]
*  that becomes an insurrection and then becomes a coup. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1377.7199999999998s)]
*  And I know again, from firsthand experience, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1381.1999999999998s)]
*  the US was profoundly implicated in that, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1383.9599999999998s)]
*  but you can see our senators standing up in the crowd. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1387.6s)]
*  Like if Chinese officials came to January 6th [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1390.4399999999998s)]
*  and said, yes, yes, go. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1394.3999999999999s)]
*  How would we like it if Chinese leaders came and said, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  yeah, we were with you 100%. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1400.8s)]
*  American senators standing up in Kiev [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1403.7199999999998s)]
*  saying to the demonstrators, we're with you 100%. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1409.08s)]
*  Victoria Nuland famously passing around the cookies, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1413.04s)]
*  but it was much, much more than the cookies, I can tell you. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1416.1999999999998s)]
*  And so the US conspired with a Ukrainian right [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1419.48s)]
*  to overthrow Yanukovych. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1425.3600000000001s)]
*  And there was a violent overthrow [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1427.08s)]
*  in the third week of February of 2014. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1429.24s)]
*  That's when this war started. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1433.6s)]
*  This war didn't even start in 2022, it started in 2014. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1435.88s)]
*  That was the outbreak of the war, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1440.28s)]
*  was a violent coup that overthrew a Ukrainian president [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1441.76s)]
*  that wanted neutrality. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1446.44s)]
*  When he was violently overthrown [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1448.44s)]
*  and his security people told him, you're gonna get killed. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1450.64s)]
*  And so he flew to Kharkiv and then flew onward to Russia [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1454.36s)]
*  that day, the US immediately in a nanosecond [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1459.6s)]
*  recognized the new government. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1463.0s)]
*  This is a coup, this is how the CIA [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1464.9199999999998s)]
*  does its regime change operations. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1466.8s)]
*  So this is when the war starts. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1469.32s)]
*  Putin's understanding completely correct in this moment [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1473.4399999999998s)]
*  was I'm not letting NATO take my naval fleet [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1478.4799999999998s)]
*  and my naval base in Crimea. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1484.6s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1487.6799999999998s)]
*  The Russian naval base in the Black Sea, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1489.32s)]
*  which was the object of the Crimean war [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1492.3999999999999s)]
*  and in its way is the object of this war in Sevastopol [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1495.36s)]
*  has been there since 1783. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1500.4799999999998s)]
*  And now Putin's saying, oh, NATO's gonna walk in? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1503.6799999999998s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1508.1999999999998s)]
*  And so they organize this referendum of the, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1509.4399999999998s)]
*  this is a Russian region [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1512.68s)]
*  and there's an overwhelming support. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1514.44s)]
*  We'll stay with Russia, thank you. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1516.2s)]
*  Not with this new post-coup government. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1517.5600000000002s)]
*  An outbreak breaks out in the Eastern provinces, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1520.64s)]
*  which are the ethnic Russian provinces in the Donbas, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1525.0s)]
*  in the Donbas and Lugansk and Donetsk. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1528.88s)]
*  And there's a lot of violence. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1532.3200000000002s)]
*  So the war starts in 2014. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1535.2800000000002s)]
*  So saying something's unprovoked in 2022 [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1537.2800000000002s)]
*  is a little bizarre for anyone [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1540.24s)]
*  that actually reads a normal newspaper to begin with. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1541.8799999999999s)]
*  But in any event, the war starts then. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1544.96s)]
*  And within a year, the Russians are saying very wisely, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1547.52s)]
*  we actually don't want this war. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1553.24s)]
*  We don't wanna own Ukraine. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1555.96s)]
*  We don't want problems on our border. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1558.12s)]
*  We would like peace based on respect [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1561.04s)]
*  for the ethnic Russians in the East [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1566.04s)]
*  and political autonomy because you, the coup government [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1570.3600000000001s)]
*  tried to close down all Russian language, culture [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1575.4s)]
*  and rights of these people after having made a violent coup. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1579.76s)]
*  So we don't accept that. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1584.48s)]
*  So what came out of that was two agreements [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1586.04s)]
*  called the Minsk 1 and the Minsk 2 agreement. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1588.76s)]
*  The Minsk 2 agreement was backed by the UN Security Council. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1592.16s)]
*  And it said that we'll make peace based on autonomy [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1596.0s)]
*  of the Donbas region. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1601.48s)]
*  Now, very interesting. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1604.36s)]
*  The Russians were not saying that's ours. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1605.56s)]
*  We want that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1607.84s)]
*  All the things that are claimed every day [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1608.8s)]
*  that Putin just wants to recreate. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1611.96s)]
*  He thinks he's Peter the Great. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1614.56s)]
*  He wants to recreate the Russian empire. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1615.8s)]
*  He wants to grab territory. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1617.76s)]
*  Nothing like that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1619.28s)]
*  The opposite. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1620.72s)]
*  We don't want the territory. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1621.88s)]
*  We actually just want autonomy based on an agreement [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1623.36s)]
*  reached with the Ukrainian government. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1628.1599999999999s)]
*  So what was the US attitude towards that? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1630.1999999999998s)]
*  US government attitude. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1632.6s)]
*  US government attitude was to say to the Ukrainians, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1634.12s)]
*  don't worry about it. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1637.52s)]
*  Come on, don't worry about it. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1639.32s)]
*  You keep your central state. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1641.08s)]
*  We don't want to see Ukraine weakened at all. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1642.6s)]
*  We just want a NATO in a unified Ukraine. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1644.84s)]
*  Don't go for decentralization. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1648.1999999999998s)]
*  We tell them to blow off the very treaty that they've signed. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1650.44s)]
*  Then we accuse Russia of not having diplomacy, by the way, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1655.0s)]
*  which is par for the course. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1658.68s)]
*  Oh, you can't trust them. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1660.1200000000001s)]
*  We blow off every single agreement. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1661.28s)]
*  We blow off not moving one inch eastward. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1663.88s)]
*  We blow off the anti-ballistic missile treaty. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1667.28s)]
*  We have so many NATO-led wars of choice in between. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1670.24s)]
*  I didn't even mention in Syria, CIA attempt to overthrow Assad, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1675.76s)]
*  in Libya, and so forth. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1680.76s)]
*  And we blow off the Minsk agreements. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1682.76s)]
*  And actually, Angela Merkel explained in a rather shockingly [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1685.88s)]
*  frank interview that she gave last year, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1690.92s)]
*  when asked why Germany didn't help to enforce the Minsk [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1694.8s)]
*  agreement, because Germany and France were the guarantors [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1699.2s)]
*  of the Minsk agreement under something called the Normandy [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1704.92s)]
*  process, she said, well, we just thought [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1707.76s)]
*  this was to give some time to the Ukrainians [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1712.64s)]
*  to build up their strength. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1715.28s)]
*  In other words, they were guarantors of something [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1716.8400000000001s)]
*  in a phony way. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1719.3200000000002s)]
*  And the US was absolutely lying about this. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1720.6000000000001s)]
*  And I know senior Ukrainians who were in government [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1726.48s)]
*  and who were around the government who said to me, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1730.6000000000001s)]
*  Jeff, we're not going to do that. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1732.84s)]
*  Anyway, that was at gunpoint. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1735.36s)]
*  We don't have to agree with that. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1737.24s)]
*  So all that diplomacy was blown off. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1739.0s)]
*  The war continued. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1742.52s)]
*  The US pumped in arms, built up armaments, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1744.84s)]
*  was building up what would be the biggest army of Europe, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1748.52s)]
*  actually, a huge army that Russia was watching. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1751.72s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1756.8s)]
*  You're not honoring Minsk. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1758.1599999999999s)]
*  You're building up this huge Ukrainian army. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1759.56s)]
*  Paid for by NATO. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1763.6799999999998s)]
*  Paid for by the United States, basically, yes. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1765.0s)]
*  And in 2021, Putin met with Biden. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1767.84s)]
*  And then after the meeting, he put on the table [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1773.6399999999999s)]
*  a draft Russia-US security agreement. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1777.52s)]
*  Put it on the table on December 15, 2021. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1782.08s)]
*  It's worth reading. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1785.56s)]
*  Very plausible document. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1786.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't agree with some of it. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1789.08s)]
*  It's a negotiable document, something you would negotiate. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1790.52s)]
*  I thought the core of it was stop the NATO enlargement. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1795.96s)]
*  And I called the White House myself at that point [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1800.76s)]
*  and said, don't have a war over this. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1804.6799999999998s)]
*  Who did you talk to? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1810.4399999999998s)]
*  I talked to Jake Sullivan. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1811.32s)]
*  And I said, don't have a war over this. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1812.6s)]
*  We don't need NATO enlargement for US security. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1816.1599999999999s)]
*  In fact, it's counter to US security. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1819.04s)]
*  The US should not be right up against the Russian border. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1821.32s)]
*  That's how we trip ourselves into World War III. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1825.44s)]
*  No, Jeff, don't worry. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1829.24s)]
*  No war. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1830.92s)]
*  There's not going to be a war. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1831.8s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1833.28s)]
*  We've got a diplomatic approach. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1834.44s)]
*  I said, Jake, this is a basis for diplomacy. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1836.04s)]
*  Negotiate. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1839.36s)]
*  Well, the formal response of the United States [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1842.24s)]
*  is that issues about NATO are non-negotiable. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1846.36s)]
*  They're only between NATO countries and NATO candidates. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1850.84s)]
*  No third party has any stake or interest or say in this. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1855.08s)]
*  Russia, it's completely irrelevant. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1860.8799999999999s)]
*  Again, to use the analogy, if Mexico and China [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1863.7199999999998s)]
*  want to put Chinese military bases on the Rio Grande, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1867.36s)]
*  the United States has no right to interfere in that. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1871.1999999999998s)]
*  And no interest in it. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1873.9199999999998s)]
*  No interest in it. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1874.76s)]
*  And no bilateral. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1875.76s)]
*  And this was the formal US response in January 2022. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1876.8799999999999s)]
*  So unprovoked, not exactly. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1884.8s)]
*  So can I ask? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1887.84s)]
*  30 years of provocation where we could not [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1888.36s)]
*  take peace for an answer one moment. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1892.2s)]
*  All we could take is we'll do whatever we want, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1896.44s)]
*  wherever we want. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1900.36s)]
*  And no one has any say in this at all. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1901.8s)]
*  So can I just go back 12, I guess, 22 years? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1906.3999999999999s)]
*  Putin told me, and I checked, I think it's true, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1911.52s)]
*  that he, in Clinton's final days, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1913.52s)]
*  asked Clinton if Russia could join NATO, which seems almost [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1916.04s)]
*  by definition like a victory. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1920.2s)]
*  NATO exists as a bulwark against Russia. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1922.08s)]
*  Russia wants to join the alliance. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1923.8799999999999s)]
*  Then you've won, right? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1925.28s)]
*  Why would the US government have turned that offer down? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1926.72s)]
*  And do you think that is real? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1931.56s)]
*  Russia, and actually Europe, wanted, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1934.48s)]
*  used to want before Europe was completely a kind of vassal [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1939.3999999999999s)]
*  province of the United States government, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1942.6399999999999s)]
*  wanted what they call collective security, which was we want [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  security arrangements in which one country's security doesn't [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1949.96s)]
*  ruin the security of another country. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1954.32s)]
*  And there were two paths to that. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1957.36s)]
*  Basically, three paths, let's say. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1960.0s)]
*  One path was what they call the OSCE, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1961.8400000000001s)]
*  the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1964.24s)]
*  Really a good idea. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1967.68s)]
*  It's Western Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1970.0400000000002s)]
*  and former Soviet Union. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1972.8000000000002s)]
*  And the idea was, let's bring us all together [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1974.68s)]
*  under one kind of charter, and we'll work out a collective [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1976.88s)]
*  security arrangement. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1980.16s)]
*  I like that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1981.76s)]
*  This is what Gorbachev was saying. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1982.96s)]
*  We don't want war with you. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1985.2s)]
*  We don't want conflict with you. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1986.68s)]
*  We want collective security. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1988.08s)]
*  Second arrangement that actually makes a lot of sense, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1990.12s)]
*  but people say, is this guy out of his mind? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1993.8799999999999s)]
*  But it actually makes a lot of sense. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1995.8799999999999s)]
*  Gorbachev disbanded the Warsaw Pact. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=1998.32s)]
*  We should have disbanded NATO. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2002.96s)]
*  NATO was there to defend against a Soviet invasion. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2005.6s)]
*  There's not going to be any Soviet invasion. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2009.08s)]
*  In fact, after December 1991, there's not even [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2011.3999999999999s)]
*  a Soviet Union. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2014.8799999999999s)]
*  We don't need NATO. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2016.1599999999999s)]
*  Why is there NATO? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2018.04s)]
*  NATO was established to defend against the Soviet Union. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2020.56s)]
*  So why did it continue after Gorbachev and Yeltsin? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2024.44s)]
*  The neocons, thankfully, thank you, read the document. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2029.12s)]
*  It's all explicit. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2033.04s)]
*  This is our way of keeping our hegemony in Europe. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2034.24s)]
*  In other words, this is our way of keeping our say in Europe, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2038.52s)]
*  not protecting Europe, not even protecting us. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2042.8s)]
*  This is hegemony. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2046.3999999999999s)]
*  We need our pieces on the board. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2047.32s)]
*  NATO's our pieces on the board. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2049.24s)]
*  Why would Germany allow foreign troops garrison [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2051.2799999999997s)]
*  on its soil for 80 years? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2055.84s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2056.88s)]
*  Why would European countries allow that? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2057.7599999999998s)]
*  Would you want foreign troops in your town? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2060.56s)]
*  Tucker, when you had your wonderful interview [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2063.24s)]
*  with Putin, he answered everything [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2068.4s)]
*  except once you asked him, what are the Germans seeing in this? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2071.92s)]
*  And Putin said, I don't get it. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2077.2s)]
*  And I thought, oh my god, thank you. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2080.52s)]
*  I don't get it either. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2085.24s)]
*  If it is broken by war guilt, is it masochism? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2086.48s)]
*  I mean, honestly, it's not masochism. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2089.0s)]
*  It's not war guilt. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2090.96s)]
*  There are basic mechanisms that I don't understand truly [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2093.68s)]
*  after being around more than 40 years in this [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2098.3999999999996s)]
*  and knowing all the leaders, and I know Schultz, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2101.2s)]
*  and I know others. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2104.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2106.04s)]
*  But when the US has a military base in your country, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2107.04s)]
*  it really pulls a lot of the political strings [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2111.24s)]
*  in your country. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2114.28s)]
*  It really influences the political parties. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2115.24s)]
*  It really pays. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2117.8s)]
*  I know it's naive. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2118.92s)]
*  In other words, the Germans are not free actors in this. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2121.72s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2125.72s)]
*  If men with guns showed up in your apartment in New York [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2126.48s)]
*  and just camped out there, you probably [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2129.8s)]
*  wouldn't really be the head of your household anymore, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2131.52s)]
*  would you? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2133.12s)]
*  It's probably true. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2134.88s)]
*  But your question of why would the Germans want this, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2136.04s)]
*  it's the same question of after the US blew up the Nord Stream [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2142.72s)]
*  pipeline, why wouldn't the Germans have said before [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2146.88s)]
*  or after, why did you do that? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2151.52s)]
*  This is our economy. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2153.8s)]
*  You just blew up. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2155.0s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2156.24s)]
*  And so they're so subservient to the US interests. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2157.56s)]
*  It's a little hard to understand because it [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2163.48s)]
*  makes no sense for Europe. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2165.4s)]
*  But like you said, there are armed people in your house. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2167.04s)]
*  Maybe that's the bottom line. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2169.8s)]
*  I've spoken to European leaders who have said to me, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2172.04s)]
*  I can't quote it because it's so shocking. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2176.2400000000002s)]
*  And I won't quote it because it was said confidentially. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2179.56s)]
*  But basically, they don't take us seriously in Washington. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2182.52s)]
*  And I said, yes. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2187.8s)]
*  I didn't say it was the bubble over my head [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2190.12s)]
*  speaking to a European leader. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2192.52s)]
*  But maybe if you pushed a little bit, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2194.16s)]
*  you would be taken more seriously, not [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2197.68s)]
*  in this way of just defeat. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2199.96s)]
*  But it was said to me in such a sad way, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2203.2s)]
*  I just felt, oh, god, don't tell me that. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2206.12s)]
*  You're a leader in Europe. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2208.92s)]
*  But we're occupying their country with soldiers and guns. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2210.68s)]
*  How could we take them seriously? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2213.2799999999997s)]
*  They're a bitch. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2214.64s)]
*  I mean, honestly. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2215.3599999999997s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2216.3599999999997s)]
*  It's really sad. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2217.16s)]
*  And it's doing a lot of damage to Europe. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2218.16s)]
*  It's destroying Ukraine, by the way. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2223.2s)]
*  That's the first point. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2224.8399999999997s)]
*  It's destroying Ukraine. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2226.3599999999997s)]
*  It's doing a lot of damage to Europe. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2227.4399999999996s)]
*  It's wasting a hell of a lot of lives and money [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2229.68s)]
*  in the United States, which the neocons don't count. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2236.12s)]
*  And almost nobody stands up and talks about it. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2241.3599999999997s)]
*  And your first question about being unprovoked, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2245.12s)]
*  we even have a story about it. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2248.64s)]
*  The story is complete bull. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2251.28s)]
*  It's complete nonsense. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2253.56s)]
*  It's for people who don't want or don't remember, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2255.08s)]
*  don't want to remember anything before February 24, 2022. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2259.6800000000003s)]
*  But there's a whole long history to this that's absolutely [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2265.64s)]
*  kind of absurd and tragic. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2269.52s)]
*  I mean, it's absurd. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2271.6800000000003s)]
*  It's utterly tragic. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2273.96s)]
*  500,000 Ukrainians dead for nothing. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2275.44s)]
*  Do you think that's the number? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2279.16s)]
*  I think that's probably the number, yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2280.92s)]
*  That's the best number that I know. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2282.72s)]
*  I mean, we talked about this last night at dinner. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2284.8799999999997s)]
*  But one of the most shocking things, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2286.7599999999998s)]
*  just as someone who lived in Washington, to me, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2288.2s)]
*  is if you ask any of the senators, as I have, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2290.8399999999997s)]
*  who voted to keep this war going with US tax dollars, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2295.16s)]
*  how many of your beloved Ukrainians have been killed, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2298.2s)]
*  they have no idea and they have no interest in knowing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2300.7599999999998s)]
*  And they don't care at all. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2302.3199999999997s)]
*  And sometimes they say they don't care. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2303.92s)]
*  Mitt Romney said, you know, it's greatest bargain, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2307.24s)]
*  no American lives. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2310.24s)]
*  Dick Blumenthal said the same thing, basically. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2312.2799999999997s)]
*  This is a great bargain, no American lives. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2314.7599999999998s)]
*  But isn't that evil? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2316.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, at some point, it's certainly hypocritical [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2318.0s)]
*  that you're telling us we're doing this for Ukraine, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2319.9199999999996s)]
*  for our friends in Ukraine, the standard bearers of democracy. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2322.52s)]
*  But also, don't you have an obligation to kind of care [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2326.12s)]
*  about the people you kill? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2328.2s)]
*  I think so. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2330.08s)]
*  You think so. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2331.3199999999997s)]
*  I think Americans think so. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2332.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't think that the security apparatus thinks so. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2335.3599999999997s)]
*  Because the security state, you know, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2338.8399999999997s)]
*  you've got to be tough to play that game of risk. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2340.7999999999997s)]
*  You've got to know there are going [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2343.16s)]
*  to be some collateral losses. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2344.72s)]
*  Millions of people have died in American wars of choice. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2347.4799999999996s)]
*  But if you're a big boy, you can't let that deter you. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2350.9199999999996s)]
*  So I think it's pretty deeply ingrained [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2354.68s)]
*  that a few hundred thousand lives here and there, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2358.7599999999998s)]
*  come on, we're talking about who runs the world after all. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2361.12s)]
*  That's really, really dark. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2363.92s)]
*  I think it's extraordinarily reckless. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2365.2000000000003s)]
*  Just to circle back, well, also, look, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2368.28s)]
*  if the pretext for all of this is some sort of moral authority, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2370.64s)]
*  we're for democracy, they're for authoritarianism. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2373.64s)]
*  This has nothing to do with morality. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2375.6800000000003s)]
*  This has nothing to do with morality. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2377.2000000000003s)]
*  It has nothing to do with Western values. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2379.56s)]
*  It has nothing to do with American values. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2381.76s)]
*  It doesn't even have to do with American interests [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2384.12s)]
*  from what I can see. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2386.4s)]
*  Although it says that they say that American interests are [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2387.32s)]
*  at stake. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2390.64s)]
*  Well, we've spent maybe $7 trillion [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2391.44s)]
*  on these reckless perpetual wars since 2001. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2393.7200000000003s)]
*  Is that really? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2398.48s)]
*  We've added to the debt. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2399.56s)]
*  The debt's gone from about 30% of national income [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2402.08s)]
*  to more than 100% of national income. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2406.36s)]
*  We've had these disastrous wars. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2408.96s)]
*  Is this America's interest? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2411.44s)]
*  No. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2413.12s)]
*  Maybe we could have actually rebuilt a bridge or a road [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2415.08s)]
*  along the way. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2418.7200000000003s)]
*  Or even destroyed our country. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2419.36s)]
*  Even had a mile of fast rail in our country or something. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2420.76s)]
*  But no, we had to spend trillions and trillions on wars. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2423.88s)]
*  So to my mind, it's all completely perverse. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2427.32s)]
*  But what I find amazing is that once in a while, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2431.48s)]
*  you have to look, but once in a while, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2435.6000000000004s)]
*  you'll actually find the truth expressed in such a vulgar way. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2438.2400000000002s)]
*  No, they don't count the Ukrainian lives. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2442.2000000000003s)]
*  They literally say no American lives. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2444.0800000000004s)]
*  We're not even so sure about that, by the way. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2446.7200000000003s)]
*  No, Americans have died. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2449.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a large number, but it's some. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2450.2s)]
*  But they don't tell us the truth about that either. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2453.2s)]
*  So just to circle back to the provocation, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2456.0s)]
*  I watched as a complete non-expert, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2459.9199999999996s)]
*  the administration send the vice president to the Munich [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2462.6s)]
*  Security Conference in February of 2022 [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2465.2s)]
*  when it was clear that things were getting really hot. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2468.2799999999997s)]
*  And watched Kamala Harris say to Zelensky, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2470.8399999999997s)]
*  on camera, we want you to join NATO, when everybody, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2473.2799999999997s)]
*  even me, a talk show host, knew that that [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2476.2s)]
*  was the red line for Putin. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2478.16s)]
*  So the only conclusion I could reach [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2480.8799999999997s)]
*  was they want him to move across the border into Ukraine. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2482.7599999999998s)]
*  They want a war. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2485.44s)]
*  What is your take? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2487.08s)]
*  Tucker, just to say, until this moment, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2487.92s)]
*  every senior official in the US or the secretary general [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2492.8799999999997s)]
*  of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, says Ukraine will join NATO. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2497.68s)]
*  And one thing everyone that's listening should understand, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2503.24s)]
*  Ukraine will never join NATO short of a nuclear war [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2507.0s)]
*  because Russia will never allow it, period. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2512.64s)]
*  So every time we say it, all we mean is the war continues [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2517.08s)]
*  and more Ukrainians are destroyed. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2522.4s)]
*  And we're willing to risk nuclear conflict. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2524.32s)]
*  And some people definitely are because they're idiots, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2526.16s)]
*  really, because that, my resentment, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2531.2s)]
*  gets very high when we reach that level. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2534.28s)]
*  But we here talk about nuclear war these days. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2537.52s)]
*  We hear we're not going to be blackmailed by this nuclear [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2541.28s)]
*  threat and so forth. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2544.8s)]
*  Well, god damn it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2546.1600000000003s)]
*  You'd better be worried. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2547.32s)]
*  We're talking about a counterpart [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2548.6800000000003s)]
*  that has 6,000 nuclear warheads. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2551.1200000000003s)]
*  We have 6,000 nuclear warheads. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2553.88s)]
*  We have a lot of crazy people in our government. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2556.84s)]
*  I know it. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2559.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm adult enough to know over 44 years of professional life [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2559.88s)]
*  that there are a lot of intemperate people [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2565.8s)]
*  in our country. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2568.32s)]
*  We have a lot of allies that say, oh, we can do this. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2569.44s)]
*  We have a president of Latvia tweeting or X-ing [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2572.92s)]
*  or whatever the verb is these days, Russia dilenda est. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2577.08s)]
*  In other words, Russia must be destroyed, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2581.84s)]
*  playing off of the old Cato the Elder, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2584.92s)]
*  Cartago dilenda est. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2589.44s)]
*  Carthage must be destroyed. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2590.96s)]
*  Honestly, a president of a Baltic state [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2593.84s)]
*  tweeting that Russia must be destroyed. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2598.88s)]
*  This is prudent. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2601.76s)]
*  This is safe. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2603.0s)]
*  This is going to keep your family and my family safe. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2603.88s)]
*  Are we out of our minds? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2607.48s)]
*  And all through this, Biden hasn't called Putin [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2610.2400000000002s)]
*  one time. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2614.04s)]
*  And I speak to very senior Russian officials. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2616.24s)]
*  You speak to the most senior Russian official. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2618.92s)]
*  They say, we want to negotiate. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2621.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course, we'll talk. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2624.68s)]
*  Zelensky quote unquote made it illegal. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2626.88s)]
*  And the United States says, well, we [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2630.2799999999997s)]
*  won't do anything that the Ukrainians don't want. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2632.68s)]
*  This is insane, by the way, as if this is really [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2635.2799999999997s)]
*  between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2638.96s)]
*  This is about the United States and Russia. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2640.6s)]
*  Everybody should understand. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2644.36s)]
*  This isn't even about Ukraine and Russia. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2646.0s)]
*  This is about the US being in Ukraine and Russia. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2648.6800000000003s)]
*  So the ones that need to talk are Biden and Putin, period. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2652.52s)]
*  And I keep saying, if I may say it again just now, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2657.2000000000003s)]
*  I keep saying to Biden, if you want to use my Zoom account, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2660.84s)]
*  please use it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2664.1600000000003s)]
*  I'll lend you my phone. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2665.1600000000003s)]
*  You make the call. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2666.52s)]
*  Start negotiations. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2667.76s)]
*  I don't like my family being at risk of nuclear war. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2669.68s)]
*  Why won't they? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2674.48s)]
*  Because they believed up until now, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2676.2s)]
*  I think they can't quite believe it now, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2681.04s)]
*  they believed up until now that they would get their way [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2684.48s)]
*  through bluff or superiority of force or superiority [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2689.08s)]
*  of finance. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2694.44s)]
*  They gambled because they were gambling [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2697.04s)]
*  with someone else's lives, someone else's country, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2700.6s)]
*  and someone else's money, our money, the taxpayer money. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2703.4s)]
*  But they were gambling, not with their own stakes. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2706.2799999999997s)]
*  But they were gambling. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2709.72s)]
*  They're not very clever. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2711.44s)]
*  They gambled wrong all along. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2713.0s)]
*  Putin said, no. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2716.0s)]
*  For us, this is existential. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2717.7599999999998s)]
*  For you, it's a game, apparently the game of risk. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2719.92s)]
*  You need your piece on that board, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2722.8s)]
*  if American NATO forces in Ukraine [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2724.7999999999997s)]
*  is somehow existential for the United States [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2728.8799999999997s)]
*  as opposed to a neutral Ukraine. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2731.48s)]
*  And they thought that they would get their way. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2733.68s)]
*  And I spoke with senior officials [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2735.72s)]
*  all along who just thought Russia won't object or can't [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2737.96s)]
*  object or will be pushed aside or will fall to its knees [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2744.24s)]
*  with US financial sanctions or will [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2750.08s)]
*  succumb to the US high mars and attackms. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2753.44s)]
*  Just one absolutely naive idea after another. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2758.2000000000003s)]
*  But you might ask me, how can they have such naive ideas? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2764.48s)]
*  Well, that was my question, yes. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2768.92s)]
*  And I'm sorry to put words in your mouth, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2770.48s)]
*  but I would say, well, I'm old enough to remember Vietnam. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2772.48s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember trying [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2775.84s)]
*  to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2777.92s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember Libya. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2781.16s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember Afghanistan. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2782.84s)]
*  We screw up nonstop. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2785.48s)]
*  This is not clever what we're doing. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2788.2400000000002s)]
*  But the people, what's so interesting, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2790.84s)]
*  so you've been an academic your whole life. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2792.44s)]
*  I think you're one of the youngest tenured professors [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2794.44s)]
*  at Harvard. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2796.7200000000003s)]
*  But you've also been, I think, uniquely a diplomat on and off, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2797.2400000000002s)]
*  mostly on for decades. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2802.1600000000003s)]
*  So you know the people who are making US foreign policy [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2804.56s)]
*  personally well. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2807.96s)]
*  And the quality of the person engaged in that [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2810.16s)]
*  seems to have declined just dramatically. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2812.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that's true, by the way. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2814.44s)]
*  I think it's true in general of American politics. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2815.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe it's an illusion, but when I was a kid in college, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2820.72s)]
*  I did my summer internships in my senator's office, Senator [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2825.7999999999997s)]
*  Phil Hart. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2831.8399999999997s)]
*  He was a man of great integrity, of great intelligence. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2833.08s)]
*  He was a Democrat, but he had lots of Republican friends [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2837.2s)]
*  and colleagues. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2840.56s)]
*  There were big people there. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2841.72s)]
*  And they were serious people, Fulbright and Frank Church. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2845.2s)]
*  And really wonderful, impressive people, Chuck Percy, Lugar. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2853.24s)]
*  Really impressive people who wanted the US to do right, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2859.6s)]
*  to do good. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2863.52s)]
*  And I admired them, and it was on both sides [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2864.84s)]
*  of Republican and Democrat. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2867.56s)]
*  And you feel it's not like that right now. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2870.04s)]
*  It's really not like that right now. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2873.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't see wise people on either side. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2876.6000000000004s)]
*  I hate to say that. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2878.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think it's a partisan divide. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2879.04s)]
*  They all seem crazy and dumb to me. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2880.6000000000004s)]
*  We chatted, Rand Paul's the only one for me [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2884.4s)]
*  that makes sense on foreign policy right now. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2888.2400000000002s)]
*  He says, stop this. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2890.28s)]
*  There's so many damn wars. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2891.6400000000003s)]
*  It's putting us at incredible risk. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2893.2s)]
*  But you don't hear the Democrats. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2896.2799999999997s)]
*  They line up 100% for more military spending, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2898.16s)]
*  continue the war. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2902.24s)]
*  We have people that completely shock me [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2903.56s)]
*  that are saying these stupid things about no US lives, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2906.4399999999996s)]
*  as if Ukrainian lives don't matter. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2911.16s)]
*  Nobody wants to talk about negotiation. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2914.7999999999997s)]
*  No one says anything on us. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2918.2799999999997s)]
*  No one calls. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2920.08s)]
*  No one even wants the truth out of the White House [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2923.2s)]
*  or the executive branch, which is another role of Congress, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2928.16s)]
*  which is, don't take us for a ride. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2932.04s)]
*  We're an independent, separate, equal part of government. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2934.24s)]
*  And it used to be that Congress kind of resented [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2939.12s)]
*  when the executive branch lied to it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2942.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2944.56s)]
*  You don't see that resentment. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2945.3199999999997s)]
*  They crave for lives. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2946.52s)]
*  You don't see that resentment. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2947.84s)]
*  You see partisanship. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2949.48s)]
*  If it's a Republican president, then the Democrats go after him. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2950.72s)]
*  If it's a Democratic president, Republicans. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2953.56s)]
*  But nobody from one's own party tells their president, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2955.88s)]
*  stop bullshitting us. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2960.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2961.76s)]
*  And that's very serious. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2962.68s)]
*  Well, and these are not small lies. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2964.12s)]
*  So the two of the biggest lies are [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2966.12s)]
*  that Ukraine can win, whatever that means, never defined, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2968.16s)]
*  push Russia back to its January 2022 border, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2971.76s)]
*  and two, that Ukraine will join NATO. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2975.44s)]
*  And neither one of those things is true. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2977.92s)]
*  They're not only not true. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2979.88s)]
*  If you are able to watch you or someone outside the mainstream, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2981.92s)]
*  it becomes obvious that these aren't true. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2989.2000000000003s)]
*  But if you follow Admiral Kirby and the White House every day, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2991.92s)]
*  he's a liar. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2997.0s)]
*  Lying with a smirk on his face, which [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2997.48s)]
*  I can't stand because he can't even control his smirk [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=2999.64s)]
*  because he tells us, I'm lying. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3002.92s)]
*  As he's talking, it's unreal. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3005.3199999999997s)]
*  But if you read The New York Times, which [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3008.56s)]
*  is sad and pathetic, you won't know. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3012.2s)]
*  But if you actually listen to any independent outlets, which [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3015.6s)]
*  I do because I'm traveling in the world most of the time, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3021.08s)]
*  actually, not in the US, you know [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3023.96s)]
*  that these things are obvious. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3027.7599999999998s)]
*  Someone asked me a couple of days ago, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3029.2799999999997s)]
*  Ukraine's getting blasted on the battlefield now. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3031.28s)]
*  Some days are 1,500 dead, typical 1,000 dead. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3035.8s)]
*  Russia has air superiority, artillery superiority, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3041.2400000000002s)]
*  missile superiority, everything. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3044.84s)]
*  And the Ukrainians are getting blasted. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3047.6400000000003s)]
*  And now the US press is reporting, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3051.5600000000004s)]
*  the Ukrainians are falling back. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3056.28s)]
*  And the tone has suddenly changed. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3059.48s)]
*  So someone asked me a couple of days ago, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3061.32s)]
*  why did this sudden change on the battlefield occur? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3063.48s)]
*  And I said, excuse me? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3067.2400000000002s)]
*  He said, yeah, why did this sudden change? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3068.76s)]
*  He said, there's no sudden change. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3070.56s)]
*  This whole trend has been obvious for more than two years. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3072.7200000000003s)]
*  We're in a war of attrition, and the bigger party [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3076.48s)]
*  is blasting the hell out of this. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3079.48s)]
*  Much bigger party. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3081.12s)]
*  Much bigger party. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3082.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3082.68s)]
*  But you wouldn't know it by any of our narrative, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3083.84s)]
*  official, congressional, or our kind of mainstream media, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3089.28s)]
*  because they don't tell the truth until, I'd say until, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3096.32s)]
*  but even after it's staring you in the face, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3100.6400000000003s)]
*  then maybe they'll say something that's a little bit true. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3105.1600000000003s)]
*  That just feels like North Korea to me, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3108.0s)]
*  or what you imagine North Korea is, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3109.6800000000003s)]
*  this news vacuum where everybody is [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3111.68s)]
*  under these huge misimpressions. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3115.2799999999997s)]
*  Nobody has any reference point in the truth at all. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3117.9199999999996s)]
*  People don't even know they're being lied to. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3121.3599999999997s)]
*  You travel constantly. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3123.6s)]
*  Is this the most sort of cut off country from an information [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3125.2799999999997s)]
*  perspective in the world? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3128.7999999999997s)]
*  I'll give an example. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3132.12s)]
*  When the US put on sanctions on Russia in March 2022, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3133.0s)]
*  just after the beginning of this latest phase of the war [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3140.16s)]
*  that started in 2014, I know senior US financial officials, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3146.16s)]
*  and they've, oh, we've got them. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3153.24s)]
*  This is going to crush them. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3154.72s)]
*  I said, I don't think so. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3155.8399999999997s)]
*  I was in Latin America last week. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3157.16s)]
*  They're not going to do this. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3159.7599999999998s)]
*  I was in India the week before that. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3161.24s)]
*  It's not going to go like that. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3163.52s)]
*  So what happened was the only ones that applied the sanctions [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3165.16s)]
*  are Europe, the United States, and a few allies in East Asia, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3168.76s)]
*  Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3174.2400000000002s)]
*  The rest of the world said, we're not part of that. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3178.1200000000003s)]
*  We don't sign up to this. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3182.0s)]
*  We don't like this. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3183.2400000000002s)]
*  We don't agree with the NATO enlargement. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3184.1600000000003s)]
*  We don't like this narrative. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3186.6400000000003s)]
*  And the sanctions proved to be pretty useless compared [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3188.4s)]
*  to what this grandiosity of the US strategists thought. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3195.68s)]
*  So it comes to this question, what does the rest of the world think? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3200.7999999999997s)]
*  The rest of the world doesn't think much of the United States, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3206.0s)]
*  what it's doing. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3208.7999999999997s)]
*  It seems to them, this is a bizarre country. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3209.56s)]
*  Why are you pushing NATO enlargement? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3213.3599999999997s)]
*  Why are you bringing us into your war? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3215.3199999999997s)]
*  We don't really want this. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3217.9199999999996s)]
*  Interestingly, most of the rest of the world [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3220.6s)]
*  is not against the United States, by the way. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3223.32s)]
*  They said, just don't make us choose all these things. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3226.4s)]
*  This isn't our battle. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3229.2000000000003s)]
*  And we don't even like what you're doing. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3230.7200000000003s)]
*  Just make peace, calm things down. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3232.44s)]
*  And we don't want bad relations. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3235.0s)]
*  So it's not as if the world's antagonistic. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3237.32s)]
*  But Washington does not get this at all. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3240.28s)]
*  I probably speak to more world leaders. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3244.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3247.8s)]
*  I speak to a lot of world leaders in developing countries all the time. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3248.6000000000004s)]
*  It's my job as a development economist. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3252.52s)]
*  So I'm talking to world leaders, foreign ministers, heads of state, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3255.2s)]
*  and so on. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3258.48s)]
*  And I know their understanding and position very clearly. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3260.04s)]
*  I don't know whether the White House or Blinken or anyone else [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3265.16s)]
*  in the administration understands even these basic points. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3271.6s)]
*  But it was obvious to me. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3275.28s)]
*  Do you know Blinken? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3276.96s)]
*  Obvious to me. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3277.68s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3278.68s)]
*  Not well. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3279.6s)]
*  From the outside, it seems like Blinken is a driving force. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3281.08s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3285.48s)]
*  Who do you think is? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3286.4s)]
*  I think there's a big, deep project of the security apparatus [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3288.44s)]
*  that goes back 30 years. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3293.72s)]
*  I think the CIA continues to be a driving force. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3295.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3300.92s)]
*  National Security Council is obviously a driving force. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3302.0s)]
*  The Pentagon is obviously a driving force. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3304.68s)]
*  The Armed Services Committee's. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3307.36s)]
*  It's not one individual, but it's a project that is long dated. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3309.2s)]
*  And it doesn't turn. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3315.6s)]
*  And we don't have a president that's very flexible of mind. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3317.4399999999996s)]
*  We don't have a president that is on top of any of this, it seems to me. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3320.68s)]
*  Not a nimble president, I'd say. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3324.72s)]
*  Not nimble, not effective, not necessarily in charge, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3326.52s)]
*  not necessarily making decisions. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3330.68s)]
*  I don't really know. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3332.2s)]
*  But what I do know is that it's not improv. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3333.48s)]
*  It's a rudder that's stuck, I would say. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3337.92s)]
*  In other words, they can't do something different. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3341.8s)]
*  And each what is improv is that the last thing they tried didn't work. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3345.84s)]
*  So now they need to quickly improvise something else as the rudder is stuck. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3352.16s)]
*  So we continue on the same destructive path. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3357.56s)]
*  And it's not working. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3362.64s)]
*  So, oh my god, we've got to do something else. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3363.92s)]
*  That's the improv part. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3367.48s)]
*  But what is not changing is goals, direction, strategy, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3369.36s)]
*  or this most basic point, which for me is kind of, it sounds so simple minded. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3375.52s)]
*  But I actually, from a lifetime of experience, really believe in it. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3382.36s)]
*  We don't talk to the other side. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3388.44s)]
*  We also seem to be huffing our own gas a bit, believing our own lies. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3391.12s)]
*  We believe that we need to lie. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3396.96s)]
*  Because maybe if your rudder's stuck and you're the skipper, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3400.08s)]
*  you have to say, full speed ahead. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3405.36s)]
*  In other words, if you can't move the rudder, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3408.2s)]
*  you have to give some self-justification for why [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3410.56s)]
*  we continue towards disaster. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3413.6s)]
*  So for example, since you are an economist, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3415.2s)]
*  the economic effects of kicking Russia to Swift, et cetera, et cetera, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3418.2s)]
*  of these very serious sanctions imposed against Russia two and a half years ago. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3422.6s)]
*  Big picture, it seems like. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3428.48s)]
*  That's a country with an economy based on natural resources [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3429.92s)]
*  and manufacturing. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3432.64s)]
*  Ours is largely an economy based on finance, lending money, interest, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3434.3199999999997s)]
*  and real estate. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3438.08s)]
*  Which is more durable? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3439.8399999999997s)]
*  Which is more real? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3441.24s)]
*  I mean, that's my perspective. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3442.96s)]
*  What's your sense of it? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3444.08s)]
*  Well, I think the basic point on the sanctions is if you have oil, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3445.04s)]
*  if you don't sell it to Europe, you can sell it to Asia. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3450.76s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3453.2000000000003s)]
*  And it wasn't so hard. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3454.1200000000003s)]
*  And they figured that out. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3455.4s)]
*  Even I know that, though. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3456.48s)]
*  They figured out how to get those tankers in. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3457.5600000000004s)]
*  They figured out how to get insurance cover. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3459.8s)]
*  And they figured out how to do it. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3461.8s)]
*  And they're making a lot of money. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3463.2400000000002s)]
*  And the sanctions didn't have any effect. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3464.32s)]
*  And what they also didn't understand, and I think it's also important for people [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3466.36s)]
*  to understand, in all of this neocon strategizing, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3472.28s)]
*  they had this glimmer of insight. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3477.52s)]
*  And actually, Big Brzezinski was very good on it. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3479.4s)]
*  He said, by all means, the one thing never, never to do [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3484.0s)]
*  is to drive Russia and China together. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3489.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3492.16s)]
*  And he said very explicitly. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3492.96s)]
*  And he says in 1997, in his book, The Grand Chessboard, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3494.64s)]
*  I think it's called, he says, but this is so unlikely. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3500.48s)]
*  This would be so crazy to do. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3506.0s)]
*  And this is exactly what these dunderheads have done. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3508.88s)]
*  Who are the neocons? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3512.4s)]
*  How would you describe them? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3513.48s)]
*  What is a neocon? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3514.56s)]
*  A neocon is a group of true believers starting [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3515.8s)]
*  that really rose to force in the last years of Bush senior. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3522.68s)]
*  It was Cheney, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3530.0s)]
*  But it became absolutely bipartisan. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3535.0s)]
*  Victoria Nuland is kind of the ultimate. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3537.88s)]
*  Her husband, Robert Kagan, is kind [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3541.08s)]
*  of the public intellectual of the neocons. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3545.84s)]
*  I mean, he is. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3548.56s)]
*  I know Bob well. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3550.2400000000002s)]
*  He's an idiot. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3551.28s)]
*  He's your public intellectual. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3552.96s)]
*  He's the guy that writes the tomes that say, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3554.84s)]
*  I think that this has been just about the most disastrous [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3558.48s)]
*  foreign policy imaginable. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3561.8s)]
*  How can you go from peace in 1991 [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3563.36s)]
*  when you have a chance for creating [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3569.08s)]
*  a peaceful, cooperative world that could actually [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3571.8s)]
*  be prosperous and do good things together to this mess [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3574.84s)]
*  that we're in? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3578.88s)]
*  It took a strategy so stupid, so reckless, so blind. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3579.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's what the neocons gave us. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3586.6400000000003s)]
*  They gave us a strategy which said, we now run the world. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3588.44s)]
*  And explicitly, we will be the world's policeman. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3592.96s)]
*  We will fight the wars that we need to fight whenever [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3595.64s)]
*  and wherever we need to fight them. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3598.68s)]
*  We will make sure that there's never a rival. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3600.12s)]
*  Well, you do that long enough, you [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3603.4s)]
*  end up in lots of absolutely destructive, stupid wars. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3605.56s)]
*  And the rest of the world doesn't just sit back and say, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3610.44s)]
*  oh, thank you, US. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3612.96s)]
*  We're so grateful you're the leader. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3614.28s)]
*  They say, come on. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3616.48s)]
*  You're 4.1% of the world population. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3618.92s)]
*  There's another 95.9% of the world population [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3621.68s)]
*  that actually would just like peace and some cooperation [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3625.8799999999997s)]
*  and not you to be telling us what to do. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3629.16s)]
*  So this strategy was explicit, clear, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3632.44s)]
*  adopted in the last years of basically in 1991, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3638.3199999999997s)]
*  1992, after the Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3645.72s)]
*  Clinton was just not serious, consequent, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3654.2799999999997s)]
*  or experienced enough. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3662.68s)]
*  He wasn't a rigid neocon, but Madeleine Albright [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3665.2s)]
*  was a true believer. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3670.0s)]
*  And Clinton drifted in that direction. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3671.96s)]
*  And that's also partly something to understand, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3676.92s)]
*  which is when you have the biggest military machine [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3679.68s)]
*  in the world, when you are so powerful, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3682.48s)]
*  the war machine is always revving. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3685.44s)]
*  There's always some case for war. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3688.52s)]
*  The neocons basically said, yeah, we're the policemen. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3690.88s)]
*  We're the constabulary. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3695.08s)]
*  This is our duty. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3696.92s)]
*  And said, you have to be in each of these conflicts, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3698.44s)]
*  because US reputation also depends on this. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3702.08s)]
*  So they invited regional wars everywhere and all the time [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3705.04s)]
*  and believed, of course, we could clean out governments [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3710.8s)]
*  we didn't want, regime change by war, by covert operations, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3713.6s)]
*  and so on. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3717.6s)]
*  And it became not a little movement. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3718.76s)]
*  It became the dominant drive. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3722.16s)]
*  So Clinton kind of drifted. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3725.48s)]
*  His administration was divided between Madeleine Albright [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3730.28s)]
*  and Holbrooke on one side and William Perry on the other side. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3733.8s)]
*  But he went with Albright. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3738.84s)]
*  By the end of Clinton's term was NATO enlargement, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3741.6s)]
*  bombing of Belgrade. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3746.68s)]
*  And we were kind of off to the races. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3749.08s)]
*  Then came Bush Jr., 9-11, global war on terror, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3751.16s)]
*  but basically 9-11 as the opportunity [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3758.6s)]
*  to implement the project for the new American century, which [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3763.7999999999997s)]
*  is the document that defines the neocon agenda. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3767.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's such an interesting document, because very clear. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3772.56s)]
*  It was very carefully studied. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3776.2s)]
*  And it's also important to understand the US is a big ship, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3778.6s)]
*  so it doesn't turn quick. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3782.88s)]
*  So you prepare a path, or it's this stuck rudder, as I said. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3784.2s)]
*  And you can read in Rebuilding America's Defenses, which [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3788.36s)]
*  was a kind of campaign document for the incoming Bush Jr. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3793.6s)]
*  administration what we should do. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3797.92s)]
*  And it defines this neocon agenda. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3800.12s)]
*  So Bush Jr. introduced all of these things, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3802.92s)]
*  the unilateral withdrawal from ABM, the war in Iraq, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3807.08s)]
*  the expansion of NATO to seven more countries, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3811.7599999999998s)]
*  the commitment to expand NATO to Ukraine and Georgia. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3814.7599999999998s)]
*  Then comes Obama. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3819.08s)]
*  You don't think of him as a neocon, especially, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3820.56s)]
*  but who becomes the point person for Eastern Europe and Ukraine, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3825.2s)]
*  Victoria Nuland. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3831.96s)]
*  So interesting. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3833.2s)]
*  Victoria Nuland was the deputy national security [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3834.8s)]
*  advisor of Cheney. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3837.6400000000003s)]
*  I remember very well. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3838.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3839.96s)]
*  So she was Cheney's advisor. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3840.48s)]
*  Then she was George W's ambassador to NATO [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3842.32s)]
*  during the commitment to enlargement. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3849.2400000000002s)]
*  And if Obama weren't a neocon, you would say, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3852.8s)]
*  well, that's not someone I'm going to hire. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3858.76s)]
*  But all of a sudden, she lands as Hillary's assistant. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3860.6s)]
*  Now Hillary's absolutely neocon to the core. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3866.88s)]
*  And there is Victoria Nuland. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3870.96s)]
*  And she goes from being Hillary's assistant [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3873.24s)]
*  to becoming assistant secretary of state for European affairs [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3875.7999999999997s)]
*  and becomes the point person in the overthrow of Yanukovych [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3880.8399999999997s)]
*  at the end of 2013 and early 2014. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3884.8399999999997s)]
*  And Obama is also very inexperienced. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3888.84s)]
*  Obviously, no experience at all in foreign policy. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3894.96s)]
*  But he wasn't by nature a neocon. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3897.2000000000003s)]
*  But the system keeps you moving unless you're [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3900.96s)]
*  a president that knows how to keep a foot on the brakes. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3905.4s)]
*  And we haven't had many presidents like that. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3908.28s)]
*  Eisenhower was one who knew how to put his foot on the brakes [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3911.32s)]
*  because he really understood this system. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3915.52s)]
*  John Kennedy learned it, but only after the Bay of Pigs [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3918.28s)]
*  and probably was killed by our government [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3921.6400000000003s)]
*  for trying to keep his foot on the brakes. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3926.7200000000003s)]
*  And there have not been many other occasions [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3930.2400000000002s)]
*  when presidents kept their foot on the brakes. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3933.6800000000003s)]
*  So in 2011, Obama does the absolute neocon [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3935.48s)]
*  play of saying, almost out of the blue, by the way, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3941.1600000000003s)]
*  why don't we overthrow Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3946.44s)]
*  Well, that's a little damn weird. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3951.96s)]
*  But suddenly, you start hearing, Assad must go. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3954.32s)]
*  I was on Morning Joe when that statement by Hillary was made. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3958.6s)]
*  And Joe Scarborough looked at me and said, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3964.56s)]
*  Jeff, what do you think? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3966.92s)]
*  And I said, well, how are they going to do that? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3968.48s)]
*  That sounds like another pretty stupid idea. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3970.96s)]
*  And it turned out that was 2011. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3974.88s)]
*  We've had 13 years of war in Syria, hundreds of thousands [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3977.4s)]
*  dead. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3981.96s)]
*  Destroyed the country. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3982.32s)]
*  Of course, destroyed the country and whose president, Bashar [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3983.1600000000003s)]
*  al-Assad. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3986.48s)]
*  And interestingly, I can tell you, oh, god. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3987.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I can tell you. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3992.96s)]
*  In 2012, the US, there were protests. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=3994.8s)]
*  There were things that were going on in Syria. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4001.6s)]
*  But the president said, OK, we'll [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4003.56s)]
*  send in the CIA to overthrow the government in Syria. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4005.72s)]
*  And if anyone is wondering, we do this dozens of times. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4010.68s)]
*  So don't have any illusion that this is unusual. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4015.16s)]
*  It is the job, the terms of reference of the CIA [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4018.7599999999998s)]
*  to overthrow governments in other countries, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4023.4s)]
*  I don't approve. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4026.24s)]
*  I think it leads to war, destruction. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4027.24s)]
*  It hasn't passed Putin's notice that that's the job of the CIA. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4030.08s)]
*  So it's another reason he doesn't exactly [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4034.7599999999998s)]
*  want the US on his border and so forth. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4037.12s)]
*  OK, so we start arming the jihadists, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4039.88s)]
*  crazy things in Syria. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4045.56s)]
*  Yeah, I can say it. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4050.12s)]
*  I'm just thinking because. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4051.44s)]
*  And the US says Assad must go. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4055.64s)]
*  So the UN starts a diplomatic process [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4058.4s)]
*  to try to find peace, which is the job of the UN. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4063.76s)]
*  It's not to implement US regime change. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4066.88s)]
*  It's to try to find peace. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4069.44s)]
*  So the UN succeeds in getting all of the parties [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4071.8s)]
*  to agree to a peace agreement, except one, the US. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4076.52s)]
*  So the idea that you couldn't find peace, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4083.88s)]
*  you couldn't find all these different factions in Syria, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4088.24s)]
*  there was an agreement reached. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4093.16s)]
*  But there was one obstacle to the agreement. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4095.3199999999997s)]
*  And the obstacle was the US said on the first day [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4098.679999999999s)]
*  of this agreement, Assad must go. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4101.719999999999s)]
*  And the response was, why don't you have it a process? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4104.679999999999s)]
*  There'll be in two years an election or three years. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4110.04s)]
*  Don't overthrow the government the first day. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4113.16s)]
*  We have all this in place. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4116.16s)]
*  And Obama, well, I don't know if it's Obama, probably Hillary, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4118.88s)]
*  but whatever, said no. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4122.5599999999995s)]
*  So that's why there was no agreement. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4124.72s)]
*  But what was the motive? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4127.8s)]
*  Why would you want to overthrow Bashar al-Assad? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4128.96s)]
*  Very strange. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4133.24s)]
*  I've never heard an absolute intelligent reason for this. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4135.44s)]
*  Believe me, their idea is, we can do it. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4143.0s)]
*  Why not? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4147.76s)]
*  One argument was that the neocons had a list. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4149.12s)]
*  And this is actually what Wesley Clark, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4153.28s)]
*  who was NATO's supreme commander in the end of the 1990s, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4155.96s)]
*  I know Wesley quite well. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4160.96s)]
*  And he's also spoken about this. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4162.44s)]
*  He said the neocons had a list that they [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4164.92s)]
*  were going to clear out in the 2000s all of the governments [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4168.0s)]
*  aligned with the Soviet Union or with Russia. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4172.6s)]
*  Now, Russia has a naval base on the Mediterranean. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4176.400000000001s)]
*  And so Assad is therefore an enemy. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4181.56s)]
*  Or not an enemy. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4186.52s)]
*  He doesn't rise to the level of being an enemy. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4188.08s)]
*  He's someone whose piece you can take off the board [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4190.280000000001s)]
*  and put in your own piece. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4192.92s)]
*  That's all. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4194.200000000001s)]
*  So the idea is incredible arrogance. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4195.200000000001s)]
*  They don't think. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4199.72s)]
*  Honest to God. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4200.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4201.96s)]
*  Whoever gave that order knew nothing about Syria. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4202.56s)]
*  That I can guarantee you. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4206.32s)]
*  But the downstream effects of that were horrifying. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4207.88s)]
*  Well, unbelievable. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4210.84s)]
*  We created ISIS. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4212.6s)]
*  Yeah, but we probably created ISIS pretty directly [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4214.28s)]
*  because we funded jihadists all along the way. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4217.4800000000005s)]
*  That's our story since 1979, actually. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4219.88s)]
*  So this goes back a long time. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4223.68s)]
*  They don't. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4227.92s)]
*  They're not clever. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4229.16s)]
*  They're not honest. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4231.08s)]
*  They're not transparent. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4232.92s)]
*  They are arrogant to the hilt. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4234.8s)]
*  And they don't talk to anybody else, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4237.5599999999995s)]
*  including to us, the American people, including to Congress, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4239.44s)]
*  including to counterparts in other countries. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4242.84s)]
*  And it gets you into trouble when you're [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4246.48s)]
*  so flippant and flagrant. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4250.0s)]
*  Because remember, what was happening in Syria, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4252.5199999999995s)]
*  they did exactly the same thing in Libya. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4255.44s)]
*  And you look at Libya. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4259.76s)]
*  They decided to take out Gaddafi. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4260.8s)]
*  Why? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4263.24s)]
*  No one really knows. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4264.320000000001s)]
*  He was cooperating with us at that point. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4266.12s)]
*  No one knows because some people say [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4268.28s)]
*  Sarkozy that Gaddafi had contributed to Sarkozy's [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4271.400000000001s)]
*  campaign, that it was a personal vendetta. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4277.72s)]
*  There are 100 theories. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4280.72s)]
*  The fact that there are 100 theories [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4282.28s)]
*  shows that the whole thing was bullshit, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4284.400000000001s)]
*  to use a technical diplomatic term. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4287.4400000000005s)]
*  You cannot even know right now why. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4290.12s)]
*  What you know is that they misused the UN Security [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4293.08s)]
*  Council resolution to protect the people of Benghazi [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4296.0s)]
*  to launch a months-long NATO aerial bombardment of Libya [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4299.64s)]
*  until they brought down the government, unleashed war [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4305.5199999999995s)]
*  in Africa for the next 13 years until today, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4309.599999999999s)]
*  which is still roiling all of the countries of the region. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4314.599999999999s)]
*  They do these things because they can, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4319.32s)]
*  because it doesn't count. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4322.88s)]
*  Maybe another theory which is even maybe true. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4324.32s)]
*  What difference? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4330.719999999999s)]
*  It's money. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4331.639999999999s)]
*  It's a business. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4332.679999999999s)]
*  We're running a business. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4333.599999999999s)]
*  We're trying weapons. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4334.719999999999s)]
*  We're doing this. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4335.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's all a success from somebody's point of view [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4336.799999999999s)]
*  that you have all these wars going [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4339.44s)]
*  with this big military machine. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4341.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4342.599999999999s)]
*  That is a theory which is not completely dismissible [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4343.84s)]
*  because what you can't do, Tucker, is look and say, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4347.52s)]
*  my god, we had a geopolitical reason to do this. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4350.84s)]
*  This was really part of American security. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4353.88s)]
*  We really needed to overthrow Assad. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4356.88s)]
*  We really needed to take out Qaddafi [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4359.400000000001s)]
*  because if we didn't do that, something else would happen. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4361.400000000001s)]
*  You cannot even concoct a crazy narrative ex post [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4364.320000000001s)]
*  that explains that. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4370.0s)]
*  So these are not deeply explicable facts. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4371.400000000001s)]
*  But the pattern is recognizable immediately. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4374.84s)]
*  Here you have a country with unchallenged for a moment, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4377.92s)]
*  unchallenged power, starting wars for not any obvious reason [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4381.2s)]
*  all over the world. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4387.360000000001s)]
*  When was the last time an empire did that? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4388.28s)]
*  You know, the British. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4391.2s)]
*  That was the last time. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4394.16s)]
*  I think we learned everything from the British. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4395.360000000001s)]
*  They were nonstop wars, skirmishes. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4398.04s)]
*  When you're an empire, and if anyone still [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4401.28s)]
*  plays Risk, I don't know. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4404.44s)]
*  I played it 60 years ago, I have to admit. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4405.719999999999s)]
*  So I'm not sure if people still play the game. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4408.44s)]
*  But Risk, you're trying to get your peace [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4411.12s)]
*  on every part of the board. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4413.639999999999s)]
*  When you have your peace someplace on the board, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4415.96s)]
*  if the neighboring spots are not yours, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4418.919999999999s)]
*  you better have wars with them or they're [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4421.96s)]
*  going to take you out. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4423.679999999999s)]
*  And so every place becomes an object for war [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4424.96s)]
*  because it becomes next door to wherever [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4429.36s)]
*  you have your bases, your concern, and so on. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4431.76s)]
*  So we have military bases in, I would say, 80 countries [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4436.08s)]
*  probably, something like that. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4442.84s)]
*  Of course, the count is not public, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4445.2s)]
*  so people put together their own lists. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4447.320000000001s)]
*  We have about 750 military bases around the world. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4449.24s)]
*  Each of those places has a neighborhood. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4453.4400000000005s)]
*  Each of those places has the next door, which, oh, well, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4456.12s)]
*  they're not. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4459.8s)]
*  We don't have a base there. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4460.24s)]
*  You better have a base there. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4461.36s)]
*  And so that's the logic, which is [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4463.12s)]
*  if you're at the outer end of this, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4465.5599999999995s)]
*  well, you better continue because otherwise your outer [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4467.639999999999s)]
*  limit is what we don't learn. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4471.28s)]
*  Actually, it's another analogy which I found to be useful. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4474.799999999999s)]
*  The Romans, by around 110 AD with Hadrian, said, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4480.12s)]
*  and Trajan, OK, we've reached a good limit. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4489.04s)]
*  And they stopped trying to expand. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4493.280000000001s)]
*  They built a wall. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4496.96s)]
*  They kind of left it there. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4498.280000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4499.320000000001s)]
*  And they said there was a war that I [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4499.96s)]
*  find analogous to Ukraine. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4505.360000000001s)]
*  They had a war in Germania, so-called, east of the Rhine, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4508.120000000001s)]
*  in what is now Germany, in 9 AD, which [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4514.6s)]
*  was a war of expansion by Augustus [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4519.360000000001s)]
*  to tame the German tribes. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4522.08s)]
*  And they lost that war, the war of the Tuttenberg Forest. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4524.320000000001s)]
*  And they lost that war in 9 AD. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4528.08s)]
*  They basically decided after that, not entirely. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4531.360000000001s)]
*  They didn't say, well, this is the end of the Roman Empire. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4536.04s)]
*  They said, OK, we'll just leave Germania. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4539.68s)]
*  Yeah, there are limits to our power. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4543.08s)]
*  There are limits, and that's fine. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4544.48s)]
*  Why don't we behave like that? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4547.0s)]
*  We're not threatened by Russia. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4549.28s)]
*  We are not threatened by Russia. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4552.959999999999s)]
*  And Ukraine being neutral is not a threat to US security. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4555.4s)]
*  It builds US security, period. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4560.32s)]
*  That's what I said to Jake Sullivan. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4563.799999999999s)]
*  It's not even a concession, Jake. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4565.4s)]
*  It's a benefit for us. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4568.28s)]
*  Leave some space between you and them. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4570.08s)]
*  That's what we want, some space so we [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4574.12s)]
*  don't have an accidental tripwire. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4576.36s)]
*  That's the real logic of this world. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4581.08s)]
*  Give a little space. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4583.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4585.48s)]
*  We don't have to be everywhere. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4586.5199999999995s)]
*  We're not playing risk. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4588.0s)]
*  We're trying to run our lives. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4589.5199999999995s)]
*  We're trying to keep our children safe. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4591.64s)]
*  We're not trying to own every part of the world. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4594.24s)]
*  So speaking of increasing our risk, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4597.32s)]
*  I think the unstated but very clear objective of all of this [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4600.0s)]
*  is to kill Putin and replace him and break up Russia. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4603.36s)]
*  That's my read on it. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4607.04s)]
*  If you read even this project for a new American century [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4608.04s)]
*  rebuilding America's defenses, it [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4613.16s)]
*  says maybe Russia will be decentralized [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4616.32s)]
*  into a European Russia, Central Asian Russia, a Siberian [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4621.639999999999s)]
*  Russia, they call it, and a Far East Russia. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4627.12s)]
*  This is essentially what you're saying. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4630.36s)]
*  They talk, there's even some commissions in Washington [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4632.72s)]
*  decolonizing Russia. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4636.76s)]
*  Their hope, the CIA's hope, if they would ever tell us [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4638.76s)]
*  the truth about anything, was, but they [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4643.6s)]
*  don't get any of this right, but their thought probably [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4648.64s)]
*  in this deep long-term vision was after the Soviet Union fell, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4651.92s)]
*  so too will Russia disintegrate. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4657.8s)]
*  It will disintegrate along its ethnic lines. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4660.12s)]
*  It will disintegrate along its geographic lines. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4663.24s)]
*  Why is that a US project? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4666.88s)]
*  It's a US project only because, from my point of view, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4669.72s)]
*  the US resents that there is a country of 11 time zones, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4673.8s)]
*  and it's so big that it is on its face [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4679.28s)]
*  a denial of US global hegemony. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4682.92s)]
*  In other words, how obnoxious of them to be there. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4685.88s)]
*  But the problem is, they don't see it that way. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4691.6s)]
*  But just if you're looking at this purely [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4695.24s)]
*  through the lens of what's good for us, US interests, which [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4697.16s)]
*  I do think is their job, actually, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4699.76s)]
*  chaos across 11 time zones and innumerable ethnic groups [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4703.24s)]
*  and religious divisions with 6,000 nuclear warheads, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4707.92s)]
*  that's really a threat to the world. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4713.36s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4715.88s)]
*  Is it not? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4716.92s)]
*  Am I missing something? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4717.44s)]
*  No, you're not missing anything. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4718.28s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is, I was an advisor [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4720.32s)]
*  to Gorbachev in 1990, 1991. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4724.4s)]
*  I got to watch close up. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4728.36s)]
*  I was an advisor to President Yeltsin in 1991, 1992. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4730.599999999999s)]
*  I actually, it's literally true, as weird as this sounds, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4737.08s)]
*  well, maybe not to you. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4744.12s)]
*  You're about the one person for whom it's not weird. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4745.84s)]
*  I sat in the Kremlin sitting across from Yeltsin [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4748.32s)]
*  the day the Soviet Union ended. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4754.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4757.2s)]
*  In a really, not even quite that day, literally. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4758.2s)]
*  It was even more remarkable and bizarre than that. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4762.76s)]
*  I was leading a little economics delegation [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4766.04s)]
*  to talk about the collapse of the economy that was underway. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4769.28s)]
*  And Yeltsin came from the back of the room [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4774.68s)]
*  in one of these giant Kremlin rooms [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4777.0s)]
*  and walked across the long room and sat down right in front [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4779.56s)]
*  of me and said, gentlemen, I want to tell you [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4783.68s)]
*  the Soviet Union is over. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4789.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4791.96s)]
*  Like that. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4792.68s)]
*  And then he pointed to the back door. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4793.52s)]
*  He said, do you know who is in that room over there? [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4796.4800000000005s)]
*  It's the leaders of the Soviet military. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4800.280000000001s)]
*  And they have just agreed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4804.240000000001s)]
*  And that was the first words I heard out of his mouth, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4808.68s)]
*  sitting directly across from me. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4812.320000000001s)]
*  So what a moment. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4815.84s)]
*  Yeah, that was, of course, the most unbelievable moment [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4817.56s)]
*  I've had. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4821.64s)]
*  And you're sitting in the Kremlin, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4822.8s)]
*  and you hear that suddenly. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4824.72s)]
*  And then he went on to say, he spoke very beautifully [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4827.76s)]
*  for a few minutes. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4831.92s)]
*  What does Russia want? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4832.8s)]
*  And he must have used the word normal 10 times [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4835.320000000001s)]
*  in that short speech. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4839.56s)]
*  We want to be a normal country. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4841.200000000001s)]
*  We're done with the communism. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4844.400000000001s)]
*  We want to be normal. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4846.52s)]
*  We want to be friendly. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4848.360000000001s)]
*  We want to be part of Europe. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4850.12s)]
*  We want to be part of the world economy. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4851.84s)]
*  We want to be normal. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4854.16s)]
*  Mr. Sacks, can you help us be normal? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4856.04s)]
*  And I said, Mr. President, the world [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4859.5599999999995s)]
*  will be so grateful for this opportunity for peace [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4864.44s)]
*  that I am absolutely sure that the United States [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4868.5599999999995s)]
*  and the rest of the world is going [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4873.8s)]
*  to come to your assistance. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4875.44s)]
*  And I said this most remarkably wrong fact [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4878.08s)]
*  because I believed it. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4883.28s)]
*  I knew that that was America's interest. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4886.24s)]
*  I believed we would follow our interest. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4889.96s)]
*  And I had had a very unusual experience, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4893.08s)]
*  wonderful experience two years earlier [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4897.8s)]
*  when I served as Poland's main outside economic advisor, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4900.68s)]
*  helping them to develop the plan for becoming a market [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4905.96s)]
*  economy and part of Europe. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4908.84s)]
*  And in those days, I helped Poland [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4911.2s)]
*  raise many billions of dollars of emergency support [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4914.44s)]
*  to stabilize a very shaky, unstable economy. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4918.64s)]
*  And in those days in 1989, everything I recommended [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4923.8s)]
*  was adopted by the United States government almost immediately. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4930.36s)]
*  I thought, hey, I'm pretty good. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4934.28s)]
*  I once went in one morning to Senator Dole, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4936.92s)]
*  and I said, Poland needs a billion dollars [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4941.759999999999s)]
*  to stabilize its currency. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4944.08s)]
*  And he said, Mr. Sacks, come back in an hour. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4946.16s)]
*  And I came back in an hour, and there was Brent Scowcroft [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4950.28s)]
*  and our national security advisor. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4954.36s)]
*  Senator Dole said, you know who this is, Mr. Sacks. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4958.0s)]
*  I said, General, it's an honor to meet you. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4960.5599999999995s)]
*  And Scowcroft said, what's your idea? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4964.04s)]
*  And I handed him my one page about a billion dollars. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4967.92s)]
*  And he looked and he said, will this work, Mr. Sacks? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4971.68s)]
*  And I said, I think this is the right way [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4974.88s)]
*  to stabilize the currency. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4977.0s)]
*  He said, well, we'll get back to you. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4979.04s)]
*  And at 5 PM, as Dole asked me, I called Dole, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4981.8s)]
*  and he said, tell your friends they have their billion [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4988.92s)]
*  dollars within eight hours, basically. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4992.0s)]
*  So I said to Yeltsin, this will be great. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=4997.48s)]
*  You're going to get all the support. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5002.92s)]
*  We're going to go mobilize a financial package for you. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5004.76s)]
*  We're going to help you stabilize the ruble. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5007.4s)]
*  We're going to get a stabilization [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5009.6s)]
*  fund for the ruble. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5011.12s)]
*  We're going to get this and that. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5012.08s)]
*  And of course, every single thing [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5013.68s)]
*  I recommended that had worked in Poland, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5015.96s)]
*  they rejected in Washington. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5017.96s)]
*  And just for the life of me, what the hell [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5020.96s)]
*  is going on here? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5024.16s)]
*  Stabilization fund. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5025.84s)]
*  It worked. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5027.12s)]
*  The Zloty was stable. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5028.36s)]
*  The Polish currency stabilized. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5029.92s)]
*  No, Mr. Sacks, I'm afraid we don't support that. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5031.96s)]
*  And one after another, knocked down. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5035.24s)]
*  So I did not understand the geopolitics that I was in at all. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5038.96s)]
*  I didn't get it. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5044.24s)]
*  I said, are you kidding? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5045.44s)]
*  They want normal. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5046.84s)]
*  They want peace. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5047.84s)]
*  This is our greatest moment. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5048.64s)]
*  This is the greatest moment of the second half [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5050.0s)]
*  of the 20th century. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5052.32s)]
*  The scourge of nuclear war has been lifted. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5054.2s)]
*  The Cold War is over. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5056.92s)]
*  Do something. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5058.44s)]
*  No. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5060.2s)]
*  So that's it. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5062.88s)]
*  What do you make of Putin? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5064.44s)]
*  He's very smart. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5066.56s)]
*  He has led Russia very effectively. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5068.68s)]
*  And because he emerged from the KGB, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5074.12s)]
*  he understands the way the US operates, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5078.72s)]
*  because we became a security state. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5083.12s)]
*  We became a state where the CIA has absolutely extraordinary [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5085.88s)]
*  influence. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5091.16s)]
*  And Putin gets that. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5092.4400000000005s)]
*  And so he really understands how we operate. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5094.280000000001s)]
*  He doesn't like it, but he understands it. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5098.400000000001s)]
*  And his background, especially because his background [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5101.12s)]
*  comes from the KGB, his counterpart was the CIA. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5105.32s)]
*  He does not have illusions about the United States. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5109.759999999999s)]
*  And I wish we were proving him wrong, but we're not. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5113.5599999999995s)]
*  How influential is the CIA in the operations [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5120.0s)]
*  of the US government? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5122.88s)]
*  Definitely in many, many places, it [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5125.639999999999s)]
*  is the instrument of regime change. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5129.32s)]
*  The US is the only country in the world [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5133.08s)]
*  that relies on regime change, as I would say, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5136.48s)]
*  the lead diplomatic. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5139.48s)]
*  Let me put it a different way. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5142.48s)]
*  Not diplomatic, as the lead foreign policy instrument. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5144.16s)]
*  In other words, most countries, virtually any small country, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5148.6s)]
*  any middle power country, when it doesn't like another country, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5153.08s)]
*  it either has to deal with it, or it [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5158.16s)]
*  comes begging to the United States to take out [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5160.64s)]
*  that country. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5163.04s)]
*  And we are the country that makes a living [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5164.72s)]
*  by overthrowing other governments. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5169.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's not a good vocation for us. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5171.92s)]
*  It almost always ends in disaster, in bloodshed, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5176.400000000001s)]
*  in continued instability. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5181.280000000001s)]
*  But that's the job of the CIA. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5184.320000000001s)]
*  It's half the job of the CIA. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5187.320000000001s)]
*  CIA is also an intelligence agency. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5188.84s)]
*  It collects information and makes analysis, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5191.4800000000005s)]
*  and it gives intelligence findings. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5194.360000000001s)]
*  And I have no problem with that role at all, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5197.68s)]
*  although I don't want them to spy on us. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5200.76s)]
*  But I think that making intelligence findings [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5202.76s)]
*  for the US government is necessary. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5206.28s)]
*  But being a private army or a hidden force [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5212.0s)]
*  that overthrows governments, that stokes unrest, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5218.16s)]
*  that puts people in power, that runs covert operations, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5222.04s)]
*  I'm against it. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5229.12s)]
*  So if a big part of the CIA's job [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5230.36s)]
*  is taking down leaders of foreign countries, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5233.28s)]
*  how long before it does that here in the United States? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5238.72s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't seem unlikely that, like, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5241.96s)]
*  why wouldn't they do that here? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5244.8s)]
*  Yeah, probably 61 years ago was their first run at this [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5246.28s)]
*  with President Kennedy from, I think it's best guess, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5250.8s)]
*  not sure, but best guess that this was at least maybe rogue [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5255.759999999999s)]
*  CIA or maybe official CIA or maybe [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5262.28s)]
*  compartmentalized CIA operation. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5266.0s)]
*  It was clearly someone's operation, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5269.16s)]
*  not Lee Harvey Oswald's from all we know. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5271.32s)]
*  And all of the evidence points in that direction. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5275.36s)]
*  It used to be said, why is the United States [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5279.2s)]
*  the only country in the world that's never had a coup? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5281.759999999999s)]
*  And the answer was, well, we're the only country that [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5285.24s)]
*  doesn't have a US embassy. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5287.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, of course, we've had a coup. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5291.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, murdering the president is a coup. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5292.759999999999s)]
*  But we probably had a coup in broad daylight [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5294.5199999999995s)]
*  on November 22nd, 1963. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5296.679999999999s)]
*  And we never quite got over it. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5299.12s)]
*  And we never looked into it. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5302.24s)]
*  On the contrary, we covered it up from the beginning. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5306.84s)]
*  And drip by drip, evidence comes, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5309.36s)]
*  including the most recent evidence [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5312.32s)]
*  that that magic bullet, which was [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5314.72s)]
*  one of the justifications of the absurd account of a lone gunman, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5316.84s)]
*  was also debunked by the, I think now, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5322.84s)]
*  88-year-old Secret Service agent who said, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5326.72s)]
*  I actually put that bullet from the back of Kennedy's seat [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5330.56s)]
*  in the limousine on the stretcher at Parkland Hospital. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5334.8s)]
*  So there's so many things wrong with the official evidence. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5338.6s)]
*  Preposterous. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5342.88s)]
*  Almost nobody believes it or should believe it. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5344.080000000001s)]
*  But it's also interesting for all that we're discussing. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5347.6s)]
*  Most likely, it was a government coup in broad daylight [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5351.76s)]
*  with a tremendous amount of evidence [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5355.76s)]
*  that it was a conspiracy at a high level. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5358.44s)]
*  And yet, it passed for the last 61 years [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5362.28s)]
*  without any official practical note of that fact. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5367.839999999999s)]
*  Do you think that was the last time the CIA tried to influence [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5374.0s)]
*  domestic politics in this country? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5376.919999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm sure the CIA influences [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5378.5599999999995s)]
*  domestic politics all the time in this country, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5382.16s)]
*  because we know about extensive surveillance operations. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5384.2s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5388.96s)]
*  Next year will be the 50th anniversary [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5390.04s)]
*  of the Church Committee hearings. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5393.36s)]
*  And Frank Church was a very unusual figure from Idaho, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5395.679999999999s)]
*  a pretty staunch Republican state. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5401.4s)]
*  And he was a young, gifted patriot [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5403.719999999999s)]
*  whose favorite senator was Bora, a conservative Republican [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5409.76s)]
*  senator. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5415.24s)]
*  And he was just an upright, very decent person [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5416.2s)]
*  who saw more and more, my god, the things [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5421.5599999999995s)]
*  we're talking about. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5427.04s)]
*  Something's not right. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5427.96s)]
*  People are getting assassinated in other countries. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5429.96s)]
*  Our government, it doesn't look clean. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5432.5199999999995s)]
*  And one thing after another in a series of events [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5436.5599999999995s)]
*  led him to chair the only time a Senate investigative committee [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5442.56s)]
*  actually looked deeply into CIA operations. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5450.52s)]
*  That was 1975. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5455.6s)]
*  Fascinating. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5458.360000000001s)]
*  What made it possible was just a confluence of events. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5460.080000000001s)]
*  Nixon had resigned. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5465.96s)]
*  Ford was an unelected president who came from Congress, who [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5467.88s)]
*  didn't want to take on Congress. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5471.36s)]
*  So he didn't resist Church's investigation, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5473.5599999999995s)]
*  even though his chief of staff, Dick Cheney, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5479.36s)]
*  was telling him, go after this guy. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5482.44s)]
*  We've got to crush this investigation. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5484.28s)]
*  But Ford said, no, no, no, we can't. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5486.32s)]
*  In any way, the Supreme Court, and I [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5490.5599999999995s)]
*  don't want to get into another huge fight. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5492.24s)]
*  Hoover had died. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5495.16s)]
*  J. Edgar Hoover had died in 1972, I believe. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5497.48s)]
*  So the FBI couldn't resist the same way. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5500.84s)]
*  Bill Colby had become CIA director, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5506.12s)]
*  and he didn't want to inherit all the shit from the past CIA. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5508.4800000000005s)]
*  So there came this one moment when all these pieces enabled [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5512.400000000001s)]
*  actually someone to look into what this organization was [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5517.0s)]
*  doing. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5521.4800000000005s)]
*  And the first thing they discovered [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5522.24s)]
*  was no one had ever looked into any of it before. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5523.66s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5526.76s)]
*  Second, they discovered this is an army of the president [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5527.8s)]
*  of the United States. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5532.16s)]
*  This is a private army. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5534.0s)]
*  And they debated, is it a rogue army? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5535.72s)]
*  Does it do it on its own, or is it an army of the president? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5538.24s)]
*  But it's an army, and it's an army completely outside [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5541.08s)]
*  of our oversight and control. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5544.4800000000005s)]
*  Then the third thing they found is they're [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5546.64s)]
*  assassinating lots of people. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5548.400000000001s)]
*  They're assassinating Americans, by the way, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5550.24s)]
*  through these unbelievably crazy LSD experiments. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5552.04s)]
*  Basically, they weren't the ones to put the bullet [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5557.96s)]
*  through the head of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5561.4800000000005s)]
*  but they tried, and they supported [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5563.6s)]
*  the overthrow of Lumumba. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5567.72s)]
*  And of course, they were trying to kill Castro [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5569.88s)]
*  and many other things. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5572.52s)]
*  So they found unbelievable things. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5573.76s)]
*  Now that was 1975. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5576.64s)]
*  Since then, we're 49 years. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5578.68s)]
*  There's never been another church committee of its kind. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5581.52s)]
*  It's unbelievable how many things [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5585.12s)]
*  have happened since then. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5587.72s)]
*  The list, believe me, is very, very long. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5589.2s)]
*  I've seen some of it so directly. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5592.72s)]
*  It's just shocking to me. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5596.6s)]
*  But just an insight into how our country works, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5598.92s)]
*  which you know very well. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5603.16s)]
*  But to me, I find it so weird. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5604.56s)]
*  I was asked to help Aristide in Haiti. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5609.04s)]
*  Haiti's so poor, so unstable, so desperate. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5614.68s)]
*  And Aristide asked me for economic help. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5619.280000000001s)]
*  That's what I do. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5623.320000000001s)]
*  That's my expertise. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5624.4400000000005s)]
*  So I flew down to Port-au-Prince, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5625.92s)]
*  and I had a very good meeting with him. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5629.68s)]
*  And at the end of the meeting, he said, Mr. Sacks, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5631.84s)]
*  they're going to take me out. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5634.320000000001s)]
*  They're going to take me out. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5635.4400000000005s)]
*  And what do you mean? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5637.52s)]
*  Is it they're going to overthrow me? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5638.72s)]
*  Sorry to be so naive as I am. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5642.8s)]
*  I said, no, we're going to make this work. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5645.28s)]
*  We're going to make this work. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5649.32s)]
*  No, no, no, they're going to take me out. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5650.28s)]
*  I said, no, no, I'm going back to Washington. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5651.639999999999s)]
*  We're going to help with the Inter-American Development [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5653.72s)]
*  Bank, and World Bank, and IMF. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5656.5199999999995s)]
*  And oh, I'm so naive. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5658.36s)]
*  So of course, then they decide to take them out. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5661.48s)]
*  And the way they do it is destabilize the country. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5667.4s)]
*  So the first thing is close down the IMF, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5671.12s)]
*  close down the World Bank, close down [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5673.5599999999995s)]
*  the Inter-American Development Bank, squeeze, squeeze, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5675.44s)]
*  squeeze. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5677.8s)]
*  The next thing is you send in some mercenaries [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5678.48s)]
*  who are going to create trouble, come over the border [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5681.32s)]
*  from Dominican Republic. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5683.76s)]
*  The last thing was rather remarkable, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5685.28s)]
*  which was the US ambassador showed up at his door [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5687.48s)]
*  literally one day and said, Mr. President, you have to flee. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5690.599999999999s)]
*  We have a plane waiting for you. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5694.68s)]
*  Otherwise, your life is in danger. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5696.48s)]
*  And they led him to a plane with an unmarked tail. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5698.72s)]
*  And 23 hours later, he was in Central African Republic. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5702.12s)]
*  So this is what's called a coup in broad daylight. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5706.16s)]
*  Central African Republic. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5709.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5711.52s)]
*  I thought he went to Joburg. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5712.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5713.4400000000005s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5714.08s)]
*  He went afterwards. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5714.64s)]
*  But the first, the landing was Central African Republic, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5716.16s)]
*  if I remember correctly. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5718.88s)]
*  So what do I do? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5720.240000000001s)]
*  What can I do? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5724.64s)]
*  I called up the New York Times reporter on the beat. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5726.28s)]
*  And I said, there's been a coup on broad daylight. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5729.759999999999s)]
*  You've got to cover this. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5733.44s)]
*  The reporter told me, my editor is not interested. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5735.639999999999s)]
*  A coup in our hemisphere. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5742.24s)]
*  All the news that's fit to print. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5743.639999999999s)]
*  So I have one. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5746.16s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5747.639999999999s)]
*  So I wanted to ask you about that. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5748.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, you said there have been no, correctly, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5750.08s)]
*  there have been no real oversight hearings [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5752.44s)]
*  into the intel agencies in 50 years. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5754.52s)]
*  But the congressional committees are only [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5757.400000000001s)]
*  one part of the oversight the Constitution prescribes. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5759.8s)]
*  And the other part, of course, is the media. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5762.4800000000005s)]
*  Right? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5764.64s)]
*  Supposed to provide oversight. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5765.160000000001s)]
*  Oversight of government. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5767.160000000001s)]
*  And the moment I really wanted to speak to you [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5768.280000000001s)]
*  was the day that I saw the clip of you on Bloomberg News. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5772.8s)]
*  I think you were right. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5776.120000000001s)]
*  One of my favorite moments. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5776.96s)]
*  And we used to describe, and it was within hours [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5778.240000000001s)]
*  of this massive natural gas pipeline Nord Stream [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5781.2s)]
*  disintegrating. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5784.679999999999s)]
*  Can you describe what happened? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5786.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5787.639999999999s)]
*  So the US blew up Nord Stream, as it promised to on probably [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5788.139999999999s)]
*  dozens of occasions. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5794.599999999999s)]
*  But the most recent of those occasions [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5796.4s)]
*  was President Biden said, I think it's February 7, 2022. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5799.16s)]
*  I may have the date a little bit off. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5807.72s)]
*  But he said in a statement to the press, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5809.88s)]
*  if the Russians invade Ukraine, Nord Stream is finished. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5812.88s)]
*  And the reporter who asked him the question, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5817.96s)]
*  I think from Germany, but international, said, well, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5820.72s)]
*  Mr. President, how can you say that? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5824.24s)]
*  How could you do that? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5827.4400000000005s)]
*  And he looks and he says very gravely, believe me, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5828.36s)]
*  we have our ways. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5832.56s)]
*  OK, so this is, and then you can go back and find [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5833.92s)]
*  a thousand clips of Victoria Nuland. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5837.08s)]
*  And Cruz and everyone saying, this must stop. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5840.08s)]
*  This must stop. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5843.160000000001s)]
*  We'll never let it happen. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5843.76s)]
*  It will be destroyed. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5844.96s)]
*  It will be ended. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5845.88s)]
*  OK, so then it's blown up. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5847.0s)]
*  OK, and then the American, well, before we get to that, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5850.400000000001s)]
*  I was on Bloomberg soon afterwards. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5857.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't remember whether it was the next day or the day [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5860.4400000000005s)]
*  after. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5862.68s)]
*  And I said, you know, I think the US did this. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5863.18s)]
*  Mr. Sacks, how can you say that? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5868.12s)]
*  And I said, well, first, the president [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5872.04s)]
*  said it was going to be over. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5874.36s)]
*  And then there's actually some readings [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5877.4s)]
*  of planes in the vicinity and so forth. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5879.8s)]
*  And there was the tweet by the former and now current foreign [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5882.68s)]
*  minister of Poland, thank you, USA, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5890.92s)]
*  with a picture of the water bubbling over the blown up [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5893.36s)]
*  pipeline, Roddick Sikorski's tweet. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5900.799999999999s)]
*  And Applebaum's husband, they should say. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5905.599999999999s)]
*  There was a bit of evidence that, well, yes, the United [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5907.5599999999995s)]
*  States had done this. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5910.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5910.92s)]
*  They said they would, and they did it. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5911.96s)]
*  I was yanked off the air within 30 seconds. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5915.12s)]
*  I could watch. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5918.2s)]
*  I could imagine, because he was listening to something [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5921.08s)]
*  in the earplug, which I could only imagine, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5924.16s)]
*  get that son of a bitch off the air. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5926.04s)]
*  And they just, this interview's over. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5928.16s)]
*  And he stopped. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5930.84s)]
*  And then another anchor berated me for a few minutes [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5932.48s)]
*  after that. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5938.08s)]
*  And OK, that was the last time I had a word on mainstream media, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5939.16s)]
*  I have to tell you. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5945.36s)]
*  Seriously? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5946.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5946.64s)]
*  But you've been famous, because I [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5947.92s)]
*  live in this country, I know. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5950.56s)]
*  You've been famous for decades. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5951.8s)]
*  I was on everything, MSNBC. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5954.080000000001s)]
*  Like a lot. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5957.52s)]
*  Yeah, a lot, constantly. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5958.200000000001s)]
*  But it's so interesting that your sin [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5960.360000000001s)]
*  was saying something true that the media really should be on. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5962.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is the largest act of industrial sabotage [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5966.84s)]
*  in my lifetime. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5969.64s)]
*  It's the largest carbon emission ever. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5970.6s)]
*  Look, it's a big deal. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5975.360000000001s)]
*  It's an act of war. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5976.96s)]
*  It helps to understand what this Ukraine war is all about. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5978.8s)]
*  It helps us to understand that this [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5982.4400000000005s)]
*  is a war between the United States and Russia [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5984.400000000001s)]
*  fought on many means. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5987.08s)]
*  It's important to understand it. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5988.72s)]
*  It also has a deeper economic significance, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5990.88s)]
*  because it's part of a longstanding US idea of not [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=5995.320000000001s)]
*  letting Germany and Russia ever get too close together [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6001.400000000001s)]
*  economically. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6004.28s)]
*  So there's a lot to that story. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6005.84s)]
*  But the media should be covering that. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6009.0s)]
*  Look, if you can kill a president in broad daylight [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6011.04s)]
*  and get away with it for 61 years, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6015.32s)]
*  if you can walk a president of a neighboring country [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6017.799999999999s)]
*  out to an unmarked plane and not have it covered, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6021.759999999999s)]
*  if you can have a quote, unprovoked war [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6025.919999999999s)]
*  that you provoked over a 30-year period, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6028.24s)]
*  you can do lots of things. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6030.959999999999s)]
*  And this is just one of the things that you could do. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6032.759999999999s)]
*  And I discovered that some of our press, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6036.8s)]
*  like the New York Times, which opined after the blowup that, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6042.64s)]
*  looks like Russia did that to their own infrastructure, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6049.92s)]
*  their reporters, their top reporters, no better. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6055.0s)]
*  They tell me, yeah, Jeff, of course, of course. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6058.2s)]
*  But they don't cover it, because we're [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6061.88s)]
*  living in an environment where the people in power [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6065.44s)]
*  think it's a game. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6069.96s)]
*  And they think that it's not their job to tell us. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6071.839999999999s)]
*  They're playing risk with our lives. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6076.48s)]
*  They're playing risk with Ukrainian lives. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6079.32s)]
*  They don't have to tell us the truth. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6081.96s)]
*  We don't have to have any serious discussion. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6084.08s)]
*  We don't have to call anyone for a real hearing [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6088.4s)]
*  or even much less a congressional investigation. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6092.36s)]
*  We're not living in that kind of world. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6097.5199999999995s)]
*  We're living in a world where it's almost daily [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6099.639999999999s)]
*  that the government says what it wants. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6104.679999999999s)]
*  Kirby at the White House says it with that damn smirk of his. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6108.96s)]
*  And pretty much everyone knows it's lies. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6115.12s)]
*  But why haven't it's just interesting, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6120.0s)]
*  because you're from a very specific class, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6121.88s)]
*  well-known academic economist, diplomat, frequent TV guest. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6125.92s)]
*  And there are a bunch of other people in that world. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6130.72s)]
*  But you were pretty much the only person to say, no, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6134.24s)]
*  that's a lie. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6137.24s)]
*  And I'm not going along with it. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6137.8s)]
*  Why you? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6139.76s)]
*  Why do you do what all of your peers did? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6140.6s)]
*  I do it because it came as part of my life course working [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6144.28s)]
*  mostly internationally, talking with the leaders abroad. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6151.28s)]
*  I care about my credibility a lot, which is I'm not always [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6157.08s)]
*  right, but I try to always be right. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6160.8s)]
*  And I have a lot of discussions every day [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6163.2s)]
*  with foreign ministers or with senior diplomats [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6166.5599999999995s)]
*  or with heads of state. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6169.8s)]
*  And for me, I don't hold an office. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6171.639999999999s)]
*  I don't do anything other than try to have reasonable ideas [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6175.2s)]
*  and speak as truthfully as possible. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6180.4s)]
*  So it's kind of a career approach, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6182.16s)]
*  which is I'm trying to be accurate. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6184.96s)]
*  Right, but there should be a lot of people like you in your world. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6186.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6190.4s)]
*  I know for me, I'm not interested. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6193.0s)]
*  And I would not take a job in the US government, for example. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6196.879999999999s)]
*  I quote it anyway with all the things I've said. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6200.48s)]
*  I can imagine the congressional hearings. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6203.32s)]
*  It would be, did you say that about the US government? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6205.2s)]
*  Did you say that about the US government? [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6207.44s)]
*  In any event, I'm not looking for a job. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6209.16s)]
*  I'm not looking for a USAID grant. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6211.88s)]
*  I'm not looking for a US government grant. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6214.08s)]
*  So in that sense also, I'm not exactly, I hope, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6216.5199999999995s)]
*  trapped in that way. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6225.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm just trying to be accurate. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6227.28s)]
*  And what I'm really, really trying [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6231.68s)]
*  is to help the United States government understand [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6234.04s)]
*  that they're operating on dangerous trajectories [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6239.04s)]
*  and with a lot of delusions. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6244.6s)]
*  And it's very risky for everybody. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6246.68s)]
*  And I also have a big measure of resentment. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6249.56s)]
*  I don't like the risks that were being put under Tucker. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6252.92s)]
*  Yes, I agree with that completely. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6255.36s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6256.84s)]
*  You've got children. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6258.0s)]
*  This is not a game. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6258.84s)]
*  I got grandchildren. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6260.32s)]
*  And I really care about this. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6261.76s)]
*  And I don't like the games. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6263.4s)]
*  And I want people to tell the truth. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6265.64s)]
*  If we told the truth, we could actually stop the wars today. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6268.52s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6274.96s)]
*  It's not crazy. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6276.04s)]
*  If we told the truth about Ukraine, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6277.48s)]
*  if Biden called Putin and said that NATO enlargement we've [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6279.92s)]
*  been trying for 30 years, it's off. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6284.4s)]
*  We get it. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6286.92s)]
*  You're right. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6287.84s)]
*  It's not going to your border. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6288.64s)]
*  Ukraine should be neutral. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6290.08s)]
*  That war would stop today. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6291.72s)]
*  There'd be lots of pieces to figure out [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6294.76s)]
*  where exactly will the borders be? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6297.0s)]
*  How will it go? [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6298.8s)]
*  I don't say that there won't be issues. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6300.84s)]
*  But the fighting would stop today. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6303.52s)]
*  If the government of Israel either were told or said, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6306.88s)]
*  there will be a state of Palestine [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6312.2s)]
*  and we will live peacefully side by side, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6314.64s)]
*  the fighting would stop today. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6317.4s)]
*  These are basic facts, basic matters of truth [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6319.719999999999s)]
*  that if we actually spoke them, if we actually [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6324.12s)]
*  treated each other like grownups, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6328.32s)]
*  we would resolve what seemed to be these insurmountable [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6330.4s)]
*  crises. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6339.16s)]
*  They're not at all insurmountable. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6339.919999999999s)]
*  They just require a measure of truth. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6341.799999999999s)]
*  How have you been treated by your peers for the war? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6344.44s)]
*  How have you been treated by your peers for saying things [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6347.56s)]
*  like, I hear what you just said, and I think it's indisputable. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6350.160000000001s)]
*  It's also very honorable. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6354.240000000001s)]
*  You seem to be acting out of the best motives, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6356.56s)]
*  traditional American motives, I would say. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6358.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to think that. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6360.280000000001s)]
*  So I admire you for saying that. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6361.400000000001s)]
*  How have your peers responded to you? [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6363.360000000001s)]
*  They think I'm a little crazy, I think. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6365.64s)]
*  What would be crazy about what you just said? [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6368.52s)]
*  Well, when I said that this war has a reason, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6370.52s)]
*  that it's not that Putin's evil, that we provoke this, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6377.44s)]
*  and that it could stop, I got most of my remaining [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6382.4s)]
*  interlocutors saying, Jeff, what is the matter with you? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6389.799999999999s)]
*  You're Putin apologist? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6393.5599999999995s)]
*  How dare you? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6395.2s)]
*  When I say this about Israel, I lose another group. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6396.5599999999995s)]
*  Because there are things you're supposed to say here. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6400.679999999999s)]
*  Because this idea of US hegemony, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6404.44s)]
*  this idea of US dominance, it's pretty deep [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6409.679999999999s)]
*  in American academia also. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6414.839999999999s)]
*  It's not a shock to tell you, but all [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6418.16s)]
*  of these special organizations, the think tanks or university [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6420.639999999999s)]
*  special departments or research units, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6430.12s)]
*  they're funded by the US government. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6434.64s)]
*  They're funded by the security state. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6436.72s)]
*  They're funded by large donors that [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6438.4s)]
*  are all part of this story. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6440.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's not absolutely simple to get out of that. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6442.08s)]
*  I think Mark Twain, I think he was the one that said it. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6449.08s)]
*  It may have been Menken, but I think [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6452.72s)]
*  it's attributed to Twain that said, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6454.12s)]
*  it's impossible to convince a man of something [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6458.08s)]
*  when his job depends on believing the other. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6460.4s)]
*  And I think that's true of a lot of people, which is, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6465.36s)]
*  I can't really say that. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6468.6s)]
*  I don't know if it's true. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6470.4s)]
*  But anyway, why are you sticking your head out so much? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6471.56s)]
*  I got to ask you about, first of all, thank you. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6475.8s)]
*  I think that's the crispest and I think most honest description [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6479.12s)]
*  I've ever heard of the lead up to what's [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6484.16s)]
*  happening in Ukraine right now. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6486.36s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6487.56s)]
*  So given the credibility that you just gained [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6489.400000000001s)]
*  by that explanation, where do you think COVID came from? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6491.360000000001s)]
*  COVID, the question is which lab and in which way. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6495.120000000001s)]
*  It almost surely did not come out of nature. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6500.4800000000005s)]
*  It almost surely came out of a deliberate research project [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6504.400000000001s)]
*  that had a core idea, which was to take [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6511.52s)]
*  a natural virus and make it more infectious. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6515.88s)]
*  And we have one major blueprint of that, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6519.6s)]
*  which is a research proposal called [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6524.400000000001s)]
*  Diffuse, which was submitted to the Department of Defense [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6527.72s)]
*  to the unit called DARPA in 2018. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6533.04s)]
*  And it is a kind of cookbook for how [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6537.32s)]
*  to make the virus that causes COVID-19. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6540.36s)]
*  And the virus is called SARS-CoV-2. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6543.76s)]
*  And what's distinctive about SARS-CoV-2 [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6546.400000000001s)]
*  is that it has something called a proteolytic cleavage site [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6550.12s)]
*  and specifically something called a furin cleavage site. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6556.72s)]
*  And it's just some pieces of the genome that [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6560.320000000001s)]
*  make this thing damn infectious. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6564.4400000000005s)]
*  And what's interesting about it is [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6567.76s)]
*  that for this class of bat viruses, which are called beta [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6569.8s)]
*  coronaviruses, which is what SARS comes from [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6574.68s)]
*  and what COVID-19 comes from, for that class of viruses, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6579.56s)]
*  and there are several hundred known, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6583.4800000000005s)]
*  none of them in nature ever had that particular piece [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6585.8s)]
*  of the genome called. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6590.4400000000005s)]
*  None? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6591.400000000001s)]
*  None, other than SARS-CoV-2. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6591.92s)]
*  And that piece of the genome, the furin cleavage site, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6595.8s)]
*  was an object of research attention from 2005 [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6601.56s)]
*  because it was understood that if a virus were to have that, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6608.04s)]
*  it would make the entry of the virus into human cells easier [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6612.76s)]
*  and would make the virus, therefore, infectious [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6617.08s)]
*  for humans. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6619.76s)]
*  SARS-1, which was the first outbreak of a virus like this [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6620.8s)]
*  in 2003 in Hong Kong, was most likely a natural virus that [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6626.52s)]
*  came from a farm animal. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6634.52s)]
*  And it was not so infectious. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6637.68s)]
*  It killed some thousands of people. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6640.04s)]
*  But with SARS-1, you got very, very sick for weeks [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6642.04s)]
*  before you were infectious to someone else. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6647.400000000001s)]
*  And that meant that it was not so hard to stop by isolating [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6650.48s)]
*  people who had the symptoms. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6653.839999999999s)]
*  With SARS-CoV-2, you are infectious even [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6656.0s)]
*  without any symptoms. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6660.679999999999s)]
*  Sometimes you're completely asymptomatic. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6662.24s)]
*  So what's the difference of SARS-1 and SARS-CoV-2? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6665.24s)]
*  The furin cleavage site. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6670.919999999999s)]
*  And in 2005 already, so almost 20 years ago, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6673.08s)]
*  that experiment was done that said, oh, take SARS-1. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6678.36s)]
*  Add in a furin cleavage site. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6681.5199999999995s)]
*  This thing becomes really infectious. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6683.679999999999s)]
*  And there are a series of experiments, 2005, 2009, 2011, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6686.599999999999s)]
*  that are called gain-of-function experiments [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6691.639999999999s)]
*  where you deliberately manipulate the virus [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6694.36s)]
*  to make it more infectious. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6697.48s)]
*  By 2015, we had a full-blown research program funded by NIH, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6699.719999999999s)]
*  by Tony Fauci's unit, on beta coronaviruses already [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6707.16s)]
*  with the lead scientists focusing on this furin cleavage [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6713.08s)]
*  site. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6719.36s)]
*  It's starting to get, ah! [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6720.48s)]
*  So they're starting to do more and more targeted experiments. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6722.04s)]
*  May I ask why? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6726.88s)]
*  Why would you want to take a virus like that [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6728.04s)]
*  and make it more infectious? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6730.0s)]
*  The overarching answer is called bio defense. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6733.16s)]
*  And then the real question, which I don't know the answer to, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6738.4s)]
*  is that bio warfare? [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6743.4s)]
*  Or is that true defense? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6745.64s)]
*  NIH, starting in 2001, became the Defense Department's [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6748.72s)]
*  research unit. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6754.4s)]
*  So remember the anthrax attack that came after 9-11? [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6756.32s)]
*  Very well. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6759.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6760.5199999999995s)]
*  After that. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6761.48s)]
*  I'm sorry to ask you, Paul. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6762.08s)]
*  Are you satisfied you know what that was? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6764.2s)]
*  That probably came out of AMRID. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6767.12s)]
*  It was probably some US scientists, either provoking [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6769.16s)]
*  or doing some crazy things or disgruntled or boosting up [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6775.5599999999995s)]
*  the DOD budget. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6780.92s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6783.12s)]
*  I know that after that, DOD put its budget [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6784.8s)]
*  through Tony Fauci's unit, which suddenly became the largest [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6788.16s)]
*  unit of NIH. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6791.52s)]
*  And Fauci became the head of what is politely [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6792.6s)]
*  called bio defense. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6796.92s)]
*  But one only suspects that it is we're not [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6798.68s)]
*  supposed to do bio warfare. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6802.96s)]
*  It used to be called germ warfare. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6804.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6806.400000000001s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6807.040000000001s)]
*  And they say, well, it's for vaccines against bio warfare. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6808.320000000001s)]
*  It's to defend against it. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6812.8s)]
*  It's to defend against natural outbreaks. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6814.120000000001s)]
*  But what it is is a tremendously dangerous research [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6816.28s)]
*  program that involves a lot of manipulation [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6820.88s)]
*  of very dangerous pathogens. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6824.2s)]
*  And by 2015, the ability of scientists [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6826.719999999999s)]
*  to manipulate these viruses was reaching astounding proportions. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6830.679999999999s)]
*  And we've got a real genius who was part of this group named [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6835.84s)]
*  Ralph Barak at University of North Carolina, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6839.639999999999s)]
*  who is a genius. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6842.679999999999s)]
*  And what he could do was if you gave him [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6845.28s)]
*  30,000 letters of the DNA code, AGCCGA, and so forth, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6849.84s)]
*  and I mean, give him the letters, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6858.12s)]
*  he'll turn that into a live virus. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6860.4s)]
*  I think that's pretty damn remarkable. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6863.04s)]
*  In other words, you give him the designer virus, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6865.96s)]
*  he'll give you the live virus. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6867.88s)]
*  And he created what's called a reverse genetic system [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6870.5599999999995s)]
*  to make these viruses and to put in pieces into the viruses [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6874.68s)]
*  with a technique which he also called nocium, meaning [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6881.0s)]
*  you suture in a part, but you do it in a way [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6885.6s)]
*  that you can't identify that it was put in the lab. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6888.96s)]
*  So it's without the fingerprints, as it were. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6892.68s)]
*  And it's clear that this area of research [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6896.16s)]
*  picked up a tremendous amount of steam [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6900.52s)]
*  because a lot of American scientists [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6903.36s)]
*  were shouting, this is so damn dangerous, stop it. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6905.32s)]
*  And Fauci was saying, no, this is important. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6909.799999999999s)]
*  This is really crucial. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6913.44s)]
*  We're going to continue to do this. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6914.599999999999s)]
*  There was a brief moratorium at the end of the Obama period, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6916.44s)]
*  and then the moratorium was lifted during the Trump [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6921.679999999999s)]
*  administration. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6925.08s)]
*  And even during the moratorium period, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6926.5199999999995s)]
*  we know that the research continued on many grants. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6928.799999999999s)]
*  It's clear when you look closely at this [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6932.88s)]
*  that they were getting closer and closer [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6936.2s)]
*  to this insertion of the furan cleavage site [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6939.16s)]
*  into SARS-like viruses. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6943.52s)]
*  Now, in 2018 came this proposal. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6946.88s)]
*  As always, this was a highly classified proposal. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6951.56s)]
*  We only learned about it after the fact by a whistleblower. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6955.4400000000005s)]
*  We never even would have learned about it, [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6959.6s)]
*  even in all of the commotion of the pandemic, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6962.64s)]
*  but for a whistleblower, a brave whistleblower [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6966.56s)]
*  in the Department of Defense who said [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6970.12s)]
*  the public needs to see this. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6972.72s)]
*  And when you look at the diffuse proposal, really, you say, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6975.08s)]
*  holy shit. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6978.92s)]
*  Because on page 10, it says, we have collected more than 180 [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6980.92s)]
*  previously unreported beta coronaviruses. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6987.96s)]
*  And on page 11, it says, we're going [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6992.72s)]
*  to test them for whether they have a proteolytic cleavage [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6994.84s)]
*  site, which is a furan cleavage site. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=6998.96s)]
*  And if they don't, we're going to insert a furan cleavage [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7000.96s)]
*  site into them. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7004.64s)]
*  It's the goddamn cookbook for how to make this virus. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7006.4800000000005s)]
*  So here comes the Defense Department turned it down, [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7012.84s)]
*  supposedly. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7018.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, probably did. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7020.0s)]
*  And then comes the question, well, so what happened? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7022.2s)]
*  Well, the people that wrote that little cookbook said, not us. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7026.360000000001s)]
*  We didn't do anything like that. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7031.2s)]
*  No, it got turned down. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7033.12s)]
*  Nothing to look at here. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7034.76s)]
*  And there are all, I know, because people have told me, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7037.0s)]
*  oh, Jeff, it's not just that it got turned down. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7043.4s)]
*  They had done the work even before they [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7047.0s)]
*  submitted the grant proposal. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7049.32s)]
*  That's not uncommon in science, which is you do [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7050.76s)]
*  a lot of the work beforehand. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7053.08s)]
*  So I've heard that on good authority. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7054.6s)]
*  I can't verify it personally. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7058.36s)]
*  And there are so many strands now that say, yeah, something [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7061.4s)]
*  really screwy was going on. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7068.36s)]
*  For example, there's a very weird paper, weird to me, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7071.04s)]
*  by Barak and the head of what's called Rocky Mountain [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7075.759999999999s)]
*  Laboratory, which is a NIH laboratory under Fauci's [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7081.599999999999s)]
*  authority, that reports this completely bizarre finding. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7086.28s)]
*  And the finding sounds very technical, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7093.84s)]
*  but it says the Wuhan Institute of Virology Type 1 virus does [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7096.24s)]
*  not infect Egyptian fruit bats. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7103.0s)]
*  OK, that's the title. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7105.639999999999s)]
*  So you say, so what the hell is that? [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7107.16s)]
*  What that is is that obviously in 2019 and 2018, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7110.0s)]
*  they were doing experiments using viruses from Wuhan [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7116.6s)]
*  in the Rocky Mountain Labs with their collection of bats. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7121.0s)]
*  OK, so one theory, and the bats in Rocky Mountain Labs [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7125.48s)]
*  is called an Egyptian fruit bat. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7132.04s)]
*  It's not the kind of bat that carries [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7134.84s)]
*  this virus in China, which is in Yunnan, which [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7137.48s)]
*  is a different kind of bat. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7139.88s)]
*  But they tried it in Rocky Mountain Lab. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7141.84s)]
*  I scratched my head and said, what the hell? [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7145.24s)]
*  We have Rocky Mountain Lab doing experiments with Wuhan viruses [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7149.04s)]
*  in Montana, in NIH labs with Ralph Barak, who [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7153.4s)]
*  is one of the principal investigators of the insert [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7157.4s)]
*  the furan cleavage site into the virus. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7160.5199999999995s)]
*  I'd like to know more about that. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7162.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7164.32s)]
*  Isn't that curious? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7165.16s)]
*  Then there are other scientists that [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7167.88s)]
*  have pieces of this puzzle. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7170.12s)]
*  So the answer is we don't know exactly. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7171.92s)]
*  One theory is that it was concocted in the US [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7174.5199999999995s)]
*  and sent over to Wuhan, to this Wuhan Institute of Virology, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7177.76s)]
*  for testing in their bat collection, which [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7184.2s)]
*  is the Chinese bats rather than the Egyptian fruit bats. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7187.72s)]
*  That's plausible. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7191.4s)]
*  That's one person's theory. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7192.4s)]
*  There are other theories that even a related research group [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7194.16s)]
*  German and Dutch may have played a role because they [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7200.36s)]
*  have in Wuhan research. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7203.16s)]
*  But when the virus broke out in that period [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7205.2s)]
*  at the end of 2019, early 2020, there's [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7211.88s)]
*  commotion among the scientists. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7216.88s)]
*  What the hell is this? [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7219.36s)]
*  Where did this come from? [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7220.48s)]
*  Oh my god, did we do this? [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7221.44s)]
*  How'd this escape? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7223.72s)]
*  Or whatever. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7224.72s)]
*  Nobody knows, of course. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7225.72s)]
*  So they start having secret calls. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7227.400000000001s)]
*  And one of the most important of these calls [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7230.72s)]
*  was on February 1, 2020, that was then [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7234.96s)]
*  memorialized by one of the participants in a long memo, [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7242.16s)]
*  all of which became public through a Freedom of Information [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7246.4400000000005s)]
*  Act subsequently. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7250.4800000000005s)]
*  Because our government has lied to us [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7252.0s)]
*  about every single moment of this from the start, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7253.84s)]
*  hasn't told us anything about any of this. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7257.68s)]
*  It's all whistleblowers or Freedom of Information Act. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7259.84s)]
*  That's the only way we know any of what I'm describing to you [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7262.96s)]
*  right now. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7265.84s)]
*  No one has told the truth at all. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7266.56s)]
*  So on the February 1 call, the scientists say, oh god, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7269.56s)]
*  this looks like a lab stuff. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7276.44s)]
*  One of them says, I can't figure out [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7278.92s)]
*  how this could have ever come out of nature. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7281.32s)]
*  And they're all looking at the furin cleavage site. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7283.719999999999s)]
*  Because they know, this group of scientists [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7286.16s)]
*  knows that's the object of research. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7288.04s)]
*  That's the goal. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7289.84s)]
*  It's never been seen before in a virus like this. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7290.96s)]
*  It's the signature right there. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7294.24s)]
*  I did this. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7296.799999999999s)]
*  And four days later, that group authors [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7298.12s)]
*  the first draft of a paper called [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7306.12s)]
*  the proximal origins of SARS-CoV-2 that [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7309.96s)]
*  says it's a natural virus. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7313.96s)]
*  The same people wrote it? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7317.16s)]
*  The same people who privately said it's out of a lab, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7318.2s)]
*  most likely. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7323.0s)]
*  So it's just that is provably a cover up then. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7323.599999999999s)]
*  That's a cover up. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7326.32s)]
*  This paper is a fraud. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7327.36s)]
*  It has not been retracted until today. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7329.12s)]
*  And it's a fraud. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7332.5199999999995s)]
*  Where did it run? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7333.44s)]
*  It ran in Nature Medicine in March 2020. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7334.32s)]
*  Which I think is considered one of the most credible medical [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7337.88s)]
*  journals. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7341.16s)]
*  Right? [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7341.639999999999s)]
*  When I read it, when it came out, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7342.16s)]
*  it was I think the most cited paper in biology or in medicine [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7345.48s)]
*  by far in 2020. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7352.12s)]
*  Everyone wanted to know where this virus came from. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7353.48s)]
*  I read it. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7356.96s)]
*  And I went around knowingly telling everyone, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7358.24s)]
*  oh, it's not a, it's natural. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7361.12s)]
*  You have to read proximal origins of SARS-CoV-2. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7364.12s)]
*  Because it never occurred to you they [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7367.04s)]
*  would lie in nature medicine. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7368.12s)]
*  Because this is the top of the heap [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7369.599999999999s)]
*  of the scientific journals and the scientific establishment. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7373.5199999999995s)]
*  The top. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7377.92s)]
*  Nature. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7378.92s)]
*  There are two great science magazines [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7380.0s)]
*  in the world that have a history that is so deep. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7382.2s)]
*  One is science. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7386.2s)]
*  That's the US one. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7387.12s)]
*  And the second is nature, which is the British one. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7388.24s)]
*  And nature is the one that originally published Darwin. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7391.04s)]
*  And it's so illustrious. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7397.36s)]
*  And I was so smug. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7400.48s)]
*  Oh, you didn't read nature, SARS-CoV-2, proximal origins. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7402.92s)]
*  Because you believe that stuff when it's written there. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7407.36s)]
*  It's a fraud, that paper. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7410.12s)]
*  And it stands to this day. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7412.16s)]
*  To this day, they have not retracted it. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7413.76s)]
*  There is, last week, a call by several scientists [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7416.6s)]
*  to the editor, a very clever one, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7421.160000000001s)]
*  calling for its retraction. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7423.72s)]
*  Because this is interesting. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7425.360000000001s)]
*  All in the weeds. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7428.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's like everything we're talking about. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7429.72s)]
*  The nonstop line. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7432.200000000001s)]
*  The paper was, to an important extent, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7435.160000000001s)]
*  honchoed by somebody named Jeremy Farrar, who at the time [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7438.64s)]
*  was the director of British Welcome Trust, which [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7443.72s)]
*  is a huge foundation that supports biomedical research. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7449.0s)]
*  And Farrar was working with Fauci to make it look like nature. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7454.360000000001s)]
*  And so he was part of this group, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7461.360000000001s)]
*  but he's not a named author. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7466.2s)]
*  And at the bottom of the article, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7468.76s)]
*  this more details than you want to know. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7472.48s)]
*  But at the bottom of the article, thanks, Welcome Trust. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7474.24s)]
*  Well, under the rules of science and under the rules [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7477.36s)]
*  of a journal, if there's a contributor who [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7480.24s)]
*  financed the thing but is not mentioned as a contributor [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7485.12s)]
*  to the article, that is, per se, a violation [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7488.4s)]
*  of conflict of interest standards. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7492.719999999999s)]
*  And that wasn't revealed. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7497.12s)]
*  So just last week, a group of very illustrious virologists [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7498.64s)]
*  called for the retraction of this. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7503.68s)]
*  I've called for the retraction of it [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7506.8s)]
*  because it's an outright fraud. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7508.6s)]
*  Because we have slack messages and other email messages [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7510.0s)]
*  and other e-messaging that says, I don't really believe this. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7514.320000000001s)]
*  Or in other words, it's clearly a fraudulent paper. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7521.280000000001s)]
*  But they're not moving to this moment. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7528.2s)]
*  So there's a lot of debate about a pandemic treaty. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7533.08s)]
*  WHO is, of course, pushing it. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7536.599999999999s)]
*  Lots of countries are as well, as you well know. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7539.04s)]
*  How can you prepare for a new pandemic [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7542.88s)]
*  without establishing the origin of the most recent pandemic? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7546.44s)]
*  And more than that, we're going to have another pandemic [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7550.2s)]
*  if it came out of a lab. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7552.679999999999s)]
*  They're still doing this work. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7553.72s)]
*  It's not as if they said, oh, my god, we really blew it. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7555.52s)]
*  Now we stop gain-of-function research. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7560.160000000001s)]
*  There's gain-of-function research going on [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7562.080000000001s)]
*  all over the place. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7563.92s)]
*  And then interestingly, Tucker, last year, almost like Monty [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7565.6s)]
*  Python, but it's so serious, Boston University [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7572.88s)]
*  put out a paper based on gain-of-function [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7577.92s)]
*  for manipulating SARS-CoV-2. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7581.32s)]
*  And NIH says, you didn't ask for approval [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7586.32s)]
*  before doing that experiment. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7592.599999999999s)]
*  And Boston University says, we don't [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7594.84s)]
*  have to ask for approval. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7597.679999999999s)]
*  It's not on your grant. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7599.2s)]
*  We just were doing it like we want. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7600.639999999999s)]
*  And it shows we got a shit show going on in this country [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7603.4s)]
*  right now. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7606.84s)]
*  If a university thinks it can do whatever it wants [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7607.719999999999s)]
*  and if NIH has a different opinion and we have no rules [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7611.12s)]
*  and they're doing work on dangerous pathogens, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7615.28s)]
*  yeah, we're going to have another pandemic. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7618.4s)]
*  Even if this one didn't come from it, [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7621.5199999999995s)]
*  this line of work is really dangerous. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7624.4s)]
*  And who's watching it? [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7628.44s)]
*  Well, we don't know because it's DOD, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7630.2s)]
*  because it's confidential, because no one tells us [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7633.84s)]
*  anything. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7636.76s)]
*  And interestingly, now the House investigation committee [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7637.88s)]
*  is trying to get at some of this. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7643.8s)]
*  The Democrats completely surrounded Fauci [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7646.36s)]
*  and said, we don't want to have a look at this. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7650.12s)]
*  And said, this is Republican grandstanding. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7652.68s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7655.84s)]
*  What could be less partisan than where this virus came from? [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7657.12s)]
*  And we can't even get Democrats in the House. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7661.96s)]
*  Now I think a few of them are coming along. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7666.04s)]
*  But for a time, it was completely partisan. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7668.96s)]
*  The Republicans could investigate in the House, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7672.92s)]
*  but in the Senate where the Democrats are controlled, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7675.6s)]
*  they were saying no. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7678.0s)]
*  And Rand Paul asked me to come in and meet his counterpart, who [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7679.44s)]
*  was the chair of the committee, Peters. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7685.28s)]
*  And I did. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7688.08s)]
*  And now, by the way, they are moving in the Senate [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7689.12s)]
*  because you got these bright red lights flashing. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7693.16s)]
*  Holy hell, let's find out what happened. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7696.8s)]
*  Is it strange to wake up one day and all of a sudden [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7699.68s)]
*  see actual threats to the existence of humanity [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7705.04s)]
*  right there, nuclear war, bio warfare, possibly AI? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7708.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7715.76s)]
*  But just right there. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7717.2s)]
*  I mean, what big picture, what is this? [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7719.12s)]
*  Did you ever think you would, after living [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7721.96s)]
*  in the most prosperous country in the world your entire life, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7725.16s)]
*  find yourself in a place where the country you live in [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7728.4800000000005s)]
*  is basically causing the potential extinction [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7730.72s)]
*  of humanity? [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7736.72s)]
*  I think it's really true and important to understand [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7739.72s)]
*  that since 1945, we've been living this way. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7744.56s)]
*  And we don't know it. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7749.88s)]
*  We're barely aware of it. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7751.76s)]
*  But the ability to screw things up in this world is very high. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7754.360000000001s)]
*  The ability to have terrible accidents, oops, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7759.280000000001s)]
*  where'd that virus come from? [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7762.68s)]
*  The ability to have a nuclear war even by accident, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7764.84s)]
*  but much less when you're in the face of your opponent [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7770.400000000001s)]
*  and talking about defeating them and so forth, [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7774.72s)]
*  a war between two nuclear superpowers [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7777.64s)]
*  that we have normalized. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7780.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're not at war. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7783.0s)]
*  We're just feeding them all the weapons. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7784.68s)]
*  And the British, who are the worst at this, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7787.36s)]
*  yeah, they can use the weapons wherever they want. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7789.32s)]
*  No constraint, no control. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7792.76s)]
*  We've been living this way. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7795.28s)]
*  But we don't know it because, like everything else, [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7797.8s)]
*  the narrative doesn't permit it. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7802.24s)]
*  One day, Biden said in, I think it was the fall of 2022, [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7806.4s)]
*  this is pretty dangerous. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7815.96s)]
*  We could be on a path to nuclear armageddon. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7817.24s)]
*  He didn't say that in a speech to the American people [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7820.12s)]
*  because he doesn't give speeches to the American people. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7822.599999999999s)]
*  He doesn't talk to the American people. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7825.12s)]
*  He doesn't have press conferences. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7826.799999999999s)]
*  He said it at some fundraiser, as usual. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7829.5199999999995s)]
*  And then someone reported it. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7832.36s)]
*  What was the reaction of the press the next day? [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7834.44s)]
*  Almost to a paper, the reaction was, [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7837.639999999999s)]
*  how dare he say these things? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7841.5599999999995s)]
*  How dare he scare the people? [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7843.24s)]
*  How dare he say a word like armageddon? [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7844.799999999999s)]
*  There was, I think, an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7847.799999999999s)]
*  if I remember correctly, that this unforgivable, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7850.12s)]
*  this kind of slip of the president of the United States. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7852.839999999999s)]
*  So Biden, for a moment, blurted out the truth, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7855.839999999999s)]
*  no doubt by accident, no doubt because he [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7860.879999999999s)]
*  was in some fundraiser, probably trying [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7863.04s)]
*  to impress some donor. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7865.16s)]
*  But the reaction wasn't, oh my god, what does this mean? [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7867.36s)]
*  How do we consider this? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7872.08s)]
*  Let's go back and think about unprovoked, unprovoked, [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7873.76s)]
*  unprovoked, and maybe we could decide [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7876.44s)]
*  how to step a little bit back from the cliff. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7878.56s)]
*  And no, absolutely the opposite, completely the opposite. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7882.12s)]
*  And I've seen, I mean, not only you [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7888.84s)]
*  could have a pandemic that kills an estimated 20 million people [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7892.52s)]
*  and not really care to find out where it came from, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7895.96s)]
*  you can be on the brink of nuclear war. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7898.200000000001s)]
*  We can have Ukraine shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7900.360000000001s)]
*  plant. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7903.8s)]
*  Do you know, our newspapers won't [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7904.280000000001s)]
*  say that it's Ukraine shelling the power plant. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7906.200000000001s)]
*  And Ukraine is shelling the nuclear power plant. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7910.92s)]
*  I can reveal as if it's a surprise, [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7913.280000000001s)]
*  because the Russians are inside the power plant [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7917.68s)]
*  and the Ukrainians are trying to take back the power plant. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7920.0s)]
*  And so these shells come to the nuclear power plant. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7923.56s)]
*  And then our lovely newspapers say, [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7926.92s)]
*  each side accuses the other of shelling the nuclear power [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7932.08s)]
*  plant. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7935.44s)]
*  And I happen to know for the reasons [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7936.52s)]
*  that I know some of these things that, of course, [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7939.76s)]
*  it's Ukraine shelling a plant that the Russians are inside [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7943.88s)]
*  not Russians shelling the plant. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7948.120000000001s)]
*  But you can't get officialdom to say this. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7950.96s)]
*  You can't get the newspapers to say this. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7955.0s)]
*  That's pretty serious to be shelling a nuclear power plant. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7957.64s)]
*  I mean, are you out of your, I put that on the list [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7961.64s)]
*  that we've been adding to. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7965.120000000001s)]
*  Are you out of your mind? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7966.56s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7968.52s)]
*  But they're doing it. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7970.120000000001s)]
*  In the country in the world, there's [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7971.280000000001s)]
*  actually had a profound nuclear accident already. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7972.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7974.8s)]
*  I might mention that maybe they would know something about it, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7975.3s)]
*  that there would be some reticence about shelling. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7978.14s)]
*  So that leads to my last sincere question, which you may [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7980.3s)]
*  or may not answer. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7983.58s)]
*  But you're telling the truth about things that are big. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7984.38s)]
*  There are big things, the biggest things. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7988.62s)]
*  And in a world where you're just absolutely, [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7991.58s)]
*  as you've noted repeatedly and correctly, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7993.54s)]
*  you're just not allowed to do that. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7995.34s)]
*  And you're telling the truth about people [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7997.22s)]
*  who don't care about the deaths of millions, who have caused [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=7999.22s)]
*  the deaths of millions. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8001.62s)]
*  So are you worried because you do have credibility, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8003.22s)]
*  you're not a crank, and your job and your career [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8006.46s)]
*  give you prima facie credibility, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8009.06s)]
*  it's a big thing for you to say these things. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8011.22s)]
*  Are you worried about the risks to you? [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8013.14s)]
*  Really? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8015.22s)]
*  I'm worried about the risks to me of a nuclear war. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8017.18s)]
*  For sure. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8020.58s)]
*  I really am. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8021.18s)]
*  I spend a lot of time with diplomats. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8023.54s)]
*  I really like diplomats, by the way. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8027.46s)]
*  Even when countries hate each other or war, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8030.820000000001s)]
*  good diplomats smile and talk to each other. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8035.1s)]
*  And one could say, oh, how cynical. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8037.860000000001s)]
*  But it's actually quite nice. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8041.18s)]
*  I believe the human touch is what can keep us alive, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8042.860000000001s)]
*  actually. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8046.22s)]
*  I don't think it's a naive idea. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8046.700000000001s)]
*  It's actually a quite deep idea. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8049.26s)]
*  Russia has one of the greatest diplomats I've ever seen. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8052.06s)]
*  I think Lavrov is absolutely remarkable. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8054.860000000001s)]
*  Remarkable. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8057.38s)]
*  And I've known him for 30 years. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8057.900000000001s)]
*  Have you, really? [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8059.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8060.26s)]
*  It's funny, in a fair world, in an American world, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8061.0199999999995s)]
*  he'd be very famous. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8063.62s)]
*  Even if he disagreed with everything he said, [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8064.7s)]
*  because he's so obviously smart. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8066.66s)]
*  He's astoundingly smart and astoundingly capable. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8068.42s)]
*  And he's astoundingly someone that we [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8073.94s)]
*  should be speaking with to find an answer to this. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8079.3s)]
*  So the thing that makes it, if I were [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8083.54s)]
*  shouting in the wilderness and just felt, it's insane, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8088.66s)]
*  no one's listening, I'd have a very different reaction [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8093.22s)]
*  from the one that I actually carry day by day. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8096.74s)]
*  Almost everyone I talk to around the world is worried, [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8100.7s)]
*  shares the things we're talking about, understands the risks, [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8106.0199999999995s)]
*  makes you feel completely normal, not abnormal, [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8111.139999999999s)]
*  in any of this, says, please keep doing this. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8114.9s)]
*  Can you find a way to talk here or there? [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8118.42s)]
*  I've spoken twice in the UN Security Council [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8121.14s)]
*  or testified twice in the UN Security Council [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8123.62s)]
*  in the last two years. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8125.9800000000005s)]
*  I want to make the diplomacy work, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8127.9s)]
*  because our lives depend on it. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8131.54s)]
*  And we stopped all diplomacy in the United States, all of it, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8134.1s)]
*  except what we call speaking with our friends and allies. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8141.1s)]
*  But diplomacy is not speaking with your friends and allies. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8145.26s)]
*  Diplomacy is speaking with your counterparts, [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8149.34s)]
*  even your adversaries. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8152.26s)]
*  That's what diplomacy is, and we've got to get it back. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8154.18s)]
*  Do you think the average American, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8157.34s)]
*  I said that was my last question, but I do have one more. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8158.860000000001s)]
*  Do you think the average American, even sort of [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8161.46s)]
*  informed people, has any sense at all of how close we [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8163.820000000001s)]
*  are to annihilation? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8166.74s)]
*  I think people are worried, and people are not [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8168.820000000001s)]
*  happy campers, and people do not agree [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8174.74s)]
*  with the foreign policy of this administration. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8177.74s)]
*  But people are also very confused, [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8181.58s)]
*  because we don't hear anything clear, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8184.0599999999995s)]
*  except when you interview President Putin, [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8187.219999999999s)]
*  and we get to hear what he says. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8190.139999999999s)]
*  And think of, I mean, that was a monumental occasion, Tucker, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8192.34s)]
*  and an extraordinarily important one. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8198.14s)]
*  But how rare it is, and that's what [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8200.94s)]
*  made it also so extraordinary, because you're not [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8203.06s)]
*  supposed to do that. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8206.34s)]
*  We're not supposed to listen to that. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8207.26s)]
*  So I think Americans, they know that something's wrong. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8209.42s)]
*  They don't know exactly how could they [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8216.18s)]
*  know what exactly is wrong. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8218.46s)]
*  The level of trust in government is extraordinarily low. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8221.699999999999s)]
*  That low trust has been, unfortunately, [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8225.34s)]
*  amply deserved, because our government lies, and lies, [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8229.26s)]
*  and lies. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8232.26s)]
*  And it doesn't even try to tell the truth anymore. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8232.86s)]
*  It tries to make a narrative. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8235.42s)]
*  So I think people sense something seriously wrong. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8237.78s)]
*  But God, I hope our lives are in the hands of a few people. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8244.7s)]
*  And they better learn some prudence, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8250.220000000001s)]
*  because they have not had it for a long time. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8253.060000000001s)]
*  And they don't even understand what [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8256.26s)]
*  it is to talk to a counterpart. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8258.18s)]
*  And my absolute core bottom line is, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8259.9s)]
*  until Biden speaks directly with Putin and starts talking, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8267.38s)]
*  our lives are deeply at risk. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8271.98s)]
*  And it's unimaginable to me that we are in open war as we are, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8274.74s)]
*  and we're not even trying to find the path to peace [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8281.18s)]
*  right now. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8284.14s)]
*  And we have crazy statements that the president of Finland [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8285.14s)]
*  said, the path to peace is through the battlefield. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8290.099999999999s)]
*  These people don't understand anything. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8295.3s)]
*  And I was just going to mention two quick things in closing. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8299.859999999999s)]
*  One, I spent a lot of my life studying the Cuban missile [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8305.099999999999s)]
*  crisis and its aftermath. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8309.18s)]
*  And I wrote a book about Kennedy's peace initiative [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8311.06s)]
*  in 1963, which was remarkable, because he actually, [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8314.74s)]
*  in the height of the Cold War, reached the partial nuclear [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8320.619999999999s)]
*  test ban treaty with Khrushchev. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8324.22s)]
*  And they both knew we had to pull back from the brink, [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8325.78s)]
*  because they both had had advisors that would have led us [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8328.9s)]
*  to nuclear annihilation. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8331.58s)]
*  And they were just completely, completely shocked [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8332.9s)]
*  as the two people who had saved the world, but just barely, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8336.699999999999s)]
*  how close we had come. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8340.82s)]
*  But one of the things that most people don't know [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8342.62s)]
*  about the Cuban missile crisis is [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8345.26s)]
*  that even when Kennedy and Khrushchev had reached [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8347.02s)]
*  an agreement, we almost had nuclear war after that event [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8350.220000000001s)]
*  because of the disabled Soviet submarine. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8355.86s)]
*  Do you know this event? [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8358.54s)]
*  No. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8360.060000000001s)]
*  It's one of the most remarkable, little-known facts [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8361.5s)]
*  of modern history. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8366.58s)]
*  And it's worth understanding. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8369.34s)]
*  After Kennedy and Khrushchev reached the agreement [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8372.54s)]
*  to end the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8375.7s)]
*  removing the nuclear weapons from Turkey, [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8379.34s)]
*  and Soviet Union removing the nuclear weapons from Cuba, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8382.62s)]
*  and the US promising never again to try to invade Cuba, [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8386.62s)]
*  there was a disabled Soviet sub at the bottom of the Caribbean [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8392.54s)]
*  that had been sent over during the crisis. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8398.140000000001s)]
*  And it blew a gasket, as it were, [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8401.02s)]
*  and temperatures inside 120 degrees, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8403.94s)]
*  and the sailors fainting, and the ship deeply disabled. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8407.5s)]
*  And this was 1962, so the communications did not exist. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8413.86s)]
*  The ship was out of communication. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8418.34s)]
*  They had no idea what was going on. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8419.82s)]
*  So they decided to surface. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8422.140000000001s)]
*  And as they surfaced, American Navy pilots [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8424.26s)]
*  were dropping charges on the sub. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8429.02s)]
*  And it's not absolutely sure, but one story [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8432.34s)]
*  is that one Navy pilot for fun was dropping live grenades [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8437.140000000001s)]
*  on the sub as it was surfacing rather than depth charges. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8445.62s)]
*  And the pilot thought that they were under attack [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8450.9s)]
*  and that there was a war above the surface. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8454.9s)]
*  Now, this was the lead sub of a squadron of seven [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8457.94s)]
*  in the Caribbean. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8462.5s)]
*  And it was the one sub in that squadron [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8463.82s)]
*  that had nuclear-tipped torpedoes. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8466.54s)]
*  And under US doctrine, any attack by a nuclear weapon [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8471.78s)]
*  was to be met by the full force of the US nuclear arsenal [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8477.1s)]
*  with an attack across the Soviet Union, China, and all [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8482.02s)]
*  of the Eastern European countries, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8486.54s)]
*  estimate 700 million dead. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8488.7s)]
*  And that was to happen with any nuclear attack. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8491.7s)]
*  And Curtis LeMay was the head of the US Air Force at the time, [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8494.5s)]
*  and he couldn't wait. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8499.94s)]
*  I think it's fair to say. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8501.42s)]
*  Yes, it's fair to say. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8503.18s)]
*  So what happened was this skipper, [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8504.300000000001s)]
*  the commander of the vessel, ordered the nuclear torpedo [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8510.980000000001s)]
*  into the Torpedo Bay to be fired because he thought [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8516.14s)]
*  the ship was under attack. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8519.42s)]
*  And by miracle, a guy named Arkhipov, [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8522.14s)]
*  who was the person who saved the world whose name nobody knows, [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8527.099999999999s)]
*  and I'm pretty sure I have the name right, [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8532.82s)]
*  was a party official that had a higher rank than the ship's [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8536.42s)]
*  captain and said, I don't think that's a good idea. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8544.1s)]
*  I think we should surface. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8547.460000000001s)]
*  And he countermanded the order at the last moment, [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8549.300000000001s)]
*  and the ship surfaced, and they found out [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8553.42s)]
*  there was no war and no crisis, and that was the end of it. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8555.9s)]
*  And we came within a moment of a full nuclear annihilation. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8560.42s)]
*  Now, that's a true story. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8567.98s)]
*  If people want to read about it in detail, [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8570.140000000001s)]
*  the most remarkable book about this [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8572.38s)]
*  is a book by the late historian Martin Sherwin called [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8575.259999999998s)]
*  Gambling with Armageddon, which is an absolutely phenomenal [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8578.98s)]
*  work. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8583.539999999999s)]
*  And Martin Sherwin, as some people may recall, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8584.259999999998s)]
*  is the historian who's the co-author of Oppenheimer, [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8586.779999999999s)]
*  which became the screenplay. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8589.539999999999s)]
*  He's a wonderful historian who died a few years ago. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8591.539999999999s)]
*  And he tells this story in unbelievable, riveting detail. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8594.98s)]
*  Now, I take this not only as a literal event, [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8602.46s)]
*  but as a metaphor for our reality, which is something [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8607.18s)]
*  can always go wrong. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8612.22s)]
*  Stay away from the cliff. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8614.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8616.58s)]
*  Stay away from the cliff. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8617.3s)]
*  This is how close we are. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8620.34s)]
*  Talk to President Putin. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8622.54s)]
*  Negotiate with China. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8625.660000000002s)]
*  Make a two-state solution to stop the war in the Middle [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8627.980000000001s)]
*  East. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8632.34s)]
*  Stop carrying on like you run the world because you don't. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8632.94s)]
*  Thank you for this. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-3QssVPeg&t=8639.62s)]
