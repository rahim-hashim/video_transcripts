# Andrey Melnichenko (One of Russia’s Richest Men) on Nuclear War and Why Biden Wants to Destroy Him
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8)
*  The US government is now orchestrating a bombing campaign within Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, the United States is in a hot war with Russia because the president was just convicted, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3.84s)]
*  former President Trump. But there's a lot going on in the US. They're both nuclear armed powers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=8.16s)]
*  What are the chances that this becomes a nuclear exchange? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=12.4s)]
*  For now, I don't see forces which is seriously waking to de-escalation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=14.96s)]
*  Do you think Trump is capable of stopping this trajectory of escalation? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=19.2s)]
*  How many countries are you banned from visiting? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  European Union, UK, Switzerland, Canada, United States, New Zealand, Australia, Japan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=26.56s)]
*  Japan? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=34.0s)]
*  To be honest, I'm not sure about Japan. I need to check. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=36.16s)]
*  Why do you think taking Putin out as president of Russia became the number one objective of the US [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=40.08s)]
*  government? I think it's pretty straightforward. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=45.2s)]
*  Climate protesters in Europe have been destroying, in Renaissance paintings, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  in the name of ending climate change. How do you get from a concern about global [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=51.92s)]
*  temperatures to destroying art? What is that? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=55.92s)]
*  Andre, thank you for coming. We had dinner this winter in the Middle East. It was one [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=68.56s)]
*  of the most interesting dinners I've ever had in my long life. We've been texting ever since. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=83.92s)]
*  I wanted to set down some of that conversation on tape because I thought people would be [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=89.04s)]
*  edified to hear it. I knew that you were on the sanctions list for some reason. I didn't [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=94.0s)]
*  understand why. I still don't understand why. But we are now in El Salvador because we couldn't [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  meet anywhere else. We couldn't meet in the EU. We couldn't meet anywhere in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=105.76s)]
*  Anglosphere. We couldn't even meet in Switzerland, which has given up its sovereignty to NATO [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=108.56s)]
*  somehow. We're meeting here, very far from where you live. Tell us who you are and how [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=112.64000000000001s)]
*  you wound up on the sanctions list. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=120.0s)]
*  So you are what you are described in the US press as an oligarch. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=150.8s)]
*  Oligarchs, at least to my understanding, were people who, as the Soviet Union collapsed in 91, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=171.12s)]
*  grabbed state industries because they had inside connections and they killed people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=177.44s)]
*  But I think you were a teenager when the Soviet Union collapsed, correct? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=182.08s)]
*  So most interesting, it was a bank. I received a banking license when I was 21 years old. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  A little bit later, this bank grew, became one of the biggest banks in Russia, biggest private [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=213.84s)]
*  banks in Russia. And I sold it in 2017. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=218.96s)]
*  And then you went into the fertilizer business. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  During the 90s, my bank did not participate in anything that you're referring to. So we [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=226.56s)]
*  did not participate in privatization. We did not grab basically government assets. So we grew up [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=232.72s)]
*  like a market institution. So that was only what I did during the 90s. In the beginning of 2000s, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=238.32s)]
*  I started to be interested in the industrial businesses also. But again, we did not participate [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=244.32s)]
*  in privatization. We bought it mostly from the secondary market, from people who bought it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=249.6s)]
*  during the middle 90s. So why I did not participate in privatization? Very simple. I was 23, 24 years [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=255.52s)]
*  old. I did not have resources and this opportunity passed. So you're you are self-made? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=262.32s)]
*  I'm definitely self-made. So then 2022 arrives and Russian troops move across the border into [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=269.2s)]
*  eastern Ukraine. You are not working for the Russian government. I don't even know if you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=278.4s)]
*  live in Russia at this point. You're not a political figure. You don't have an elect to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  do anything. You're not a close friend of Putin's. You don't seem to have anything to do with the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=285.6s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine. Is that fair? Definitely. I have nothing to do with invasion in Ukraine. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=288.8s)]
*  That's absolutely true. So from an American perspective, we read that the US government [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=295.12s)]
*  is seizing Russian assets and we imagine these are state assets. I'm opposed to it anyway, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=301.92s)]
*  because I think it's bad for the United States. But the story that we are told is that these are [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  Russian assets, but your assets are not Russian assets. They're your assets. Is that correct? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay. So what happened with me in 2022, certain Western countries start to impose [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  sanctions on me. What does it mean? What does the sanction mean in general? The sanction means that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  your assets are basically arrested and as a result there is also a risk of confiscation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=327.04s)]
*  After that, any businesses or any companies to which you are connected, if they have an operation [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  in the West, this operation basically cannot be performed going further. So you cannot do business [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=340.56s)]
*  in the Western countries which apply sanctions. And so I am banned from the visits in Western [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=345.68s)]
*  countries. Is that what the sanction means? Answering your questions, there are different [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=350.16s)]
*  types of sanctions. There are economic sanctions. So usually the sanctions are applicable either [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=354.64s)]
*  towards some states, like for example against government or against state central banks or [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=359.44s)]
*  whatever. There are sanctions which are targeted at the economic sector. For example, oil or gas [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=364.16s)]
*  industry or some other sectors which are bringing to certain government revenue. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  After that, there are sanctions which are targeting companies. So all of these sanctions [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=375.68s)]
*  have a meaning, a purpose to basically weaken the economy base of your adversary. That is a little [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=379.44s)]
*  bit understandable. There are, after that, personal sanctions. It's slightly different. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=385.52s)]
*  Usually the sanctions are targeting individuals, people. So for example, they will target politicians [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=390.24s)]
*  or government officials or people who do certain kinds of promoting violence, etc. So that's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=395.52s)]
*  understandable. So the purpose of this sanction is that people change their behavior. They stop to do [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=403.04s)]
*  what they are doing. So that is the purpose of this sanction. And there is a third type of the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  sanction. These sanctions are applicable not because you did something bad. They are applicable [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=413.36s)]
*  because of who you are. So that's how it works. They are applicable to a certain class of the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=418.56s)]
*  people. In my case, I was sanctioned not because I did something bad. I was sanctioned because of who [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=422.72s)]
*  I am. And I'm wealthy Russian. That's why I was sanctioned. You're familiar with the phrase [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=427.76s)]
*  due process. It's part of the Anglo-Saxon, the basis of our legal code in the United States and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=433.68s)]
*  in Great Britain and other enlightened countries. And the idea is that you cannot be punished until [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  you are proved to have done something, until you're guilty. Was there a process that you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=445.28s)]
*  participated in before your assets were taken? Okay. So there are two different legal systems. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=449.68s)]
*  European one and American one. Yes. In European one, they're done in the most simple way. They [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=457.2s)]
*  say that there is a criteria which allows them to sanction anyone who is going under this criteria. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=462.08s)]
*  The criteria is very simple. It's called a leading business person. So if you're a leading business [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=467.36s)]
*  person, it means a wealthy person who is doing well, what otherwise it can mean. So that is [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  already a good enough criteria to put a sanction on you. After that, full discretion is given to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  authorities. So it's not necessary that each and every leading business person will be sanctioned, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=484.0s)]
*  but authority have a discretion to decide with whom to do it, with whom not to do it. So first [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=488.96s)]
*  question is, of course, looks like people not equal in terms of the law. So because that's a [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=494.96s)]
*  process which is basically unclear. It's not clear criteria. In United States, probably such [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=500.72s)]
*  simple criteria like to sanction business person would not be explainable to the society. At the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=509.04s)]
*  end of the day, it's not, it's so un-American. It just cannot be like this. That's why in United States, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=514.16s)]
*  other criteria is used. For example, in United States, I was sanctioned in August 2022 because [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=520.08s)]
*  of my participation in financial sectors. That's it. So that was a reason of my sanctioning. Yes, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=526.32s)]
*  it's true. I have been participating in financial services. In the age of 21 years old, I created [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=532.24s)]
*  bank together with my partner from the Physics University. So this bank had initial capital about, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=538.64s)]
*  I don't know, $50,000 at this moment. When I sold it in 2017, the value of this bank was about $3.5 [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=545.28s)]
*  billion. Buyers was most respected Western institution. For example, AFC, part of the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=552.8s)]
*  World Bank group and a number of other first class investors. So after that, I never participated in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=558.4s)]
*  any financial services. So I'm sorry, I said 2017. It was 2007. It means I have not participated in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=565.04s)]
*  financial services 14 years before sanctions were implied for me. That's it. So that's the official [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=573.68s)]
*  reason of my sanction. So what does it mean? It means, of course, it's formality. American law [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=579.92s)]
*  give possibility to the administration to again use their discretion, but they need to follow [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=587.12s)]
*  certain rules. So if you're in financial services, they can sanction you. I have been in financial [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=592.32s)]
*  services 14 years ago. If any reason to sanction for this, I don't see why. That's why I think [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=598.08s)]
*  that's in reality, it's same like in Europe. I was sanctioned not because I did something. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  I was sanctioned because who I am. And we should be clear about what sanction means in this case. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=608.24s)]
*  It's not simply that you're not allowed to do business in this or that place or you can't [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=613.0400000000001s)]
*  travel to this or that country. They stole your personal property. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=617.12s)]
*  For now, they seize my property. Okay. For now. What's the difference between seizing and stealing? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=622.0s)]
*  Since you cannot touch it, you cannot use it. You cannot basically it's blocked. If you have money [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  on account, they block on account. If you have private house, basically you cannot go in your [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=632.48s)]
*  house. That's more or less like this. How much, what's the, would you estimate the value of the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=637.04s)]
*  assets of yours, personal assets that they seized? A couple of billion dollars. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=642.48s)]
*  A couple of billion dollars. And there was no trial? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=647.04s)]
*  It's a good question. So this sanction, how I said, they applicable not because you did something bad, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=653.2s)]
*  but because who you are. Basically they applicable to the class of people. So what kind of trial it [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=659.2s)]
*  can be. So now you can go and say, I'm not a Russian business person or I'm a Russian business [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=664.48s)]
*  person. That's kind of the trial. So basically power was given to authority to use just this [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=671.52s)]
*  criteria. They don't need to justify that you did something bad. So you're just a kulak and that's [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=677.68s)]
*  it. You're in the wrong class of people. You're in the wrong class of people. Of course you can [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=683.12s)]
*  challenge it. You said about due process. Of course, this concept is very familiar to me. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  In United States, it's the fifth amendment to the American constitution. Yes. And basically question [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=693.36s)]
*  is about if the rights and privileges of the fifth amendment to the United States constitutions [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=698.16s)]
*  are applicable to me or not or to other people. Normally in United States, it will be unusual [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=704.8s)]
*  that people can be basically not allow access to the due process because they belong to the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=710.64s)]
*  certain class, be it race, be it wealth, be it something else. But in our case, situation is [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=717.52s)]
*  exactly like this. Are you going to get your assets back? I hope so. Who decides? Who decides? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=723.36s)]
*  I guess it's a political decision. So on the certain moment, one way or another situation will [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  change and rules about sanction, I hope, will also follow this kind of changes. So you were not, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=739.36s)]
*  as you said, in financial services anymore and haven't been, haven't owned a bank since 2007, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=746.96s)]
*  long before any of this began, seven years before 2014. But you do own one of the world's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=752.0s)]
*  biggest fertilizer companies. Is that correct? Again, it's a little bit more complicated. But [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=757.6s)]
*  yes, the company which manages assets on behalf of my family, it's own couple of the companies. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=764.8s)]
*  One of them is Eurechim, one of the biggest world fertilizer company. That's company which supply to [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=773.2s)]
*  the market about, I don't know, 7% of the global trade in the fertilizer. So it's pretty big company. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=778.88s)]
*  7% of all global fertilizer? Something like this in the whole trade because a lot of domestic [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=784.24s)]
*  consumption. But in the trade, it's something about this. And of course, sanction against me [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=789.12s)]
*  affect this company's big deal. But you, I mean, it's one thing to shut down a global arms dealer, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=794.56s)]
*  but to try and punish a global fertilizer dealer when fertilizer provides food that people need [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=801.2s)]
*  to live, that does seem, maybe that's not the person you want to sanction. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=806.8s)]
*  Once again, so sanction, how they work in the beginning, they were done in the hurry, in the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=812.0s)]
*  stress. I don't think that authority which use this tool look very carefully for the consequences, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=818.0s)]
*  what may happen in which case, especially it's applicable to the situation of this sanction, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  which is how you can call them, class sanction. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=831.04s)]
*  Collective punishment, we call it. Collective punishment for the rich people. So [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=836.0s)]
*  because it's very difficult to predict who, if you touch this, what else will be touched? What [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=839.8399999999999s)]
*  happened in the fertilizing sector? Has anyone ever accused you formally of doing anything wrong? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=845.8399999999999s)]
*  Never. Anything? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=851.36s)]
*  Never. So you are innocent of any crimes. No one's even accusing you of crimes. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=853.52s)]
*  But they stole billions of dollars worth of your assets. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=861.12s)]
*  I consider myself a collateral damage of the bigger conflict. I don't think it was anything personal. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  But what does that make you think of the system that did that? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=872.16s)]
*  System was not ready for this type of the actions. Actually, if I may return a step [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  before about fertilizer, what really happened? So mostly it was European problem, because European [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=883.68s)]
*  Union use, like I said, effect that somebody is a leading business person, a wealthy businessman, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=889.84s)]
*  like a criteria for sanction. In order to say this, they need to explain how exactly, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=895.84s)]
*  what exactly your wealth is. In the case of mine, and in the case of some other owners of [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=901.6s)]
*  fertilizer company, it's become connected. Basically, my wealth is a fertilizer company. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=906.88s)]
*  It means I'm connected with the fertilizer. So that's a justification to put me in the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=912.1600000000001s)]
*  category of the leading business person. But at the same time, how interesting it works. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=916.8s)]
*  So if I'm connected with whatever company, the operation of this company must be blocked [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=921.52s)]
*  in the European system in this way. So Russia and Belarus totally supply about 22% of the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  fertilizer to the world market. So the situation which happened to me happened with other owners [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=932.7199999999999s)]
*  of Russian fertilizer company. What was the result of it? The result was predictable. In 2022, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=937.5999999999999s)]
*  during about 11 months, 12 months after sanctions were applied, supply on the world market [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  was dropping about 18 million tons. It's a huge number. So that was the only reason for the drop [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  of the supply was a personal sanction. It's well studied, it's reported. So that's basically what's [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=957.12s)]
*  happened. Well, people are if really, so, I mean, you will cause famines if you do something like [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=962.6400000000001s)]
*  that, won't you? That's exactly what happened. You may have come to the obvious conclusion that [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=969.76s)]
*  the real debate is not between Republican and Democrat or socialist and capitalist, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=975.3599999999999s)]
*  right, left. The real battles between people who are lying on purpose and people who are trying to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=980.88s)]
*  tell you the truth. It's between good and evil. It's between honesty and falsehood. And we hope [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=987.52s)]
*  we are on the former side. That's why we created this network, the Tucker Carlson Network. And we [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=993.92s)]
*  invite you to subscribe to it. Go to tuckercarlson.com slash podcast. Our entire archive is there a lot of [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=998.8s)]
*  behind the scenes footage of what actually happens in this barn when only an iPhone is running. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1005.12s)]
*  tuckercarlson.com slash podcast. You will not regret it. So when 20% of the world market [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1010.4s)]
*  disappear, actually not 20% disappear because only supply which went through the Europe means [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  through the European ports or other means where Europe had control. This part of supply disappear [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1025.04s)]
*  from the world market. What happened like a result? Prices of the fertilizer shot up. So about three [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1030.8799999999999s)]
*  times during 2022. So it's let's say from average $300, we start to experience prices about $900. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1037.28s)]
*  What happened like a result? Basically, demand dropped. So farmers did not have money to buy [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1044.0s)]
*  fertilizers. But what kind of farmers it's where it was disproportionately farmers from the poor [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1049.76s)]
*  countries, because in the rich countries, our governments will help to the farmers, they will [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1054.8s)]
*  give subsidies or something else. Also consumers are ready to pay more for production produced by [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1059.76s)]
*  these farmers. But that is not the case in the poor countries. Governments don't have means to help [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1064.48s)]
*  farmers. And otherwise, consumers not ready to pay because they don't have enough income, enough [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1069.84s)]
*  possibility to do it. So mostly, this proportional effect of the sanction was felt on the poor [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1077.04s)]
*  countries of Africa, some countries of Latin America, some countries of Asia. So that's where [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1084.48s)]
*  supply of fertilizer drop. Now think about it. So these countries poor, they mostly they're not able [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1090.24s)]
*  to substitute domestic production of agro foods by import. Why? Because it's much more expensive. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1097.92s)]
*  So it's much cheaper to import fertilizer and grow products domestically, rather than import [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1105.92s)]
*  grains or other products. So if you don't have money to pay for fertilizers, you definitely would [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1111.76s)]
*  not have money to pay for the end product for the grain or for something else. So what happened? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1116.88s)]
*  If farmers did not bought fertilizers, it means domestic production of agriculture products fell [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1122.64s)]
*  down. Like result, what happened? Domestic prices went up. What means when domestic prices of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1128.4s)]
*  agriculture products goes up? Supply meet demands. In this case, it's very simple. What [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1134.48s)]
*  means supply meet demands? Supply is less, demand becoming also less. What it means? It means before [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1139.92s)]
*  people eat three times a day, and some of them starting to eat two times a day. What means, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1145.92s)]
*  that what means demands in terms of the food? We have numbers and we have researchers which show [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1150.32s)]
*  effect of this action on certain countries, country by country. Well, global food prices have gone up. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1155.6s)]
*  I mean, that's a well-known fact that's almost never in American media connected in any way to [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1161.12s)]
*  sanctions though, or the war in Ukraine or the war against Russia. I mean, but you think that's in [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1166.4799999999998s)]
*  part a result of? Not exactly. It's two different stories. So what story about fertilizers in 222, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1172.56s)]
*  it was story which was alive for about one year. After that, the story basically resolved itself. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1181.12s)]
*  Why it's resolved itself? Because Russian fertilizers found other way to the world market. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1186.96s)]
*  Instead of going through European ports, Baltic country ports or, I don't know, ports of Ukraine. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1192.16s)]
*  So this fertilizer start to go via Russian ports. It took about one year for system to adjust. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1197.6000000000001s)]
*  So issue resolve itself. But when you're referring to the food prices, they're not exactly [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1202.4s)]
*  world food prices. It's a traded commodity. That's, for example, not so much effect of the people in [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1209.76s)]
*  the most of the poor countries. Of course, some countries import food like Egypt, like many other [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1216.72s)]
*  countries, but most really poor countries, they import inputs to produce food. So that's why [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1222.4s)]
*  effect was felt mostly in the of the fertilizer crisis, mostly in the very poor countries, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1229.12s)]
*  countries which were not able to import inputs for the food production. Because what is [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1234.8799999999999s)]
*  fertilizers? Fertilizers input for food production. So that's how it works. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1240.16s)]
*  Yes. Do you think that the lawmakers in the United States who impose sanctions and endorse them, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1244.96s)]
*  which is almost all of them, very few American lawmakers oppose sanctions, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1250.48s)]
*  do you think they thought this through? Do they know the effects of it downstream? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1254.8000000000002s)]
*  About a particular crisis about fertilizers, yes, they know. And I must say that United [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  States authorities dealt much more in a better way compared with Europeans. This problem was [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1264.32s)]
*  created purely by Europeans. So American administration, state department and other [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1270.32s)]
*  authorities actually dealt with the crisis pretty responsible. So they gave opportunity [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1277.04s)]
*  to the sector to receive so-called general licenses, which isolated a company, a fertilizer [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1284.24s)]
*  company from from this type of effects. That's why I would not say nothing but from United States [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1290.24s)]
*  in terms of the food security story. This issue was taken seriously. And we are very, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1295.68s)]
*  basically, world should be thankful for this. But Europeans done a mistake. So in this particular [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1301.68s)]
*  case, it was like this. How do you think the war in Ukraine and the response to it, the sanctions, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1307.76s)]
*  changes in energy distribution, how is that affecting Europe? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1313.68s)]
*  It's affecting big deal. It's affecting big deal. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1317.04s)]
*  It seems that way. How? How? In a certain moment, when the supply of the cheaper energy to the [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1321.52s)]
*  Europe was cut, this energy naturally was replaced by the more expensive energy. That's how it's [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1328.56s)]
*  affected. You used to pay X and now you're paying X plus. So that's it. But that's affected Europe's [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1334.48s)]
*  industrial capacity. I mean, you see BASF moving a lot of its production out of Germany. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1341.36s)]
*  Of course. Of course. That's right. But what does that look like in 10 or 15 years? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1346.9599999999998s)]
*  What's the European economy look like? What does Europe look like? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1351.9199999999998s)]
*  I would not remember exact number, but I think it will be pretty correct to say that 2019, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1356.08s)]
*  European GDP was something about $15 trillion. And United States GDP at the time was about [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1362.4799999999998s)]
*  $15.4 trillion or something like this, slightly bigger. So what is today's GDP of United States? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1368.0s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, it's something about $25 trillion. In Europeans, it's about $16.5 trillion. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1373.84s)]
*  So it was not much growth during this period of time. Of course, no company which builds [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1379.68s)]
*  their business on access to the cheaper energy would consider putting new investment or continue [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1385.76s)]
*  operation in Europe. Because now European prices for energy, it's much higher in the United States. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1391.84s)]
*  Of course, because European prices today, it's a derivative of the price of LNG, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1397.9199999999998s)]
*  liquefied natural gas. So if American consumers, industrial consumers pay Henry Hub, domestic price [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1404.1599999999999s)]
*  of United States, for example, then European consumers need to pay plus, plus, plus a lot of [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1411.6799999999998s)]
*  logistic costs for the same products to be delivered in Europe. So it's a big difference [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1418.16s)]
*  compared with the situations used to be before the war. How has Russia been affected by the war? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1422.88s)]
*  Bad in one way, because it's a big distraction. It's a tragedy. It's a tragedy for the Russian [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1430.3200000000002s)]
*  people for sure. And that's how it's been affected. If you think, if you're asking about economy, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1437.8400000000001s)]
*  okay, economy doing much better than many people expected and many experts expected. So. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1444.64s)]
*  Why? Why? Because a lot of new production coming in place, a lot of new production connected [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1451.92s)]
*  with military industrial complex, first of all. Yes. Did you expect that? I mean, the idea in the [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1458.88s)]
*  United States was once we impose these sanctions and funded Ukraine, the Ukrainian military, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1464.72s)]
*  that it would destroy the Russian economy. I don't think that idea to destroy a Russian economy [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1471.44s)]
*  on the short run, it's very feasible one. I don't think so. Why? It's a quite adaptive [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1478.48s)]
*  economy. It's a quite big economy. It's basically quite smartly run economic system. So I'm pretty [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1485.2s)]
*  sure there are underestimation what Russian economy capable to do. Apparently. Yes. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1493.6000000000001s)]
*  How is it smartly run? We have a good team of technocrats working in the government, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1500.72s)]
*  working in the central bank. And still now biggest part of the Russian economy, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1507.2800000000002s)]
*  basically it's a market based economy. So companies in the under scenario of the stress, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1512.0800000000002s)]
*  trying to find their way to survive and looks like doing them this more or less successfully. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1517.2s)]
*  What do you think Russia learned from, I mean, you said you got to Moscow at 16, you were [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  19 or something in 91 when the Soviet Union collapsed. And then it was what looked like [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1530.8000000000002s)]
*  a pretty dark period in Russia for the next 10 years ish. What do you, how bad was that time? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1536.48s)]
*  And what do you think Russia learned from it? I mean, it was bad for some people, it was good [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1544.0800000000002s)]
*  for some people. So of course, it was a moment of the dramatic change. Something was happening [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1549.92s)]
*  maybe once in once or twice during normal person life. So it was changed from the system where [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1555.6s)]
*  suddenly people receive a lot of freedom, but didn't receive a lot of responsibilities. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1563.84s)]
*  Yes. So that is what happened at this time. So when you receive a lot of freedom, but don't receive [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1568.24s)]
*  responsibility when society not ready to be responsible, what does it does? So it leads to [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1572.32s)]
*  house and that is exactly what started to happen. So at this moment of time, many people who felt [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1577.6s)]
*  comfortable with the previous system were disoriented. It was pretty difficult for them [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1584.0s)]
*  to cope with the new situation. At the same time, completely for this reason, it was a good ground [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1588.56s)]
*  for the people who were not basically connected with the previous way of life, for young people, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1594.96s)]
*  for people who in the simple way had nothing to lose at this moment. So that's a moment when [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1600.64s)]
*  entrepreneurial energy or ability to do something allow you to do what's impossible to do in other [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1605.68s)]
*  periods of time. And I'm very grateful that I was able to live through this period of time. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1611.68s)]
*  How did Putin change Russia? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1618.16s)]
*  It was a quite natural reaction on the situation of the nineties. Nineties brought a lot of, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1621.28s)]
*  let's say, house in Russia. Chaos. Chaos. Yeah. A lot of chaos in Russia. So many people suffer. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1628.8s)]
*  It was pretty difficult. So society was crying for the stability. That was really what was needed. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1635.2s)]
*  And it was a great achievement what Putin did. He brought stability to Russia. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1642.72s)]
*  Are you close to Putin? I never met him one-on-one. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1649.76s)]
*  You've never met Putin one-on-one? Never. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1652.8s)]
*  Oh, so you have absolutely no role in any of this? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1656.0s)]
*  In this? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1659.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. In the governance of Russia. I just can't get past the fact that you're a bystander with [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1659.92s)]
*  a Russian last name and the West stole billions of dollars worth of your assets. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1665.92s)]
*  That's not kind of what we're told the system does. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1672.4s)]
*  You don't seem mad about it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1678.24s)]
*  How can you be mad on something that you cannot control? It's like to be mad on the rain. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1680.24s)]
*  It will pass. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  What do you think the effect on the United States has been of this war in Ukraine? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1685.76s)]
*  Effect? I mean, if you take sanctions and economic part, actually what I don't like, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1692.08s)]
*  I don't like when I hear from the certain politicians when they say it's great for [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1697.68s)]
*  American economy. That's what I don't like. Really? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1701.28s)]
*  Like when people say it's great for the jobs, it's great for the economy, it's great for something. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1704.48s)]
*  Honestly, it makes me sick because to kill other people, if it's even great for your economy, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1709.6s)]
*  it should not be great. You cannot be proud of this. That's what I think about this part of the [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1714.72s)]
*  income input. It's disgusting. I agree. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1720.08s)]
*  From another side, I would say that I know more or less what will be the effect of the sanction. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1722.8s)]
*  So I think it will be the end of the many institutions which were traditional for a [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1730.72s)]
*  number of years. Such institutions like the dollar, like the United States dollar, for example, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1735.76s)]
*  like a global currency. What we see already in this year, for example, foreign trade of China, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1741.6s)]
*  more than 50% of the foreign trade of China done not in dollars anymore. It used to be about 90% [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1748.3999999999999s)]
*  just 12 years ago. So that is what's happening. In Russia, dollar was dominating currency for any [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1754.96s)]
*  outside export-import operation. Today, it's 14%. It's more or less like this. The same process [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1762.8s)]
*  is going in other countries. So that will be one major effect. Basically, I think dollar will lose [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1769.6s)]
*  its position like world-dominating currency much bigger like a result of all of happen. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1774.7199999999998s)]
*  What will be the effect on the United States of losing the dollar as the international currency? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1780.7199999999998s)]
*  I think it's one of the three or four major assets which country has. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1784.7199999999998s)]
*  But what are the practical, as a former banker, what are the practical effects? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1791.84s)]
*  Practical effects? So if less investors won a dollar, it means interest rates are higher, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1796.0s)]
*  inflation is higher, it's more difficult to refinance debts, etc. It means a lot of things. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1801.44s)]
*  When you cannot emit vault currency, it means completely different wealth where you're in. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1807.12s)]
*  This seems obvious as a non-banker. That was my first thought when these sanctions were imposed. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1812.96s)]
*  This will scare people out of using the dollar because it's being used as a political weapon, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1817.44s)]
*  not just a medium of exchange. It's not a safe haven anymore. If I could see that with no education [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1821.84s)]
*  or background at all in this area, why wasn't that obvious to U.S. policymakers? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1828.24s)]
*  Hard to say. Perhaps they're comparing pluses and minuses of such policies. They put balance [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1836.32s)]
*  on the pluses. What would be the pluses from an American perspective? Oh, that's hard for me to [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1844.8799999999999s)]
*  say. That's better to say from the American perspective. I have no idea. Well, I am an American [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1849.84s)]
*  and I don't understand any of this. I don't understand why you would want to kill or depose [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1854.72s)]
*  Putin, which is of course the whole point. I mean, you can like Putin or not. I don't have to live [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1859.6799999999998s)]
*  under Putin, so I don't have strong feelings either way. But why do you think taking Putin out as [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1863.4399999999998s)]
*  president of Russia became the number one objective of the U.S. government? It doesn't seem obvious [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1870.72s)]
*  that that would be your objective. I think it's pretty straightforward. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1875.12s)]
*  You need to look at history not so long, but at least for the 20 years back. So in reality, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1880.6399999999999s)]
*  cooperation between the Russian government and Western governments deteriorated during the last [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1888.2399999999998s)]
*  maybe 20 years. So that was a process. If you see how it developed, it developed with the [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1894.32s)]
*  increase of the NATO presence closer to the Russian borders. It was many other things which [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1901.28s)]
*  basically contributed to this deterioration of relations. And I would not say it was like [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1907.68s)]
*  from one side or from another side. It was a way, it was a number of the things which basically [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1912.88s)]
*  brought us where it brought us. It's become more and more and more difficult during the last 15 [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1918.8s)]
*  years. What is really, from my understanding, all of these events in the Ukraine are? It's just [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1924.08s)]
*  moving from the conflict on the next level escalation. That's what it is. So that was 2014. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1930.3999999999999s)]
*  So what is the reality? It's events of 2022. It's a game. It's a movement of the story which was in [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1936.72s)]
*  the process maybe 15, 20 years of basically unresolved situation of security in Europe [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1943.6799999999998s)]
*  to the next level of escalation. So basically it's one process. Ukraine, for my understanding, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1950.88s)]
*  it wasn't like issue by itself. It's a process of non-understanding, of not ability to communicate, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1955.5200000000002s)]
*  to find the common solution between West United States, first of all, and Russia, which led step [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1962.72s)]
*  by step to step to the new and new levels of the escalation. That was the process. And what [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1968.3200000000002s)]
*  happened during this process? Parties lost trust to each other. So Russian government, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1974.32s)]
*  Russian leadership lost trust in the Western system, inability to find solutions with the [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1980.32s)]
*  Western leaders. Same happened from the Western side. So Western leaders lost trust, inability to [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1986.96s)]
*  find understanding and to resolve complex issue with the Russian leadership. So that is what [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=1995.2s)]
*  happened. So when it's happened, that's probably answering your question, why? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2000.24s)]
*  So it's just a kind of process of forward movement that will go on on the principle of entropy [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2006.08s)]
*  forever until something stops. It sounds like there is no motive. It's just organizations keep [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2013.6s)]
*  going until they don't. Dynamic, it's not very good. So dynamic, it means that because basic [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2019.36s)]
*  issues, basic problems are not resolved or even not articulated sometimes, more and more and more [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2027.28s)]
*  different means of confrontation coming into the play. So for my understanding, basically, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2035.92s)]
*  what's happening in Ukraine, it was one more step towards this escalation. But then again, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2043.76s)]
*  can be another step and can be another step. So unfortunately, we are moving towards this direction, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2049.2799999999997s)]
*  for my opinion right now. Where are we right now, would you say? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2055.36s)]
*  I would say in very dangerous moment, in the moment when, which perhaps we did not experience [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2058.56s)]
*  for last, I would say from 1984, something like this for the last 40 years. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2063.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, the US government is now basically orchestrating a bombing campaign within Russia. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2071.04s)]
*  I mean, the United States is in a hot war with Russia. And this is because the president was [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2078.32s)]
*  just convicted, former President Trump, but there's a lot going on in the US. I don't think that [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2083.52s)]
*  most Americans fully understand we're in a hot war with Russia. So, I mean, they're both nuclear [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2088.48s)]
*  armed powers. What are the chances that this becomes a nuclear exchange? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2094.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, each conflict has its own dynamic. So for now, I don't see forces which is seriously [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2101.44s)]
*  vacant to de-escalation, because it's not defined yet what victory means. It's not defined with what [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2107.6s)]
*  purpose of each conflicting party really is. In reality, it's described, but today these goals are [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2115.36s)]
*  not really discussed. Yeah, it's like one party moving one direction. What, for example, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2122.08s)]
*  Ukrainian party saying, Ukrainian party of this conflict saying, okay, we want something like [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2129.7599999999998s)]
*  go back to the situation when everything was in 2014. Okay, so they want to do de-escalation [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2136.08s)]
*  two steps compared with today's situation. Step before, not to 22, but step 2014. At the same time, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2142.4s)]
*  what from the Russia perspective we are hearing when we are listening news or whatever, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2150.08s)]
*  Russia saying, no, we want something bigger. We want to do de-escalation even farther. We want to [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2154.7999999999997s)]
*  come back to a situation when security arrangement in Europe done in a such way that Russia does not [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2160.3199999999997s)]
*  feel in danger from different sides. So that's what Russia leadership preferring. So why to do [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2165.76s)]
*  one step of de-escalation? We need to do two step de-escalation. So that is like two completely [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2173.6000000000004s)]
*  different languages. So you cannot discuss one part, one type of basically problem and don't [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2178.7200000000003s)]
*  discuss another. So when two parties don't hear each other and each of them kind of living in their [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2186.0s)]
*  own world with their own limitation, what you should predict? You should predict that more [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2192.4s)]
*  people will die, that escalation will continue and God forgive us, but next threshold of escalation [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2197.44s)]
*  can be crossed. Both sides are now openly, sort of openly talking about using nuclear weapons. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2204.7200000000003s)]
*  I never thought I would live to see that. That seems crazy. It's extremely scary. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2210.88s)]
*  Are the Russians worried? Of course, they are. Of course, they are. But once again, even from Russia's [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2216.8s)]
*  side, I can understand basically dynamic, but what I don't understand, I don't understand why [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2224.8s)]
*  West not worrying about. But today's situation remind me very much situation which was in the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2230.6400000000003s)]
*  autumn to 21. So what we saw in the autumn to 21, we saw military maneuvers near Ukrainian border. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2235.76s)]
*  We saw the proposal to come back and to discuss different type of the arrangement, which can make [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2242.96s)]
*  situation a little bit more secure, not a little bit more, but more secure, more predictable. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2248.4s)]
*  When security, it's basically working on both sides, not only against Russia, but also such [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2252.6400000000003s)]
*  arrangement where Russia feels secure. That was a major discussion somewhere in the autumn to 21. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2259.28s)]
*  So Russia came with a certain proposal. It was a lot of discussion. What was the result? The result [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2264.96s)]
*  was actually noise. The result was, okay, it will not happen. The result was, okay, just try to do it, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2269.92s)]
*  and we do something more terrible to you. That was kind of the discussion at this moment of time. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2279.04s)]
*  What Russia did at this time, move situation to the next level of escalation on the basically [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2283.92s)]
*  situation which we in the beginning of the special military operation. That's what Russia did. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2290.7200000000003s)]
*  That happened once. Compare with the situation today, military maneuvers with a tactical nuclear [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2296.0s)]
*  weapon at this time. A lot of basically comments like, oh, don't take it seriously. Mr. Putin [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2303.44s)]
*  did not use bomb for two years. For sure, he will never use it anymore in the future. All of this [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2309.2000000000003s)]
*  kind of the discussion, we need to ignore it because if basically Russia will do it, we will [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2314.32s)]
*  do it something even more terrible. What did it remind you? For me, it's remind to 21 and beginning [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2319.36s)]
*  of 22. But Putin did roll across the border in the end. Putin did roll across the border. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2324.88s)]
*  So why if one time the escalation move on the next basically? So we're almost getting to like [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2332.96s)]
*  theological questions here. Do you think the West wants a nuclear war? I mean, is this an effort to [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2339.04s)]
*  commit suicide? What is this? I think it's just an ability to propose a scenario which basically [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2344.0s)]
*  Western leaders can explain and find the right balance with the... Actually, it's a very difficult [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2351.6s)]
*  question. It is a very difficult question. Society, Western society, was so much [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2361.12s)]
*  basically done supportive to the cause which was promoted by the Western politicians to a certain [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2369.44s)]
*  moment. So because it's so simplified narrative like unprovoked aggression. Unprovoked aggression [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2375.68s)]
*  meaning exist aggressor. If exist aggressor, what you can do? You need to react on unprovoked [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2383.3599999999997s)]
*  aggression to punish. So how can you change this narrative? So this narrative, it's very difficult. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2389.12s)]
*  If you're a politician who is dealing with this limitation, how to deal with this? That's very [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2394.16s)]
*  difficult. Sometimes it's easy just to follow inertia, just to do... Sure, I mean, of course, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2398.48s)]
*  I understand that and their prestige is at stake and no one wants to admit mistake and no one wants [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2404.48s)]
*  to be seen as siding with Putin or being a disloyal American or Belgian or Frenchman or whatever. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2409.76s)]
*  The media control people by attacking them. But you would think that a nuclear exchange would be [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2418.64s)]
*  the moment when people would say, well, I don't care what you call me. We're not going to have [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2424.8s)]
*  a nuclear war because that would be the end of people. And I would do anything I could do to stop [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2429.36s)]
*  that. Anything including accept responsibility for dumb statements I made before, be embarrassed [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2436.2400000000002s)]
*  or being called names. I don't care. I'm going to try and stop nuclear war. I thought that was the [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2440.4s)]
*  red line for people, but it's not. If American society understand the moment where we are. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2444.4s)]
*  I don't think they do. But you think we're at that moment. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that next level of escalation, it's very possible. After that, if you take it like [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2454.96s)]
*  effect, that next level of escalation, it's possible. What next level of escalation may be? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2465.44s)]
*  Well, that's all that's left. But again, it raises the theological question, like, why [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2471.76s)]
*  did Europe decide to destroy itself in 1914? Why is the West once again on the brink of destroying [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2480.2400000000002s)]
*  itself? What is that? It doesn't seem rational at all. I think it's pretty understandable. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2485.92s)]
*  I believe in Western democratic system. Yes, it is. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2492.0800000000004s)]
*  In a certain moment, it's allowed to change the course. So leaders change. And then if some leaders [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2494.1600000000003s)]
*  follow some particular scenario, it's very difficult for them to change their opinion, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2500.4s)]
*  to change the position which they took towards the population of their countries. But when [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2506.88s)]
*  democratic system make a change, then course of society may change also. So I think this problem [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2512.32s)]
*  will pass in one way or another. Problem is how fast this will pass if some tragedy will not [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2519.44s)]
*  happen before. That's what's... So if the leader of the West, the American [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2525.36s)]
*  president changed his view on this, then you think he could lead Europe to deescalate? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2529.6s)]
*  I think we don't have choice, but we must deescalate. Do I believe it's realistic? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2534.96s)]
*  Honestly, the dynamic looks like it's not very realistic right now. It's very difficult. So I [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2539.84s)]
*  don't know. Some American needed in such situation. Really? So you read as a non-American who's not [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2546.16s)]
*  allowed in the United States, but I know you follow this carefully. Do you think Trump is [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2552.96s)]
*  capable of stopping this trajectory of escalation? I don't know. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2556.48s)]
*  Is there any other leader in the world who is? I don't know. I think today, the world in general [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2564.08s)]
*  have a problem with the leaders who can look not on the polarized way to say that is true [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2571.2s)]
*  or that is true, but people who can look a little bit more globally. I think we have a [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2578.7999999999997s)]
*  deficit of these people right now. So, and idea of this constant conflict of these [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2583.44s)]
*  things with the ruptured world on the path, it's become very dangerous. It's become very dangerous. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2590.8s)]
*  So I think that world needs a moment for a little bit of cool down and then probably the process [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2599.6000000000004s)]
*  will start. But remember what stopped the war in Vietnam actually. I think it was only one way [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2606.96s)]
*  which stopped it. It was the slogan. Remember this? Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2612.2400000000002s)]
*  So I think that was probably one of the most important things which happened during this [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2617.68s)]
*  period of time because it's very simple and that goes directly to your conscience. So you repeat [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2622.48s)]
*  something and suddenly you start to think, okay, maybe it's not about communism, capitalism, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2627.68s)]
*  I don't know, detente or something else. Maybe just about something a little bit bigger. That it was [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2633.2799999999997s)]
*  what stopped the war at this time. What will stop war at this time? I don't know. But I don't believe [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2639.12s)]
*  somehow in the deals between politicians right now. I don't believe it somehow. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2644.08s)]
*  In Europe, is there, I mean, you're in Europe, I guess you're not in Europe anymore, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2650.56s)]
*  but do you think the rest of the world understands how close we are to nuclear war? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2655.52s)]
*  I don't know. I think it's like in this movie, don't look up. Something happening, something [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2660.64s)]
*  coming closer, but so many other more interesting things. Here's a fundraiser, here's some other [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2668.0800000000004s)]
*  interesting stories happening. Why to concentrate on such big issues? But in Europe, I think [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2675.84s)]
*  understanding of the situation growing. What's China's role in all this? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2682.0800000000004s)]
*  Hard to say, but I think China behave like very responsible power trying to basically [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2690.1600000000003s)]
*  say everyone, please calm down, please calm down. How strong what China really can do about it? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2697.52s)]
*  That's another question. President Nixon went to China famously 50 years ago in probably a lot of [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2705.84s)]
*  objectives, but the main objective was to solidify the split between Russia and China because you [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2713.2000000000003s)]
*  don't want them to align against you. Of course, if you're the United States, in one day that seems [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2717.1200000000003s)]
*  to have changed. Is the Russia-China alliance strong? Is it enduring? For the next 100 years, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2724.24s)]
*  will those two countries be in an alliance, do you think? It's a country with a huge trade [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2732.0s)]
*  compared to the size of our economy. It's a country with a very long land border. So [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2737.52s)]
*  China is definitely growing world superpower. Probably only two superpowers now we can really [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2746.16s)]
*  count. So yes, of course, so Russia and China would have a strong relation. I hope they will. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2752.8s)]
*  Is there any chance in our lifetimes that Russia and the United States [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2759.52s)]
*  have any kind of reasonable non-antagonistic relationship? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2764.2400000000002s)]
*  We should. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2769.6000000000004s)]
*  I agree. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2770.96s)]
*  We should. It's no any reason. It's no fundamental reason why it should be otherwise. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2771.6000000000004s)]
*  Neither with the United States, Russia, not with Russia and Europe. I don't see any reason why [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2777.2799999999997s)]
*  it should be otherwise. What would happen if you tried to come to the United States? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2782.7999999999997s)]
*  If I will come to the United States, I don't know. I would not get a visa. So how can I come? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2786.64s)]
*  If you went to a European country or Australia, same? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2792.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2796.64s)]
*  Do you think you might be arrested? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2797.6s)]
*  I don't think so. I was simply not allowed to come there. Why to arrest me? I did not [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2799.44s)]
*  do anything wrong. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2803.68s)]
*  How many countries are you banned from visiting? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2804.56s)]
*  European Union, UK, Switzerland, Canada, United States, New Zealand, Australia, that's it. Japan. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2808.72s)]
*  Japan? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2817.8399999999997s)]
*  To be honest, I'm not sure about Japan. I need to check. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2820.0s)]
*  So since you live outside what we think of as the West, and Japan kind of is part of the West in a [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2825.2799999999997s)]
*  way, it has American troops on its soil, how do you see the world changing now that you've been [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2830.64s)]
*  forced outside the old world into the emerging world? Where are the new, where are the freest [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2837.6s)]
*  places in the world? Where's the power coalescing? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2841.92s)]
*  I think the world is organized now. It's unclear where and what will happen where. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2845.6s)]
*  Definitely China is growing with incredible speed. I spent quite a lot of time on China lately and [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2851.68s)]
*  it's amazing. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2857.2799999999997s)]
*  In what way? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2859.12s)]
*  Like when you see what they've done and you compare what was on the same place as 10 years ago, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2860.96s)]
*  so you see the difference. My private foundation, charity foundation, supports kids, talented kids [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2866.56s)]
*  in different areas. One of our projects, we support chemical, let's say, competition between kids from [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2875.12s)]
*  different countries, students. So this year we hold this event in Shenzhen, in China. I remember the [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2882.3199999999997s)]
*  city 25 years ago and I saw the city now. It's unbelievable. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2889.2s)]
*  There's an emphasis, I notice, on building in China, in making things, whereas the emphasis [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2897.8399999999997s)]
*  in the West seems to be on banking. What's the difference between a society that builds things [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2903.6s)]
*  and a society that lends money and interest? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2909.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, both societies are trying to resolve the same issue, to make people [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2912.48s)]
*  in this country feel better. So there are many ways which lead to the top of the mountain. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2917.6s)]
*  One society going one direction, another going another direction. Hard to say what's better. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2923.9199999999996s)]
*  Which is a stronger society? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2928.7999999999997s)]
*  American. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2930.3199999999997s)]
*  America. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2931.3599999999997s)]
*  Of course. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2932.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2933.2799999999997s)]
*  Democracy. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2935.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2935.9199999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2937.2799999999997s)]
*  Good history of democracy, rule of law, traditions. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2937.84s)]
*  Do you think that, and I agree with you completely, I strongly believe in democracy and, of course, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2943.92s)]
*  rule of law. But I wonder what the less than the rest of the world is taking from the last couple [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2949.04s)]
*  of years. I mean, do you think there will be other countries that want to sign on to the [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2954.88s)]
*  democratic project? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2959.12s)]
*  It's very difficult to say what the democratic project is. But, I mean, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2961.52s)]
*  we are going through the period of time when dominance of one superpower of the United States, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2965.84s)]
*  it will not be in the future like it was before. For sure, China has done a great, incredible job. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2971.2000000000003s)]
*  And we will see at least two superpowers which will, in one way or another, organize world [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2977.6000000000004s)]
*  affairs going forward. At the same time, we see a number of the countries who will become strong [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2983.2000000000003s)]
*  regional leaders. So we are going to completely different arrangements of the world. World which [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2987.84s)]
*  you can call it multipolar. But the world which is completely different dynamic. That's why we are [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2994.32s)]
*  moving now, from my understanding. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=2999.76s)]
*  And what does it look like in, say, 10 years? What are the... So I imagine it's the English-speaking [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3001.6800000000003s)]
*  countries, Europe, maybe Latin America, maybe not, and then everybody else. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3006.48s)]
*  Again, it's very hard to say. So let's assume that situation which we are talking about, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3014.4s)]
*  this escalation level will not be crossed. Let's assume that some miracle will happen, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3020.64s)]
*  which will bring world to the de-escalation, and slowly, slowly, new order will start to emerge. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3025.68s)]
*  So how situation will develop in this scenario? Hard to say. There are bad scenario and good [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3031.2799999999997s)]
*  scenario. Bad scenario, it's again, to come back to the cycle of the Cold War, basically, to come [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3036.7999999999997s)]
*  back 40 years ago, where there are a couple of blocks, let's say, United States, one side, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3043.52s)]
*  China from another side, couple countries which trying to, I mean, do something independent [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3050.32s)]
*  little bit. So something like this. That's a dangerous world, from my understanding, because [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3056.4s)]
*  it will be just a repetition of something what we already seen. So competition, where there are [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3061.44s)]
*  only two poles, couple steps after, can lead to nothing else but to the very difficult confrontations, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3066.64s)]
*  very difficult fight for the different resources, for access to this and this. That's, from my [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3074.24s)]
*  understanding, a situation which not very sustainable, to put it this way. So if there is [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3079.12s)]
*  another scenario, if there is a scenario where something else may happen, perhaps. So what it [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3086.3199999999997s)]
*  can be? It means, should be possibility for some other countries to basically work with the both [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3093.2s)]
*  sides, to work with one superpower and from another superpower. To work, it means to have security [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3100.72s)]
*  arrangements, to have understanding, to have investment from the both sides, to have trade [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3106.72s)]
*  with both sides. And if such countries, such actors will be basically, more and more of them [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3111.04s)]
*  will be forming the world, that's, from my understanding, what can make the world more solid, more [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3119.12s)]
*  stable, more sustainable. So how to make sure that we did not come to competition where either you are [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3124.7999999999997s)]
*  with us or you're our enemy. But how to come to a situation when acceptance of the abilities of countries [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3131.3599999999997s)]
*  to not be neither on one side, not on another side, conceived, basically, treated like something good, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3139.2799999999997s)]
*  like something what's in the interest of stability of the system. I'm sorry, maybe my English not so [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3147.84s)]
*  well and maybe I'm not delivering the logic. I'm following every word. Let me ask you the stated [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3152.8s)]
*  objective, I don't know officially, but certainly policymakers and lawmakers say it, is to kill [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3159.6800000000003s)]
*  Putin or knock him out of his position to get rid of Putin. I know you don't live in Russia and you [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3165.44s)]
*  don't know Putin, but as one who knows the country, what would happen if Putin disappeared tomorrow? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3172.0s)]
*  Firstly, I live in the country and I consider myself Russian. Yes. So it's not correct to say [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3177.44s)]
*  that I'm not living in the country. Oh, you're not? Okay, great. Yeah. So for the last three years, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3183.36s)]
*  I spent in Russia more time than any other countries. That's changed a lot. So what would [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3186.8s)]
*  happen if Putin disappeared tomorrow? What would happen to Russia? It's such a big complicated [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3191.68s)]
*  country and it seems like whatever you think of Putin, he holds it together. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3197.52s)]
*  Chaos. Chaos. Any type of the, it will increase level of the uncertainty. Like in any system, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3200.32s)]
*  which is basically very centralized and Russia became very centralized system in the [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3209.76s)]
*  last decade or so. So any unexpected changes only will increase house. So chaos. Yes. So where [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3216.1600000000003s)]
*  exactly this increase of the chaos will lead? That is again, very much depends on many other [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3224.8s)]
*  situations during this particular time. But I think it's very bad scenario for, and I don't [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3230.08s)]
*  even want to think about it. Oh, that bad. I mean, it seems that way as a total outsider, if you have [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3235.84s)]
*  the biggest country in the world with very complicated demographic mix and a lot of different [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3242.64s)]
*  parts of the country, you don't have that much in common with each other. It seems like with a lot [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3248.4s)]
*  of nuclear weapons that could be bad for the world. House it's in general, sorry. Chaos. Chaos. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3253.44s)]
*  Yeah. Chaos. It's very dangerous weapon. So when this weapon apply, it's a create instability in [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3261.52s)]
*  the system. When chaos was apply, let's say in Afghanistan or in Iraq or in Yugoslavia 30 years [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3267.68s)]
*  ago, how long it took before stability was brought to the same places. So in situation like Russia, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3273.92s)]
*  any type of the chaos, I don't think firstly, system will be destroyed by the chaos because [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3281.04s)]
*  Russian people, Russian society already came through the very different period of time in [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3289.52s)]
*  the nineties where it was a lot of chaos and society received kind of the vaccination against [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3294.4s)]
*  this type of the disease. They had chaos, they don't want it again. Exactly. So that's why I'm [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3301.12s)]
*  pretty sure what will happen if more chaos will appear in the system. Our system will react with [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3305.92s)]
*  a more centralization, with more concentration of the power, with less freedom. That's what will [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3312.2400000000002s)]
*  happen. But is it good or bad? I think it's very bad for the Russia and very bad for the rest of [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3317.6s)]
*  the world because when system becoming more concentrated on defending itself, when it see [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3324.48s)]
*  dangerous everywhere instead of the opportunities, even if dangerous not exist, they will appear. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3331.8399999999997s)]
*  That's right. And they will follow and they will come to next conference. That's exactly right. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3336.96s)]
*  A little bit late. So what happens to Ukraine since you are in some sense in the agriculture [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3340.7999999999997s)]
*  business and that's a, I mean, I know you know a lot about Ukraine. Do you have a Ukrainian parent? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3346.16s)]
*  My mother is Ukrainian. Yes. So you're familiar with Ukraine. Zelensky has apparently, I heard [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3351.6s)]
*  from a Ukrainian two days ago, backed a new law that will allow foreigners to buy own property [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3357.84s)]
*  in Ukraine. It does feel like maybe the effect of this war is foreign companies buying a lot of [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3364.88s)]
*  Ukrainian land and moving a new population in. Maybe that's just a dark guess. What do you think [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3371.1200000000003s)]
*  the future looks like for Ukraine? It's a tragedy what happens there. That's exactly the situation [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3375.76s)]
*  when country became a stage for competition with outside powers. So that's exactly what should not [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3381.52s)]
*  happen with any other country. So that may happen. It was a chance that the same scenario could happen [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3388.24s)]
*  before in Georgia. St. Gathe did not happen. It was possibility the same scenario could happen [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3395.84s)]
*  before in Belorussia, probably in Kazakhstan. Now Armenia living through the most serious, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3401.36s)]
*  on the period similar to this. So it's very dangerous when country becoming a competition [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3406.4s)]
*  ring between superpowers, between even the regional power and global power. So that is [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3413.6s)]
*  what's happening there. So that's example which is very, very bad. And such example unfortunately [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3420.7200000000003s)]
*  exists not only in this ex-Soviet sphere. Such examples we can see elsewhere. So for example, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3427.12s)]
*  the Horn of Africa. So you see a conflict in the Sudan. So more people were killed or injured [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3434.0s)]
*  in Sudan than Ukraine and Gaza combined. How often do you speak about it? Never. That's a [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3440.08s)]
*  disturbing question of course. So as soon as competition starting to happen like this, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3446.24s)]
*  that's the worst scenario for any country to be in. So that is what happened with Ukraine. Hopefully [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3454.48s)]
*  other countries will look at an example and try to not be there. That's why I think as a model, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3460.0s)]
*  it's much more positive. It's a model when a country is not trying to be one side or another [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3464.72s)]
*  side. Not trying to find which house is better. To compete in the competition where they have [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3470.4s)]
*  nothing to gain. So I think the best way for such countries is to try to find the balance and to be [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3479.12s)]
*  good with everyone. So that is I think much better way. I want to ask you about climate [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3485.2s)]
*  and the response to climate change. So I live in a place that had glaciers 15,000 years ago. It's [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3490.7999999999997s)]
*  very obvious from the landscape as it is in many parts of the world. So from my perspective, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3496.24s)]
*  there has very obviously been radical climate change that has nothing to do with human behavior. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3500.7999999999997s)]
*  And yet my government and most Western governments, like world governments in general, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3506.72s)]
*  all agree that climate change is caused by human behavior. And we need to stop climate change by [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3510.72s)]
*  changing human behavior in ways that will kill humans. You're very closely connected to [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3517.3599999999997s)]
*  agriculture and watch world politics carefully. What's your view of what causes climate change? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3525.2s)]
*  I don't think it's so important to tell the truth. I think more important is the fact that [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3531.12s)]
*  temperature of the surface of the planet is changing. That's a matter of fact. It's also [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3537.28s)]
*  true and very possible that the number of dangerous anomalies, natural anomalies, will increase [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3544.0s)]
*  like the consequence of the warming of the surface of the planet. So the intensity of hurricanes, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3551.84s)]
*  more floods, more droughts. So these kinds of things will increase. It's very possible. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3559.0400000000004s)]
*  They will bring more damage, material damage to the property or damage to the way of living [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3565.12s)]
*  for the people. That's all nice. That's all understandable. But I think what's wrong if [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3571.04s)]
*  from these facts we are jumping to the question and starting to discuss who is guilty. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3577.8399999999997s)]
*  Who is guilty? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3583.2s)]
*  That is what is I think very wrong. Because of course it's more natural way to start discussion [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3584.48s)]
*  from this. Because we're all following certain type of the thinking, which is maybe it's coming [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3590.72s)]
*  from really how you said before from a religious perspective or whatever. Because it's always the [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3596.72s)]
*  same circle. Firstly, there is a sin. Somebody done something bad. Then there is punishment. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3601.2799999999997s)]
*  Something bad happened because somebody done sin. Then there is how you say it in English. You [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3608.16s)]
*  recognize basically. You admit that you cause this. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3613.7599999999998s)]
*  You repent or atone. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3617.6s)]
*  Yeah. So that is next stage. No. And then after, only after basically you can come back to the [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3619.12s)]
*  paradise or whatever people call it. So that is more or less the same pattern. In the same pattern, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3624.72s)]
*  when you speak, somehow distract from the issue on the table. Because what is the issue? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3629.92s)]
*  Issue is how to deal with the problem. So instead of the question how to deal with the problem, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3635.3599999999997s)]
*  you suddenly start to think how to deal with the person who caused the problem. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3640.24s)]
*  That's I think the problem. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3645.2s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3647.52s)]
*  I think you're exactly right. Well, just a bit as a matter of fact. Okay. So if you assume that CO2 [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3648.08s)]
*  emissions drive climate change, which is an assumption. I don't think I've ever proven that, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3654.4s)]
*  but that's everyone's assumption. What percentage of CO2 emissions come from people and human [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3659.2799999999997s)]
*  behavior as opposed to natural? Okay. So let's look on it from the different perspectives then, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3664.48s)]
*  if I may. So firstly, I think it's not important who caused the problem. So the same answer goes [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3670.08s)]
*  to everything. In the climate change, I don't think it's important who caused it. It's a question [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3675.84s)]
*  is we need to address it. All right. So let's start it from there. Let's start to address the [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3680.32s)]
*  problem instead of looking for a person who did it. By the way, the same pattern goes about everything. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3684.56s)]
*  Maybe in some conflicts, instead of looking who caused it, we have to think about it. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3691.28s)]
*  I understand about casting blame. I think you're absolutely right. And it does become a political [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3695.44s)]
*  vehicle to punish your enemies and people who don't vote for you. It's clearly what's happening. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3699.6800000000003s)]
*  But you also can't solve a problem if you don't know its source. If you don't know why it's [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3703.68s)]
*  happening, how can you fix it? Okay. So how you can fix it. So in the case of the climate, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3707.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's better to start from the facts. Normally, there are two types of people, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3713.7599999999998s)]
*  two kinds of people. People who like to learn and people who like to believe. So I think in [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3719.12s)]
*  this type of the question, we need to concentrate more on learning, on understanding. I agree. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3726.24s)]
*  Rather than on beliefs. So coming back to the learning. So surface of our planet receive [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3731.6800000000003s)]
*  radiation from the sun, approximately, I don't know, 340 megawatts per square meter. So that is [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3736.6400000000003s)]
*  what's happening. After that, that is hitting the source of our planet. But part of this heat, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3744.0800000000004s)]
*  it's reflected. It's going back to the space. In case if you don't have atmosphere, what happens? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3752.6400000000003s)]
*  So temperature of our planet will be perhaps 35 degrees lower than it is now. So why it's not [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3759.12s)]
*  lower? Because we have atmosphere. What is atmosphere? Inside of our atmosphere, there are [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3765.2799999999997s)]
*  certain gases which we call greenhouse gases. Major of them is water vapor. Second, it's CO2, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3770.48s)]
*  then methane, then others. So what these gases do, they reflect heat back to the surface. About [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3775.92s)]
*  three quarters of the heat is reflected. It's going back to the surface. So we experience kind [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3783.7599999999998s)]
*  of infrared sound effect when basically, firstly, direct sun exposure and after that, reflected [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3789.9199999999996s)]
*  heat waves coming. So that's how it works. So why I'm explaining of this? Okay. So let's imagine [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3797.7599999999998s)]
*  we are not looking home to blame for the problem. But in reality, we are just trying to [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3804.72s)]
*  put temperature a little bit down. Let's say a degree or two down. We are trying to find these [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3811.36s)]
*  knobs, how you call it, on the thermostat to turn them down and make temperature a little bit lower. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3816.88s)]
*  So what you normally would consider? So question number one, you want to increase reflection of [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3822.64s)]
*  the heat from the surface of the planet, wouldn't you? So that will be first question. That's what [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3828.4s)]
*  inside they call albedo. So it's an ability of the surface to reflect [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3833.84s)]
*  waves coming from the surface. So white color, basically, if you have a mirror, your albedo is [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3840.6400000000003s)]
*  one. If you have a completely dark something, your albedo is zero. Everything else goes in the middle. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3847.1200000000003s)]
*  So if you want that surface heated less, what you do, you increase albedo. Step number one. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3853.1200000000003s)]
*  Step number two, what you want to do? You want to decrease reflection in the atmosphere, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3859.84s)]
*  which is going back to the surface. In other words, you want to decrease the concentration [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3866.1600000000003s)]
*  of the greenhouse gases atmosphere. That's two. So the heat can escape? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3871.6800000000003s)]
*  Then heat will not go back, but will escape. So that's actually two actions which you want to [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3876.08s)]
*  take. Are there any difference? No, because it doesn't matter. Either you basically send more [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3880.48s)]
*  out of the surface, or you allow less to come back to the surface. It's wax in the same direction. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3887.68s)]
*  You want to address this all. Now, one more fact to add here. So when we're talking about greenhouse [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3895.7599999999998s)]
*  gases, another just numbers. So our planet emits about 820 gigatons of equivalent of CO2 per year. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3902.08s)]
*  Humans emit about 54 gigatons out of this 820. So it's about 6%. So that is input of the human [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3911.44s)]
*  greenhouse gases emission. It's 6% of the total. 6% of the total. That's why if you look on all of [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3920.8s)]
*  it combined, it's really unexplainable. I mean, from the logical perspective, why all attention [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3928.96s)]
*  is given not to the changing of the albedo of the surface of our planet, or not to the addressing [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3936.16s)]
*  other 94% of the emission which is coming from the nature. But why all attention concentrated on this [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3944.96s)]
*  6% of total? That's very difficult to explain from the logical perspective. So that's what's beginning. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3952.24s)]
*  After that, naturally, question number two can be asked. Is it possible to address either remaining [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3961.12s)]
*  94% of greenhouse gases? Or what does it really mean to change albedo of the surface? Is it feasible? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3967.8399999999997s)]
*  What does it mean? Of course it's feasible. So what means to change natural emission, this 94%? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3976.56s)]
*  Plant forest, that's about it. So midos, it's about this. Deal with the permafrost, which is covering [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3984.1600000000003s)]
*  big storages of the carbon in the underneath. It's also to deal with the CO2, which is trapped there. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=3994.2400000000002s)]
*  So there are different ways to affect natural-caused emissions. That calls natural-based [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4004.0s)]
*  solutions. There are estimations and numbers that show the potential of it. It's about 18 gigatons, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4010.8s)]
*  20 gigatons, so numbers like this. So it's more or less about half of the anthropogenic emissions [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4016.5600000000004s)]
*  can be much more cheaply mitigated by natural-based solution. So that's story number one. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4022.96s)]
*  Story number two about albedo. I'm sorry, I'm going to leave it in the deep. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4029.36s)]
*  May I ask you to just pause on one question? So planting forest is number one. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4033.84s)]
*  It's one of the options. In the natural-based solution, planting forest, it's one of the options. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4038.24s)]
*  That seems easy, cheap, it creates beauty, it helps everybody to plant forest. Why is that being done? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4042.96s)]
*  Yes, it's done, but not on the very big scale. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4053.04s)]
*  Where is it being done? In many places in the world, planting of the forest happening now. China, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4055.8399999999997s)]
*  by the way, the biggest place where about 250 million tons of the emissions now absorbed by [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4061.2s)]
*  the forest plant in China during the last 20 years. Why isn't it being done in more places? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4066.96s)]
*  We will come to this, I promise. Okay, sorry. We will come to this. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4074.64s)]
*  I like that idea so much that I had to pause. But forest is only one of the possible solutions. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4077.52s)]
*  There are many others. Forest is one of them. But once again, so there are opportunities to [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4083.44s)]
*  react on the greenhouse emission from the natural sources. That's story number one. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4091.28s)]
*  Second big story, which is unlike, let's say, natural-based solution, almost not used at all. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4095.36s)]
*  Almost not used today at all. That's to affect albedo. It means to affect how much energy [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4102.4800000000005s)]
*  basically reflected out of the surface of the planet. What does it mean? For example, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4111.84s)]
*  to paint roof whites, that means change albedo. It was black, become white. Or to change [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4117.68s)]
*  color of the roads. Or, for example, to plant certain types of the grass, of meadows, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4125.5199999999995s)]
*  or something like this. I'll give you numbers. So, typical, let's say, gas power plant in Texas [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4132.799999999999s)]
*  will produce maybe 2.5 million tons of CO2 per year. So, in order to absorb it by albedo, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4138.4s)]
*  it will need to be, I would say, 15,000 hectares. You need to change albedo for 004. I'm sorry for [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4144.719999999999s)]
*  technical details. It's not very much. So, for example, when you plant in the black soil cotton, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4152.0s)]
*  it's increase albedo about five times bigger. So, that's how you can compensate one by another. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4157.6s)]
*  Well, you can fight climate change by planting cotton? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4164.16s)]
*  It's very good. It's very good instrument to change albedo of the surface. It's one of many. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4167.12s)]
*  You can plant, you can paint surface of the buildings. You can, I don't know, do certain [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4173.6s)]
*  techniques which allow ice to melt a little bit later because when it's ice, it's kind of a mirror. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4180.64s)]
*  So, albedo of the ice is very high. It reflects a lot. And when ice, for example, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4186.8s)]
*  melts during summer period of time, what's happening is basically what is underneath [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4191.280000000001s)]
*  ice becoming exposed to the atmosphere. And that is usually black color. So, albedo is increasing. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4197.76s)]
*  So, if you can find solution which allows ice to melt a little bit for the shorter period of time [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4203.04s)]
*  in Arctic, that's also very effective way. And you mentioned painting the roads white? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4209.36s)]
*  What's wrong about it? No, I've never thought of that. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4215.04s)]
*  Or painting the roofs. When it's very hot, what you do on the street, you're trying to wear white. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4217.92s)]
*  Of course. When it's very cold, you're trying to wear black. Why? Because black make you warmer. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4224.88s)]
*  White reflects sun. Same goes about any other things. But amazing thing is that it's very [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4229.679999999999s)]
*  simple, very cheap, and basically numbers which can be achieved by this are comparable to what [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4237.28s)]
*  we are doing now with anthropogenic emission. Like I said, Texas, to offset emission dying [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4245.759999999999s)]
*  by the typical power plant, gas power plant, you need 15,000 hectares. Maybe 10,000 of hectares [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4252.32s)]
*  will do. So, one versus another. So, what I'm trying to say is that there are [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4258.88s)]
*  holes. There is a problem, change of the temperature. There is a desire to do it. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4264.96s)]
*  So, there is a very strange way how we deal with this today. We found someone whom to blame, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4272.24s)]
*  human in this case, and trying to reduce what humans do. But there are a number of other options. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4278.32s)]
*  What is the good news? You can do something with albedo and you can do something with a number of [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4285.92s)]
*  the natural-based solutions. And from my understanding that we don't have other way forward. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4291.36s)]
*  I mean, you're a private sector businessman. I'm around politicians a lot. So, it's obvious to me [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4297.679999999999s)]
*  why we're pursuing the less effective way, which is that it gives political leaders more control [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4304.639999999999s)]
*  over their populations. If I paint every house roof white, or if I plant cotton, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4311.44s)]
*  rather than some other crop, it doesn't give me any more power. But if I control what kind of [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4318.0s)]
*  appliances people use, or if I close down coal plants and replace them with ineffective means [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4323.44s)]
*  of electricity generation, then I'm more powerful. Isn't that the answer to the question? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4328.96s)]
*  That's partially an answer. That's partially an answer. In reality, I think if you go back [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4333.36s)]
*  a little bit to the history, how it happened that suddenly, humanity started to concentrate [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4340.4s)]
*  on this climate change story. Actually, it started, I would say, at the end of the 80s. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4347.36s)]
*  So, it started maybe from the speech of the Prime Minister of England, Margaret Thatcher, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4355.839999999999s)]
*  which was delivered in 1989 in the United Nations. So, what was the moment at that time? Basically, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4361.36s)]
*  it was a moment when the world seems to move away from the previous big danger, from the nuclear [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4368.32s)]
*  war. So, that was a moment of kind of reorganization of the world. And that was exactly the idea of her [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4374.4s)]
*  speech. So, she said that, okay, now when one problem passes, we have the ability to concentrate [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4380.32s)]
*  on another, on dealing with the climate change. It's always good to have something that you find [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4386.08s)]
*  against, don't you think so? So, that was the beginning of the story. After that, three years [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4390.08s)]
*  after that, in Rio de Janeiro, the convention was signed. In the day of the earth, the convention [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4395.28s)]
*  was signed. The convention started to put in place a formal mechanism of combating possible climate [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4400.96s)]
*  change implications, etc. There are many strategies which can be applied in order to move forward with [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4408.08s)]
*  this task. But at this moment, a particular strategy was chosen. A strategy which was [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4416.639999999999s)]
*  concentrating on killing fossil fuels or reducing dependence from the fossil fuels in different [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4422.4s)]
*  industrial processes. So, that was a moment when it happened. So, the question is why it happened [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4427.759999999999s)]
*  at that time exactly in this way. I think it's happened because at this moment of time, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4433.28s)]
*  international institutions which were concerned with this issue, the United Nations and others, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4443.12s)]
*  were basically dominated exclusively by the western influence at this moment of time. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4448.08s)]
*  They were basically because it was not other powers in the world at this moment of time. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4457.04s)]
*  So, how some people call it, it was the end of the history moment. So, it was one power and [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4461.76s)]
*  all institutions in one way or another basically moved towards goals more beneficial for this power [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4468.8s)]
*  at this moment of time. So, why western countries took away the combating climate change through [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4477.44s)]
*  this specific mechanism, through the combating of the dependency on the fossil fuels or dependency [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4485.839999999999s)]
*  of the industrial processes from the fossil fuels. Very simple because it was two benefits. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4492.639999999999s)]
*  Benefit number one, to reduce dependence of energy imported from the faraway places. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4498.16s)]
*  Yes. Energy security. Okay. So, that's a good reason. It's a pretty good reason. And second [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4504.16s)]
*  reason was that new technologies which is needed in order to produce energy, not from the fossil [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4510.72s)]
*  fuels but let's say from renewable and other sources or new industrial processes which need [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4520.08s)]
*  to be developed to do other job without using fossil fuels. Basically, the idea was that country [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4524.88s)]
*  who will start to do it first will get a technological advantage and will create not only [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4531.92s)]
*  something good for their own economy but later will be able to provide the same solution to [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4538.96s)]
*  other countries and like this maintain technological leadership. So, that was a logic. So, why [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4543.76s)]
*  basically directions was moved towards this? Think about it. If you're talking about planting of the [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4549.84s)]
*  trees, it's nice but where to plant it? In Russia, in Brazil, somewhere in Africa? So, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4557.52s)]
*  definitely not in Europe because not so much space available which basically not used for other [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4563.52s)]
*  purposes, for agriculture or other productive purposes. So, that's why idea moved towards this [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4570.320000000001s)]
*  direction. Also, it was more easier to let's say to sell to the voters because investments done [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4576.0s)]
*  at your home, working places created at your home but at the same time you're kind of fighting global [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4584.08s)]
*  problem. In this situation, climate change is very specific story because we have one atmosphere for [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4590.16s)]
*  whole the planet. It's very unusual compared with other problems. If you want to give people access [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4596.96s)]
*  to the water, you need to do something where these people live. If you wanted to do something with [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4603.36s)]
*  climate change, you can do investment in your own territory benefiting your industry and your [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4608.96s)]
*  taxpayers but still fighting global good. So, this is kind of asymmetry. That's the idea and that's [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4613.92s)]
*  how it's been sold but in effect, climate policy has reduced the standard of living of people [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4621.92s)]
*  in the United States and Europe. It's made energy more expensive, it's made them poorer. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4628.0s)]
*  Actually, what happened exactly what it should happen. So, by applying something what is [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4633.68s)]
*  relatively expensive, slowly, slowly local industry start to be not very competitive. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4640.8s)]
*  Like a result, working places and production start to shift away to the countries where it's more [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4646.72s)]
*  competitive, more competitive to do. So, like a result, that is what really happened. So, who is [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4652.08s)]
*  leader today in terms of the solar panels, in the wind basically, of course, China, electric cars. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4657.92s)]
*  So, that's what happened. So, basically, western countries started trend with decarbonization, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4665.28s)]
*  trying to achieve one result but in reality, another result was achieved during the same [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4671.68s)]
*  period of time. What western countries do today? First of all, I will tell about Europe because [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4678.4s)]
*  they are in the forefront of all of these processes. So, okay, domestic industry become [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4683.68s)]
*  not competitive. So, what you do? So, firstly, you try to subsidize them using basically different [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4689.4400000000005s)]
*  budget money. Okay, but then your competitors starting to do the same. I'm talking about China [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4696.72s)]
*  or other countries or United States like famous inflation reduction act of the President Biden, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4702.240000000001s)]
*  which is bringing a lot of money to subsidize renewable energy. So, we start competition [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4708.4s)]
*  of this. Okay, one story, but poor countries cannot compete. They don't have money for this. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4714.0s)]
*  Second, what Europeans doing and what will happen in another countries as well. You start to create [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4719.5199999999995s)]
*  a barrier for the goods which is produced in other part of the world but which should enter [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4725.04s)]
*  your territory, meaning if carbon reduction in your domestic place cost, I don't know what it [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4730.719999999999s)]
*  cost today, maybe 80 euros. And if some producer produce goods in another place of the world where [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4736.16s)]
*  carbon reduction cost zero, so his products when they're coming to the Europe, he will need to [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4742.88s)]
*  pay duty. It's so-called CAPM mechanism. They will need to pay duties to compensate the cost for [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4749.04s)]
*  difference with the cost with European producers. In other words, the story is pushed for other [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4757.5199999999995s)]
*  countries to follow the same agenda. So, that's basically where we are. Step number one, it was [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4763.44s)]
*  logical to choose from the perspective of the Western countries to choose this course on the [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4771.759999999999s)]
*  certain moment of time. So, number two, it did not brought them too many good because basically [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4776.639999999999s)]
*  simply they start to kill their industries which start to move to another place. Yes, I notice. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4783.919999999999s)]
*  Now, they're starting to do step number three, trying to be protective to create certain type [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4788.48s)]
*  of trade barriers based on the different carbon prices. So, that's where we are going. Everything [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4794.32s)]
*  gets nice, only it has nothing to do with the climate. If you're focusing on reducing the [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4801.44s)]
*  activity that produces only 6% of greenhouse gases, then you're probably not going to have a big effect [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4808.4s)]
*  on global climate, right? What we know is that whatever we do, temperature keeps rising. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4814.24s)]
*  Concentration of greenhouse gases and atmosphere keeps rising. But at the same time, when we read [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4821.599999999999s)]
*  numbers of the resources allocated towards fight with the human pollutions, what we see today, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4828.16s)]
*  numbers is about $5 trillion annually in order for the world to be on the trajectory till 2030, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4834.0s)]
*  where we are trying to be. It requires about $5 trillion to be spent annually for this. It's [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4840.64s)]
*  roughly 5% of the world GDP. It's comparable with the numbers which spend for all defense globally. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4848.0s)]
*  It's about $3.5 trillion, for example. So, of course, these resources are not easily available. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4855.04s)]
*  Especially, they're not easily available in countries which don't have financial means to [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4863.4400000000005s)]
*  attract this money from the market or don't have strong budgets or other possibilities. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4868.56s)]
*  So, like a result, what happened? The ability of the humanity to react on other important issues [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4875.68s)]
*  was greatly reduced. The United Nations counted 17 sustainability development goals, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4882.64s)]
*  like fight poverty, access to electricity, etc. So, climate is goal number 13 in this list. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4888.88s)]
*  Really, number 13. But that's goal, allocate most of the resources. And that's the problem. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4895.52s)]
*  So, what I'm trying to say, maybe on the certain stage, it was a good idea that Western countries [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4902.400000000001s)]
*  start to follow a particular way to combat climate. Who cares? If rich guys want to spend [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4908.160000000001s)]
*  their money doing something good for the world and their own territories, you can only say, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4914.160000000001s)]
*  Thank you. Nothing else. But now, this story started to affect others very much. More poor [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4918.24s)]
*  countries, countries who cannot really compete with the Western countries in this type of [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4924.96s)]
*  the arrangement. And what it means? It means this policy is more or less clear now for everyone. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4930.0s)]
*  It's not about climate anymore. It's about something else. It's about business. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4937.12s)]
*  Clearly, the concern, I think, just as an American is that, you know, the country runs on [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4943.280000000001s)]
*  electricity, on energy, and the alternatives to hydrocarbons don't seem like they work very well. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4949.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, how? I mean, you're in business, use a lot of energy in your business. Could you run [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4956.160000000001s)]
*  the United States on renewables? Will that be possible anytime in the next 100 years? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4961.68s)]
*  What would happen if you tried to run the United States on wind and solar? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4966.88s)]
*  I mean, the price of energy will be higher. That's what will happen. The price of energy [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4972.56s)]
*  will be higher. So, it will be much higher than we do have now. So, is it good or not? It very [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4978.160000000001s)]
*  much depends on what will happen in other countries. Because by itself, it's important if [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4985.52s)]
*  the American industry will be competitive with these prices. Because if it's competitive with [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4991.92s)]
*  these prices, the market will adjust itself, and at the end of the day, it will be good for American [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=4997.04s)]
*  people rather than bad. But I don't think other countries will follow this agenda. The agenda [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5001.2s)]
*  where just all basically added profit in the supply chain, staying in few particular places in the [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5006.8s)]
*  world. I think this type of the world order is not sustainable, and unlikely it will be possible to [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5015.04s)]
*  maintain it for a very long time. And also, to don't forget one thing. So, all of this done [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5022.32s)]
*  in order to fight climate change. What I'm trying to say, all of these arrangements have nothing to [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5028.56s)]
*  do with fighting climate. I've noticed. They have something to do in order to justify a certain type [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5034.0s)]
*  of the trading policies. Can I ask you one last question about energy before I get into the [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5039.6s)]
*  solutions that you think would actually work? And that's AI. It seems to, you know, server farms are [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5045.52s)]
*  a massive draw of energy, and AI seems to, as projected, be one of the biggest consumers of [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5052.56s)]
*  electricity in the United States. So, I mean, doesn't that kind of make the transition away [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5057.360000000001s)]
*  from hydrocarbons impossible? How could you power all that? Everything possible if you have money. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5064.72s)]
*  Is it reasonable to do everything that's possible? Usually in life, it's not. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5071.52s)]
*  Good point. I noticed that AI seems to be exempt from climate concerns. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5075.76s)]
*  Like, your car is bad, but server farms are not bad. What did you mean when you said, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5082.16s)]
*  specifically, permafrost? If you wanted to reduce greenhouse gases, you would deal with permafrost. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5087.44s)]
*  What would you do? What is permafrost? So, beneath the permafrost, usually there are organic matters. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5091.84s)]
*  So, meaning, some time ago, it was forest, it was, I don't know, meadows, it was something else. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5100.4s)]
*  And then, glacier came, cover, but what was there before remains under. So, what's happening when [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5106.96s)]
*  permafrost is melting? And it's melting now. By the way, I should say that average temperature [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5112.8s)]
*  of our planet increased about 1.5 degrees. That's more or less number. But Arctic- [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5118.08s)]
*  Over what period? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5124.24s)]
*  I mean, compared with pre-industrial level, how to say. Yeah, but that's not distributed equally. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5125.76s)]
*  So, Arctic, it's warming much faster. So, temperature in the Arctic increased maybe 4-5 degrees, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5134.0s)]
*  on average. So, like a result, ice is melting, permafrost is melting. It means during summer [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5140.64s)]
*  period of time, exist longer periods of times when what sits beneath permafrost, organic matter, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5147.360000000001s)]
*  meets the atmosphere. So, what happened during this period of time? It's the same what happened [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5153.84s)]
*  with your apple when you eat part of it and left it on the table. It's getting rusted, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5158.24s)]
*  how to say it. So, basically, microbes start to work with this organic matter and like a result, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5165.76s)]
*  emission of the greenhouse gases happening. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5173.28s)]
*  It starts to rot. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5175.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So, it's basically either CO2 or if it's very wet, then it will be NH4 maintained. So, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5176.719999999999s)]
*  that is what's happening. So, what I'm saying is that more exposure for organic matter, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5183.04s)]
*  which is underneath permafrost, longer this exposure with atmosphere, more emissions coming [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5190.32s)]
*  out of there. So, that is what's happening now. So, what are the numbers? Actually, it's strange, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5197.44s)]
*  but numbers not well known now. Not so good research exists in this area. It's accelerating [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5202.88s)]
*  but for now, we don't have reliable numbers. There are a number of publications, but differences [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5208.48s)]
*  in measurements are very big. But mostly, estimation will be about 7-8 gigatons of emissions [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5213.28s)]
*  in the, let's say, 10 period of time. So, numbers are like this. It's slightly bigger than the United [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5220.0s)]
*  States anthropogenic emissions. So, basically, it's a significant number which is coming from there. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5226.32s)]
*  So, when we talk about natural-based solution on the permafrost, if I understood the question [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5233.2s)]
*  correctly, the idea is very simple. So, how you can reduce time which organic matter exposes to [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5238.32s)]
*  the atmosphere. How you reduce this time? Basically, you need to keep surface cooler for a little bit [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5246.0s)]
*  longer period of time. That's what you need. And there are a number of techniques how you do it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5252.08s)]
*  There are techniques which you basically apply some things on top of the ice and it melts much [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5257.68s)]
*  slower than it will melt otherwise. There are things which include natural solutions. For example, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5264.88s)]
*  you can put animals in a certain area and when animals are walking in this area, they are [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5271.4400000000005s)]
*  pressuring snow. And what does the snow mean? So, if snow is, let's say, 3 meters, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5279.44s)]
*  then on top of the snow you will have a temperature of maybe minus 40 degrees. But beneath, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5286.96s)]
*  you will have, I don't know, minus 5. It's kind of a blanket. Yes. But if you pressure it, then [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5292.08s)]
*  basically, the temperature beneath the snow will be much less. Like you're walking on your, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5298.48s)]
*  I don't know, country house, let's say, on some walk and you will see that the snow will melt [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5304.88s)]
*  much later than will be snow somewhere else. Exactly. In fact, you can see the footsteps. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5312.0s)]
*  Of course. The ice footsteps, yes. So, like a result, temperature beneath the snow which was [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5319.6s)]
*  pressed by the animals will be lower and like a result, exposure of the surface to the atmosphere [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5326.56s)]
*  during summertime will be shorter. So, no, that's another possible technique. So, in reality, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5334.4s)]
*  these techniques are lying to mitigate quite a lot in terms of the emissions. What kind of animals? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5339.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, what kind of animals love to live in this kind of environment? Reindeer? For example. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5345.44s)]
*  So, many solutions. Is anyone trying that? Yes, people trying. And is there anyone to know whether [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5353.2s)]
*  it works? It definitely works. But again, so, natural-based solution, it's an area where [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5361.12s)]
*  exists very many problems with accounting, with correct measurements and everything. So, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5369.76s)]
*  problem is that we don't have a system which allows us objectively control the flow of the [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5377.2s)]
*  greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and or absorption them from the atmosphere. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5382.96s)]
*  Where is the world's permafrost? 65% of Russian territory permafrost. Alaska is permafrost. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5389.28s)]
*  Yukon, a big part of the Canada, permafrost. And a little bit in Scandinavian countries. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5395.28s)]
*  Those are the four? Big four. Big four. But 65%? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5400.16s)]
*  65% of the Russian national territory is permafrost. Are the Russians trying this? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5405.12s)]
*  Trying to do it. No. Why? Today, basically, why you will do something what doesn't make sense for you. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5410.88s)]
*  Okay, stepping backwards. If warming of the planet is good or bad for Russia, honestly speaking, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5419.28s)]
*  it's rather good than bad for a number of reasons. Of course, some areas will experience maybe [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5427.5199999999995s)]
*  more complicated conditions for agriculture and everything. But on average, our agriculture [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5435.2s)]
*  production will move more north, which will allow to grow more rather than less. In terms of the [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5440.08s)]
*  ability, because we are a northern country, so we spend a lot of energy to allow people to [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5447.52s)]
*  live in this condition. So when temperature going up, no, again, you spend less. So what I'm trying [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5454.16s)]
*  to say, economically, increase of the temperature, actually, it's good in Russia, if you take it [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5460.0s)]
*  in combination of the factors. So why somebody will do something in case it's good for him [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5465.84s)]
*  to do nothing? That's one question. No, it's possible. But then it should be some market [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5472.96s)]
*  for this. So for Russia, it's good. But for somebody, it's bad. Perhaps some arrangement [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5477.84s)]
*  can be done when somebody paying for the basically decrease of certain emissions and use it against [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5484.08s)]
*  their country obligation or something like this. What I'm trying to say, so market is needed. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5490.64s)]
*  Who makes these decisions? United Nations Board exists, so called Paris Agreement, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5497.36s)]
*  and exists a certain bureaucracy, which vacant like part secretariat of this agreement. So today, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5503.599999999999s)]
*  today, that is how it's organized. So today, basically, countries concentrated on the [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5515.839999999999s)]
*  reduction of anthropogenic emissions, but it's perfectly feasible without changing anything in [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5521.68s)]
*  the Paris Agreement to organize two things which is needed. Firstly, to go to the other solution, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5527.68s)]
*  natural base solution with emission, and actually to include Alberta effects also in the consideration, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5535.360000000001s)]
*  like another possible option to affect temperature on the planet. So that can be perfectly done, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5541.6s)]
*  like part of the Paris Agreement. Step number one. And step number two, we need a global market [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5548.0s)]
*  for the carbon. So when basically, because only global market can distribute resources [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5553.6s)]
*  in the best possible way for the when for the unit of economic resource, you can get more value. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5560.0s)]
*  In this case, really, it's how many emission you can cut. So we need two things. One technological [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5568.0s)]
*  neutrality to don't concentrate on the human guild, or but try to do all what works, regardless [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5573.2s)]
*  how you've done it on nature with human. And second, what you need to do, you need to do a [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5581.12s)]
*  world market Paris Agreement in vision world market exists article 6264 of the Paris Agreement, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5585.36s)]
*  but this articles are blocked today and they're not operational. If you were to say to, you know, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5591.5199999999995s)]
*  a leading spokesman for the climate change agenda 2024, whether it was John Kerry or Al Gore, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5599.679999999999s)]
*  Greta Thunberg, actually, what we need to do is put more reindeer on the permafrost, paint the roofs [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5606.0s)]
*  white and plant more forests. How do you think they would respond? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5613.759999999999s)]
*  Firstly, I'm not saying we need to do this or this. I think we need to do whatever. Yeah, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5618.5599999999995s)]
*  whatever. So market should decide. But if you were to make the case you just made on the basis of [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5622.48s)]
*  what emissions actually are and what might I mean, is there a market for these ideas? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5627.92s)]
*  I guess that's what I'm asking. How I said Paris Agreement, it's a creation of the certain [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5632.96s)]
*  historical period. Right. So it was sold to many countries at this time. It was very strongly [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5640.56s)]
*  supported by developing countries of the same. Why, for example, because developing countries [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5646.56s)]
*  did not obligation to cut the emissions. I know that's part of this. Yes. But they expected to [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5651.2s)]
*  receive a lot of support in order to following the agenda, which did not realize at the end. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5656.32s)]
*  So actually it's realized, but in a way that now you can take money for something green, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5661.759999999999s)]
*  but you cannot take money for hospitals, water, or other things, which is important for you, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5667.44s)]
*  because it's the same money. So what I'm trying to say, so basically, movements, any case, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5672.16s)]
*  will move towards the direction where anthropogenic emissions will not be enough. So that is happening [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5679.44s)]
*  any case, firstly, because it's fighting just anthropogenic emissions would not bring us where [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5684.8s)]
*  we want it to be. And second, because this course creates so many uncertainties and [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5690.96s)]
*  disproportionate the world that one by one by one by one, different players will find it [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5697.28s)]
*  that doesn't make sense for them. I noticed. To be part of this agreement. That's what will happen. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5703.52s)]
*  That's why what to say here. So if time coming that this question should be addressed seriously, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5708.32s)]
*  I mean, question of the fighting temperature of the surface, not question of fighting, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5717.759999999999s)]
*  of killing economic activity of the guilty humans. So if question really starting to be [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5723.599999999999s)]
*  addressed seriously, then it's take, of course, strong leader just to say it. What [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5730.32s)]
*  in this leader? It's a question when it will come, but I'm pretty sure it will happen. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5737.52s)]
*  But right now, I mean, there's no lawmaking regulatory political body rational enough to [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5743.84s)]
*  say what you just said, is there? Today, this Paris Agreement process, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5750.0s)]
*  basically run by the bureaucracy. What, how it works, for example, what I told you that article [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5756.080000000001s)]
*  6.2 and 6.4 is blocked. That's a good example. So by whom they block? By Europeans, by European [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5763.12s)]
*  Union. So I explained why it's pretty simple. So price in Europe today, it's 80, about 80 [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5770.4s)]
*  euro per tonne of CO2 reduction. So let's imagine we have a global market where basically you don't [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5778.32s)]
*  need to reduce emission just on the European territory. But when European company can basically [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5785.28s)]
*  buy a reduction, which happened in the places where it's cheaper to do. Let's imagine we're [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5791.36s)]
*  in this market. What will be price of such global market? I would say $30 will be my estimation. So [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5795.759999999999s)]
*  it will be much less. What will happen with the countries which already exhaust the opportunity [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5802.08s)]
*  to cut emission cheaply and brought the economy on the situation when price is 80 euros? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5807.679999999999s)]
*  Let's imagine price tomorrow collapse from 80 euros to $30. What will happen then? Or [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5814.719999999999s)]
*  crisis will happen, huge financial crisis will happen. Because who basically took risks that [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5821.2s)]
*  certain investment will be paid back? Banks or governments? So if price is going down, so [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5827.2s)]
*  basically many renewable sources becoming not competitive compared with fossil fuel sources. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5834.16s)]
*  Because this price of $30 moving prices down. What is the result? Big, big financial crisis. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5841.04s)]
*  So that's why from one side we are talking about how nice it's to fight climate. And from another [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5848.64s)]
*  side we are blocking the best possible mechanism to do it. Because they bet too much on this. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5855.92s)]
*  Exactly. United States not in this situation. United States did not done this bet because it's [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5861.92s)]
*  more rationally run system. United States today basically what it does, it's subsidizing. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5868.72s)]
*  Many producers like part of the inflation reduction act, subsidizing producers, giving [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5876.08s)]
*  money from the federal budget towards companies which is cutting their emissions. Very big money [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5881.68s)]
*  by the way. $100 sometimes per ton of CO2, $80, $110 for certain application. So why you need to [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5887.76s)]
*  spend federal money on something which is like $100 if you can purchase the same for about $10 [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5895.92s)]
*  somewhere else? Where? For example in African country. Why you're not purchasing something [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5903.92s)]
*  what you can purchase for $10 and give jobs and something to the African country but at the same [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5909.68s)]
*  time why you're sending grant money there? Or basically help there? What is it make any sense? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5916.08s)]
*  Why do you think you said at the outset that you think a lot of this is a religious impulse or it [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5924.24s)]
*  follows a religious template where you identify the sin, you find the sinner, you force the [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5929.28s)]
*  sinner to repent and then you get to paradise? Why do you think Western countries which are not [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5934.96s)]
*  religious have chosen that rather than a scientific approach to a scientific problem? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5941.36s)]
*  I mean firstly climate was not the major issue. Climate was a nice slogan to resolve other issues. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5948.719999999999s)]
*  Like for example issue of energy security or issue of the finding new engine for the economic [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5959.759999999999s)]
*  growth. So that was logic number one. Now how you're asking question from other area, cultural [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5965.84s)]
*  question. So how happened basically? The society become so much involved in the process of punishing [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5973.599999999999s)]
*  humans in this process. I don't know. But what's interesting is I personally think energy security [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5982.32s)]
*  is a valuable goal. It's important. But the United States achieved and so after 9-11 you heard people [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5989.2s)]
*  say well these countries are crazy. We can't rely on them. They're driving our foreign policy. We're [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=5996.32s)]
*  getting all these wars because we need their energy. And then the fracking revolution happened in the [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6000.719999999999s)]
*  United States and we were energy secure with gas. We had more gas than we could. We flare it still. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6005.679999999999s)]
*  So why didn't we just declare victory at that point? That's exactly my hope. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6010.719999999999s)]
*  Because there is only one country in the world who can actually change all of this paradigm in [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6018.48s)]
*  the climate agenda. It requires strong leadership and I see only one country in reality who can [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6023.92s)]
*  really do it. And that's the United States. And why this reason can be? Because exactly what you [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6029.92s)]
*  said. So other considerations like energy security etc. basically not a problem for United States [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6035.839999999999s)]
*  anymore. So because it's not a problem. It's not objective reasons to basically go against this [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6042.16s)]
*  trend. You remember President Trump went out of the Paris Agreement when he became a president. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6048.32s)]
*  He suspected that Paris Agreement is not exactly about climate. He suspected that it's kind of the [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6056.4s)]
*  instrument to redistribute working places or investment between different parts of the world [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6063.12s)]
*  and perhaps not for the benefit of the American citizens. So time shows that basically his [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6070.56s)]
*  suspicions were very correct. We spoke some minutes ago about the achievement of China in terms of the [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6077.84s)]
*  electric cars, wind turbines or solar panels. So basically yes, that was like this. So after that, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6084.96s)]
*  when President Biden came back to the White House, he reversed the decision of President Trump. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6095.36s)]
*  And the idea was, of course, because this was a noble goal, still climate crisis needs to be [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6103.28s)]
*  addressed somehow. So that was basically a decision from another side. So that's where we are. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6111.679999999999s)]
*  To be honest, I don't see why something cannot be done which achieves both results at the same time, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6117.76s)]
*  which keeps the United States very much engaged in the process of the global climate agenda from [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6126.72s)]
*  one side, being the leader of the Paris Agreement or any other agreement which may come in its place. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6132.4s)]
*  But at the same time, to propose a solution which is basically beneficial for the whole system [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6139.76s)]
*  specifically for the United States. Because now in the situation of the United States, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6147.04s)]
*  it's not dependent anymore on the import of energy as such. I mean, it's a little bit exported, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6151.4400000000005s)]
*  a little bit imported, but the total balance is good in the United States. So it will be [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6159.04s)]
*  economically much better, from my understanding, for the American economy as a whole, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6165.360000000001s)]
*  to move to the direction where it's not a market which is closed in terms of the carbon market, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6170.4800000000005s)]
*  but an open market where basically American companies can do what they do and find a way [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6176.56s)]
*  how to deal with the emission in the best economically possible way. Either decrease it [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6182.4s)]
*  domestically or go and purchase assets produced in some and other places. So do what American [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6187.6s)]
*  business always know to do the best. Adapt and see better opportunities. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6195.2s)]
*  But I think, I guess I agree with everything you're saying, except I think that this is, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6200.32s)]
*  what we're watching, is less rational than you assume. I think if you said to people, [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6208.24s)]
*  what we're going to do is increase the number of trees and big mammals, which seems to me, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6212.96s)]
*  inherently good, they would say that's not enough punishment for people. They're not suffering [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6218.48s)]
*  enough for their sins. I do think that would be the reaction in the West. Well, what good is that? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6223.76s)]
*  It doesn't hurt us enough. Do you sense that? What I can say. That requires strong leaders to [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6229.52s)]
*  basically move people towards solution rather than towards looking who is guilty. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6243.4400000000005s)]
*  That's required not only in the climate. Why are there no strong leaders in the West anymore? [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6249.5199999999995s)]
*  Because people follow public opinion. They follow what public wants. So they adapt what public wants. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6254.879999999999s)]
*  Strong leader should translate some new senses, should translate innovation. That's what leader [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6264.48s)]
*  means. Give new senses and then make the people understand you. And like this, you move forward. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6271.759999999999s)]
*  Bring the people with you. Don't follow the people. But the West has had leaders like that [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6278.16s)]
*  through history. It has none now, not one that I can see. It's strange when the entire West, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6283.599999999999s)]
*  every leader of every country is weak. It will happen. It always does. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6289.84s)]
*  What's China's actual thinking on climate? So Trump made the case that China is playing us. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6297.44s)]
*  They're benefiting from this. They don't care about the climate, the global temperatures. They [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6302.639999999999s)]
*  care about industrial capacity. They care about their economy. And they're using the Paris Accords [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6306.16s)]
*  to help their economy. What is their thinking on climate, do you think? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6312.8s)]
*  I think they behave like a responsible global power. And today, actually, China in more or less [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6318.24s)]
*  same situation where Europe was some time ago. Basically, energy security also a big issue for [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6325.5199999999995s)]
*  China because a lot of energy imported and also domestic production of energy is mostly calling [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6332.48s)]
*  China. And what's happening with the coal production, the depths of the shafts and everything [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6338.5599999999995s)]
*  increasing because most profitable reserves are getting exhausted. That's why energy security [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6343.2s)]
*  is getting an issue for China. So that's why for them to build more and more renewables, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6349.44s)]
*  it makes perfect sense from their perspective because they deal with two problems, not only [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6355.599999999999s)]
*  with the climate. And that's perfectly competitive, how to say. It's perfectly aligned with what [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6361.2s)]
*  Western countries do today. So for them, renewables is needed. For them, energy transition is needed [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6368.32s)]
*  because firstly, they need it for their energy security. And second, they're really able to [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6374.72s)]
*  create new industries in a very fast and very organized manner because their system allows to [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6381.44s)]
*  concentrate resources on strategic goals maybe faster than normal market economy would do. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6389.76s)]
*  So they can establish a group of the industries, call them champions, support these industries by [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6396.88s)]
*  all government means. And perhaps these industries can take a global leading position much faster. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6402.8s)]
*  That is what's happening in China. So yes, the insight of this paradigm of the fighting of the [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6408.4800000000005s)]
*  fossil fuels. Yes, they have their reason why it works for them. But at the same time, China [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6415.6s)]
*  also doing a lot, today it's the biggest actually contributor to natural-based projects. How is it? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6423.120000000001s)]
*  They plant most of the trees than other countries did in order to offset emissions. The Chinese [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6429.04s)]
*  company looking on the other markets in order to do projects that offset their home emissions. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6434.64s)]
*  So I think they are doing pretty well, pretty logical from there. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6440.0s)]
*  Does coal have a future? Will people be burning coal in 50 years? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6444.24s)]
*  I think so. I think so. Because again, it's nothing bad to use any fossil fuels, especially [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6447.76s)]
*  if you can offset emissions out of it. I would say that emissions from the coal, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6455.04s)]
*  again, maybe I even need to step back one step before. So people sometimes mix between ecology [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6463.84s)]
*  and climate. So ecology is something that pollutes. It's, I don't know, dirty rivers. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6471.84s)]
*  The particulates. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6476.72s)]
*  It's something of this. Can modern coal power plants deal with these questions? Yes. Yes. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6477.4400000000005s)]
*  Modern coal power plants don't produce black smoke and they don't destroy nature like previous [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6484.64s)]
*  generation of coal power plants used to do before. So answering on these questions, yes, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6491.76s)]
*  ecology can be basically resolved. Question number one. Another question, it's emissions. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6497.76s)]
*  So let's imagine the global price is $20. In this case, coal will fly forever. If the global price [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6503.52s)]
*  will be, I don't know, $30, $40, that will create a little bit different scenario. So in reality, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6510.4800000000005s)]
*  it's nothing wrong to emit when you produce something, be it from the natural gas or from [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6517.28s)]
*  the coal or whatever. As long as you can offset. And if price of offset is low, no, it gives [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6522.24s)]
*  particular types of the fossil fuels longer future, then it will be a different scenario. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6528.48s)]
*  What about natural gas? I mean, the emissions from natural gas are much lower, correct? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6534.88s)]
*  Also, it's not black and white. So natural gas is NH4. It's methane. Yes. So methane and CO2, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6541.12s)]
*  it's two different greenhouse gases. So question is, how you compare, let's say, harm caused by [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6548.96s)]
*  one greenhouse gas versus harm caused by another greenhouse gas. It sounds like a simple question, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6557.04s)]
*  but actually it's not. Why? Because molecular of CO2 when it sits in atmosphere, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6563.2s)]
*  your half lifetime will be much longer than half lifetime of the molecular of methane. So what it [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6568.96s)]
*  means? It means you have 100 molecules of methane in the atmosphere. Seven years after, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6575.28s)]
*  it will be 50 molecules remain in the atmosphere. With the coal, basically it will take, let's say, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6580.08s)]
*  100 years before half life will be achieved, something about 100 years. That's why you don't [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6584.8s)]
*  have a clear answer on how harmful it's one molecular versus another molecular. So how you [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6590.4s)]
*  can answer now on this question? So if you take a period of time, let's say 100 years, today number [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6598.32s)]
*  is 32. It means one molecular of methane more harmful in terms of the global warming than one [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6604.0s)]
*  molecular of CO2 32 times, but it's on the period of time 100 years. But if you take not 100 years, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6610.48s)]
*  but 30 years, numbers will be very different. Number is 83. So during this period of time, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6617.68s)]
*  molecular of methane more harmful than molecular of CO2 on another number. You understand the logic? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6624.96s)]
*  Because half life is very different. That's why, so if price, if basically you use a ratio of 32 [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6631.84s)]
*  on the 100 years time, and if your goal is to equalize two harms on the 100 years term, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6638.8s)]
*  then most of the basically power plant which is running on the gas will be better than power [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6646.56s)]
*  plant running on coal. Coal will die. But if you're trying to orient basically on the shorter period [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6652.96s)]
*  of time, like 30 years, what, for example, that is something what interesting to you. Opposite [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6660.8s)]
*  will be the true. That's why it's not so simple question. Well, given how hard it is to measure [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6666.72s)]
*  even something that straightforward, it seems straightforward. How do we know what global [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6672.16s)]
*  temperatures are doing? Approximately. Approximately. So basically, this measure is pretty good right now. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6677.76s)]
*  So that you can do. You have satellites, you have a certain network of the things in the oceans. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6687.280000000001s)]
*  Is sea level rising? Apparently so. It's what? Looks like. Looks like. In some places rising, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6694.08s)]
*  in some places getting probably a little bit less, but on average in the planet definitely rising. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6702.96s)]
*  You hear that this is going to unleash a series of catastrophes on humanity. Do you believe that? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6710.32s)]
*  There are certain reverse loops. So, and we don't understand how exactly they will work. So when [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6721.679999999999s)]
*  surface of the planet is heating, for example, ice, it's melting. When ice is melting, [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6729.599999999999s)]
*  more emissions coming underneath of this ice if it's permafrost. Or, for example, more water vapor [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6735.44s)]
*  coming in case if it was ice on top of the oceans. That increases the effect of the heating once [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6741.839999999999s)]
*  again because all of these gases coming to atmosphere. So certain loops exist. Exist other [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6750.16s)]
*  loops in the climate system. So where is the big danger sits? Danger is we don't really know. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6755.5199999999995s)]
*  The system is so complicated. The total balance in the atmosphere is so complicated that we don't [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6762.72s)]
*  really know what can be what they call tipping point. A moment when the system will start to [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6768.400000000001s)]
*  behave abnormally. When number of events, not good events, will start to increase faster than it's [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6773.360000000001s)]
*  doing now. So we don't know it for sure. We don't know it for sure. So again, there are people who [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6781.12s)]
*  believe and there are people who learn. So of course, more complex question you go, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6787.6s)]
*  amount of believers becoming much bigger than amount of the learners. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6793.76s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? Why not just admit that? Why don't leaders just say there's some [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6800.160000000001s)]
*  things we don't understand. They're very complex and there are too many variables and we don't [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6804.88s)]
*  really know where this is going. But we're concerned. Why not just be straightforward with [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6808.0s)]
*  the global population rather than predicting in a way that's impossible to really know what's [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6811.76s)]
*  going to happen? Simplicity. People learn to do very simple messages and to admit that you [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6818.96s)]
*  don't know something doesn't sound like a very strong message, right? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6826.16s)]
*  Yes, but don't you just credit yourself? It's hard to believe you when you lie a lot. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6832.4800000000005s)]
*  And it does have a counterproductive effect. I mean, if they're telling me that the Maldives [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6837.68s)]
*  won't exist, you know what I mean? It's like, but they still exist. I just don't believe you after [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6844.240000000001s)]
*  a while. Don't they destroy their credibility talking like that? Apparently not. You see, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6850.240000000001s)]
*  wealth is still working and people still think that basically what they heard, it makes perfect [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6857.200000000001s)]
*  sense. So last question, which I really don't understand, but climate protesters in Europe [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6864.32s)]
*  have been destroying in Renaissance paintings, no modern art, but all Christian art, [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6871.04s)]
*  in the name of ending climate change. How do you get from a concern about global [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6878.08s)]
*  temperatures to destroying art? What is that? It's a way to express yourself. Why certain people in [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6882.08s)]
*  the certain moments of change, choosing to express themselves in this way, how do I know [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6888.4s)]
*  that's a realm of another science? I'm not specialist in psychiatry or other types of [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6893.12s)]
*  that. But you'll admit there's something very deep going on here. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6899.68s)]
*  When there are too many changes happening in the very short period of time, it increases basically [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6907.04s)]
*  stress in the humans. When stress in the humans increases, the stress goes to very different [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6914.16s)]
*  manifestations. So maybe it's not so bad that global warming, chosen like big enemy, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6921.68s)]
*  which we need to fight. Just a little bit change the angle. Are we beginning a change period or [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6929.76s)]
*  are we in the middle of it or are we coming to the end of a change period globally? We are starting. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6937.4400000000005s)]
*  We're starting. We are starting. Yeah, we are starting. Most dangerous time of year. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6942.88s)]
*  On that happy note, Andrey Milchenko, thank you. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL6YDtAAB8&t=6948.4800000000005s)]
