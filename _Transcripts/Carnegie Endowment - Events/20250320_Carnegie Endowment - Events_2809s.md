Video Description: All Presidents, Jonathan Alter wrote, are blind dates. Donald Trump may be the first who isn’t. Political analysts and historians not only have Trump’s first term to gauge his temperament and policies, but the four years preceding the 2024 elections, where he previewed his agenda for his second non-consecutive term. Even with that foreshadowing, Trump has crashed through traditional norms and conventions, aggrandized presidential power, and sought to reshape American politics in ways few would have thought possible. 

What lessons does history hold for us in approaching the second Trump presidency? Is it plausible to talk about the age of Trump as historians have done for certain presidents? The American experiment in democratic self-governance has been tested in the past. How will it fare going forward? Indeed, will the traditional guardrails hold and protect against the abuse of presidential power? Join Aaron David Miller as he engages in conversation with presidential historians Nicole Hemmer and Douglas Brinkley to discuss these and other issues, on the next Carnegie Connects.

# Assessing Trump’s Presidency: Two Historians Reflect on the Past and Future
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc)
*  Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you are in this wonderful world of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=0.0s)]
*  ours. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=16.0s)]
*  I hope you are truly safe and healthy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=17.0s)]
*  I'm Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  and welcome to Carnegie Connects, a series of conversations on issues of critical importance [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=22.64s)]
*  to America and to the world. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=27.06s)]
*  I'm truly pleased and excited today to welcome to the program two outstanding historians [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=30.06s)]
*  for discussion of the Trump presidency, past, present, and future. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=37.1s)]
*  I'm a historian by training, although I got off that highway decades ago into matters [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=44.82s)]
*  more current, but I've always retained an extraordinary affection and respect for historians [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=50.3s)]
*  and what the lessons of history can teach us. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=57.74s)]
*  With Mark Twain, I guess, and I'm not sure exactly what he meant when he said that history [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=63.14s)]
*  rhymes rather than repeats, but I've always been compelled by looking for the, I guess [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=67.38s)]
*  to quote Twain, the rhythmic patterns of the past and what they hold for us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=73.42s)]
*  It may seem a bit odd 60 days into the Trump presidency to be bringing two extraordinary [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=79.46s)]
*  historians to discuss that presidency, but again, with all due respect to Jonathan Alter, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=84.78s)]
*  who described or asserted that all presidents were blind dates, I'm not sure that's really [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=90.58s)]
*  true in the case of this particular president. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=96.02s)]
*  We have a first Trump administration. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=98.86s)]
*  We have four years of intervening previews and a fair set of cautionary tales and warnings, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=101.58s)]
*  I suspect, on what a Trump 45 would do if he became a Trump 47. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=113.42s)]
*  Still, I approach the subject with great humility and caution. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=120.42s)]
*  It's early days to be sure. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=124.82s)]

*  And the conservative revolutionaries who remade American politics in the 1990s. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=158.14000000000001s)]

*  Nicky and Doug, welcome to Carnegie Connects. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=186.66s)]
*  I want to divide our conversation today into three parts. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  Number one, what can history tell us about Trump and his presidency against the backdrop [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  of his predecessors and the office? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=199.38s)]
*  Second, how would you assess the Trump presidency 60 days in terms of style and substance, again, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=202.22s)]
*  comparatively speaking, with previous occupants of the Oval? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=209.66s)]
*  And then finally, in the riskiest of endeavors, I will push historians where they definitely [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=213.66s)]
*  do not like to go. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=218.94s)]
*  What of the future? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=221.82s)]
*  The office, the country? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=223.18s)]
*  What might today's headlines portend about future trend lines? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=225.08s)]
*  So let's jump right in. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=229.46s)]
*  Doug, to you first. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=230.46s)]
*  Where does Trump fit in the presidential pantheon? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=232.94s)]
*  I'm not looking for rankings. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=237.38s)]
*  I wrote a book on the end of greatness in the presidency. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=238.38s)]
*  I've got my own notion pretty well fixed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=241.98s)]
*  But what about previous presidential models? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=245.05999999999997s)]
*  What does history tell us about Donald Trump? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=248.61999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, the only time I've had a sustained conversation with Donald Trump was after he [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  won the presidency the first time and I was with CNN. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=257.18s)]
*  I got to go to Amaralago and only talk to him about past presidents. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=261.41999999999996s)]
*  And the ground rules was I wasn't allowed to write about it, but he was thinking about [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  what he would do for his inaugural address. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=270.5s)]
*  And he said he knew nothing about past history. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  He never read a book about a Lincoln. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=276.14s)]
*  And it startled me because, you know, when you talk to politicians, they even make up [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  books. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  They pretend they read a lot. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  And he just kind of shrugged it off and told me that he was a visual guy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  That translated his sense of history in a true sense. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=290.41999999999996s)]
*  It began with John F. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=295.26s)]
*  Kennedy, who he thought still had some gas in his tank, as he put it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=296.06s)]
*  He liked the idea. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=301.5s)]
*  I had written about American moonshot going to the moon and he said, it's good for the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=302.86s)]
*  spirit, meaning moon and Mars. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=306.82s)]
*  And we're going to plant the flags there like Musk has been saying. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  And then he had nothing good to say about LBJ. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  He told me a very funny story about Jimmy Carter, who he learned to only like. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=317.7s)]
*  He trashed Carter all the time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  But Carter came for the Carter Center to his office in New York with Secret Service and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=325.70000000000005s)]
*  tried to shake Trump down for some money for the Carter Center. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  And Carter said, I finally Trump told me I finally learned how Carter became president. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=334.98s)]
*  That's a lot of audacity. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=339.5s)]
*  I'm trapping him all the time. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=340.74s)]
*  And now Carter's coming to me with that smile saying I want some money. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  Of course, Trump didn't give him any. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=346.22s)]
*  The key is why he said Ronald Reagan, I want to represent in style. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=349.42s)]
*  But Reagan was a terrible negotiator. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  And otherwise he liked Reagan. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=357.7s)]
*  But Nixon was really his guy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=359.98s)]
*  He grew up with Nixon. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=362.98s)]
*  He saw in 1972 Nixon won the biggest landslide in American history. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=364.3s)]
*  As we all know, Roger Stone walks around with his Nixon tattoo on his back. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=369.42s)]
*  And he had told me that he would go out regularly with Nixon. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=375.42s)]
*  There's a connect there with Roy Cohen, famous lawyer that worked with Joe McCarthy and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=378.5s)]
*  Nixon. And so he thought that Nixon had just won the biggest landslide and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=383.06s)]
*  made a mistake handing over the tapes, made a mistake of subjecting himself to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=387.46s)]
*  the Watergate indignities. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=392.46s)]
*  And he would never do such a thing that he had that that was the one big mistake of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=394.62s)]
*  Nixon. And so I would take that he grabs a lot out of Nixon. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=399.5s)]
*  But he also learned how George Wallace used race to divide America. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=403.5s)]
*  He learned how Joe McCarthy, he's always been a PT Barnum showman figure. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=408.1s)]
*  He learned a lot out of out of Atlantic City and in Las Vegas, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=414.62s)]
*  how Americans like to gamble. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=418.82000000000005s)]
*  He's learned a lot about more than all of us on this program, I'm sure, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=420.18s)]
*  about World Federation Wrestling and stock car racing and all, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=426.1s)]
*  meaning sports extreme and that business of what franchising means. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=431.14000000000004s)]
*  When he isn't as a president or a leader, he's a combination of a lot of things. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=437.62s)]
*  And he took up Ross Perot's 19 percent of 1992 anti NAFTA. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=442.46s)]
*  But he he he he rift and it's all just against elites in the establishment. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=449.1s)]
*  So if you're correctly going to call me populist. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=455.18s)]
*  Yes, he's heard some things about Andrew Jackson. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=458.1s)]
*  He likes recently he's heard some things about tariffs and William McKinley. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=460.66s)]
*  He likes hence getting rid of the name Denali and in Alaska, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=465.3s)]
*  it's the national park and putting McKinley's name back on it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=470.62s)]
*  And he's gotten in now, I think, to spheres of influence, 19th century thinking. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=473.78s)]
*  He's learned Manipal's destiny, Monroe doctrine, Panama Canal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=479.09999999999997s)]
*  And so you're almost going now to it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=484.09999999999997s)]
*  We're too often media puts looks at the 1930s Charles Lindbergh because they take [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=485.9s)]
*  the phrase, make America great, and then they connect. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=491.09999999999997s)]
*  But really, he wants to go back in many ways pre Woodrow Wilson, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=493.9s)]
*  get it where the federal government in the monetary system doesn't play a big role [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=498.17999999999995s)]
*  and at least have the theater Roosevelt big stick. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=503.78s)]
*  But you know, and try to be a peacemaker if he can. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  Last thing I'll say is there's no record of Trump looking to have blood on his hands, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=510.7s)]
*  looking to send it of trans groups abroad. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=514.66s)]
*  But he's a bizarre one offer that you cannot really honestly connect to any of our [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=518.74s)]
*  previous presidents, so many who got their leadership skills serving in the US military. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=525.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Nick, Nick, to you, I was I mean, that's I mean, Doug Doug's insight [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=530.58s)]
*  suggest how Trump looks at the past and borrows from a number of of previous occupants of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  the Oval Office. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=542.7800000000001s)]
*  So in the end, is history really does history help hurt? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=544.14s)]
*  And there are false historical analogies which we need to be very wary of. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=549.3s)]
*  Does it hurt help or is it a wash when it comes to this particular president? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=553.22s)]
*  Is he so outside the box of previous presidents in our history, both in style and substance, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=559.8199999999999s)]
*  that that it really it's a historical or non-historical? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=566.3s)]
*  I ultimately think history is useful in helping us understand Trump, both because it helps [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=571.58s)]
*  us to understand which parts of Trumpism and of Trump's presidency have precedent or even [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=576.5s)]
*  kind of within the range of normal for previous presidents. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=583.98s)]
*  And that helps us better understand the parts that aren't. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=587.98s)]
*  You know, when I think of especially Trump's second term, there are parts of it that do [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  some precedents that don't strain the analogy too much. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=597.1s)]
*  You know, his focus on vengeance as a big part of his presidency is something that we saw in [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=602.1s)]
*  people like the two presidency admirers, Andrew Jackson and Richard Nixon. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=607.26s)]
*  Vengeance was part of the fuel of those presidencies when those two men took office. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=611.98s)]
*  And even in his embrace of insurrection, there is precedent for that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=617.5400000000001s)]
*  You look at somebody like Andrew Johnson, who became president after Abraham Lincoln was [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=622.18s)]
*  assassinated and really reached out to the insurrectionists who had gone to war against the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=626.38s)]
*  United States. He worked to move very quickly to reconstruct the southern states. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=632.8199999999999s)]
*  He gave pardons to Confederate officers who really wanted to welcome those insurrectionists and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=637.86s)]
*  traitors back into the U.S. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=643.26s)]
*  body politic in the way that Donald Trump has done with January 6th rioters. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=645.06s)]
*  And I think that understanding that context helps us see the other big part of his presidency, the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=650.66s)]
*  consolidation of power in the executive, which he has moved very quickly to do on his second term. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=656.9s)]
*  I don't see a domestic precedent for that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=663.98s)]
*  And that's how I find history very useful and illuminating, you know, what is within the realm [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=667.02s)]
*  of history and what is something that is new and and I think worth paying quite a lot of [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=673.38s)]
*  attention to. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=680.26s)]
*  Yeah. You know, Michael Kazin, historian writing in 2015, wondered whether we're missing [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=681.22s)]
*  something by focusing on the individual. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=691.86s)]
*  To your point, Nikki, about Trumpism, could each of you take a moment and and look back in an effort [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=694.86s)]
*  to tell us what are the elements do you think historical elements within American society and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=701.9s)]
*  politics and culture that have given rise not to Trump, but to Trumpism? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=709.06s)]
*  I'm going to ask you later because historians love to describe things in terms of ages and eras, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=715.54s)]
*  whether it's too early to talk about the age of Donald Trump. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=721.5s)]
*  But I just wonder what are the elements that define from our past that that provide continuity in [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=725.4599999999999s)]
*  explaining Trump's rise? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=734.6199999999999s)]
*  Doug, first to you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=736.42s)]
*  Well, I would recommend reading if people haven't Richard Hofstadter's. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=738.38s)]
*  I knew you were going to. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=743.3s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's a classic helps helps you get thinking in that way, meaning you can sell fear and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=745.06s)]
*  paranoia in America. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=751.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, look at what you long did in Louisiana against FDR or Father Coughlin up in Michigan. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=753.06s)]
*  Look at people. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=760.62s)]
*  You know, we're deeply trying to destroy FDR. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=761.86s)]
*  I mean, we talk about Trump being shot in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=764.86s)]
*  I mean, there's an assassination attempt on Franklin Roosevelt in Miami just weeks before he was [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=768.1400000000001s)]
*  sworn in. And it actually killed the mayor of John Sherman. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=774.3000000000001s)]
*  And FDR had to go to the hospital with blood all over him, holding the dying mayor's head. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=779.5s)]
*  And yeah, it's in. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=784.6600000000001s)]
*  And but FDR was preaching optimism in our worst time of economic despair. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=786.1s)]
*  And you're seeing Trump going to this nihilism or despair, making people afraid of their own [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=792.42s)]
*  shadow that America is going to crumble without him. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=799.2199999999999s)]
*  He's a demagogue. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=803.38s)]
*  And we've had Joe McCarthy was, however, only a U.S. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=804.6999999999999s)]
*  Senator from Wisconsin and eventually the U.S. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=809.66s)]
*  Army under President Eisenhower squashed McCarthy. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=812.8199999999999s)]
*  But in Trump's case, he is a billionaire who's mobilized a lot of power. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=816.02s)]
*  And what makes it difficult for Nicole and I to do the comparisons of this moment is we are now in the era [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=821.62s)]
*  of A.I. and the technology world that no other president had. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=828.7s)]
*  I mean, when Bill Clinton was became president, nobody sent an email in 1993. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=833.86s)]
*  It was not being used by the end of Clinton's presidency. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=838.7s)]
*  There are like a billion emails bouncing around the world of technology. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=842.1s)]
*  There's no I don't know the history of email. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=846.5s)]
*  I'm going to go to the library and pull it off the shelf. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=848.58s)]
*  It's not been done yet in the right way. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=850.62s)]
*  So I've been really a good history of faxing. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=852.66s)]
*  But stuff keeps going so fast. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=855.18s)]
*  And when you have Elon Musk partnering with with Trump in this way, it puts too easy to [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=857.5s)]
*  pronounce celebrities. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=864.02s)]
*  Trump, Musk holding that we're cutting government. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=865.5s)]
*  And they really are in a anti-federal government mode. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=868.62s)]
*  They do not like Uncle Sam, U.S. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=872.98s)]
*  government, except for some carve out with defense. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=875.34s)]
*  And that is all Republicans since Reagan want less government, less taxes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=879.14s)]
*  But none of them have jumped the shark in this direction where you're willy nilly taking [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=885.66s)]
*  a wrecking ball to the EPA or Department of Education or have your pick. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=890.1s)]
*  Right. I would combine that anti-federal government with anti-constitutional. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=895.5s)]
*  And it's the anti-constitutionalism that makes it makes it feel new. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=899.46s)]
*  And Doug's right to point out that there are all of these ways in which the Trump [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=903.02s)]
*  presidency feels very modern. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=907.14s)]
*  You would add to a reality television. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=909.34s)]
*  And Doug mentioned all these different ideas about celebrity that have come of age in [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=912.86s)]
*  recent years. And Donald Trump is the first real social media president. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=918.1s)]
*  And so you have those novelties that are associated with the Trump presidency. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=922.3s)]
*  But I think it's worth lingering on that era that Doug pointed out earlier, which is [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=927.18s)]
*  the 1890s. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=931.26s)]
*  I think so many of the threads that particularly the second Trump administration is tugging [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=933.02s)]
*  on are 1890s ideas. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=938.86s)]
*  You think of the 1890s as this period of an enormous gap between rich and poor, where [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=942.7s)]
*  the idea was that if you had a ton of money, that was a sign that you were a good person, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=948.58s)]
*  a smart person, the kind of person who should run a country. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=953.46s)]
*  You had the Supreme Court very much on the side of business, rolling back regulations [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=957.02s)]
*  you had an extractive industries like coal that were the main drivers of the of the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=962.9399999999999s)]
*  economy. And so I think that there is this sense combined with the American imperialism [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=968.26s)]
*  of the era that is coming through in strong ways with Donald Trump and where we might [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=974.58s)]
*  have talked about the 1950s when we talked about Make America Great Again in his first [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=978.42s)]
*  term. I think thinking in terms of the 1890s is probably going to be more useful in the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=982.9s)]
*  second term. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=988.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, neither of you referred to another continuous theme throughout American [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=988.94s)]
*  history, which the Trump administration clearly rode to probably both electoral successes. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=996.6600000000001s)]
*  And that is the anti-immigration theme, which has been so resonant on the negative side [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1004.86s)]
*  throughout our history. It's also interesting to note that Trump is presiding over the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1011.0600000000001s)]
*  the largest number of JFK assassination documents back to the issue of the paranoid. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1015.82s)]
*  So I don't know whether that's an irony. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1022.62s)]
*  A president who revels in conspiracy theories and enables them is now releasing documents [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1025.74s)]
*  to disprove, although I doubt if it will, the conspiracy theories that surround the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1033.5s)]
*  death of Jack Kennedy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1039.9s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, Nicole, you did mention the notion of the 1890s. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1042.62s)]
*  I think about this a lot. It troubles me a lot. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1047.3s)]
*  Is there another era or decade in the American experience that even comes close to rivaling [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1051.5s)]
*  the sort of stresses and strains that we're now witnessing in American society politics? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1066.3s)]
*  I mean, apart, obviously, from civil war. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1074.8999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned the Gilded Age. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1077.7s)]
*  Doug, let me ask you, is the 60s at all relevant here? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1080.42s)]
*  The 1960s? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1086.6599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1087.8999999999999s)]
*  Oh, of course. I mean, I call it the long 60s, 1960 to 1973. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1089.3400000000001s)]
*  And that was the great wave of victories for liberalism, progressivism. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1096.7800000000002s)]
*  You had people like Rachel Carson talking about the need to regulate chemicals. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1102.0600000000002s)]
*  The government is poisoning your children in their backyard, connecting the environment [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1106.9s)]
*  with public health. You had Ralph Nader out there, you know, unsafe at any speed and going [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1110.8200000000002s)]
*  after safety industries, I mean, auto industries. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1115.82s)]
*  The point being, it became regulating. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1119.8999999999999s)]
*  If you look at what particularly Lyndon Johnson and even Nixon who created, you know, EPA [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1122.7s)]
*  and Clean Air Acts, Water Acts, this performative action, there was a regulation of that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1128.1s)]
*  people were going to regulate and there was consumer activism that died around the time [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1133.78s)]
*  of Watergate. It was became a casualty of three things. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1139.1799999999998s)]
*  The Arab oil embargo and kind of the oil industry energy catching up to how many wins [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1143.66s)]
*  the environmentalists, conservationists had won. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1150.7800000000002s)]
*  It scored points because Nixon was failing in Watergate. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1154.3400000000001s)]
*  In many of the hard right of today, Maggaret did not like Nixon cooperating with, you know, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1159.0200000000002s)]
*  Nixon was all about himself and legacy, starting his second term. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1165.74s)]
*  He did started like 71 to start signing, kind of some could call Nixon the last New Deal [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1169.58s)]
*  liberal, if you want. And but they thought he betrayed him, meaning as a reaction to [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1175.54s)]
*  the 60s, long 60s, you get the birth of things like Cato Institute, AEI, you know, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1182.74s)]
*  Koch brothers, the power, empowering of Hoover Institute and much more. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1191.5s)]
*  It just grows because their main goal is to defend chambers of commerce, capitalism and [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1199.18s)]
*  have companies and corporations be the power and in some of this hyper regulatory [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1206.9s)]
*  environment that particularly Lyndon Johnson and Nixon did. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1214.06s)]
*  Kennedy didn't do as much. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1220.1s)]
*  Kennedy wanted to lower taxes. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1221.86s)]
*  He didn't he didn't do he was debating. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1223.82s)]
*  Do I go space, John, if Kennedy and poor money into NASA or do I do poverty? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1226.06s)]
*  He went space. But Kennedy did do integration and famously and, you know, with James [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1230.22s)]
*  Meredith, that Ole Miss or his important speeches on civil rights. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1236.4199999999998s)]
*  And that burned a lot of the South that Kennedy was doing integration and trying to kill [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1239.94s)]
*  Jim Crow. But it's really the aim of the Trump movement is to wipe out the legislation of [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1244.3400000000001s)]
*  Johnson, Nixon. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1249.98s)]
*  The problem is Medicaid and Medicare are popular and they dare talk about Social Security. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1251.3400000000001s)]
*  You watch them sink in the polls. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1256.94s)]
*  So we'll have to see if those three in particular hold firm and can't really be messed [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1258.42s)]
*  with much. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1264.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good transition, I think, to the present. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1265.06s)]
*  But I want to ask you both. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1269.1s)]
*  Nick, you're in Nashville. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1272.22s)]
*  Doug, you're at Rice. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1275.46s)]
*  I mean, I'm sitting in Washington, ground zero and have for more than 40 years. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1276.94s)]
*  And the feeling I get, the sense, the ethos is one of of I mean, I hate to use this word [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1284.26s)]
*  because it's overused. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1293.34s)]
*  The sense I get is of crisis. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1296.3s)]
*  And I just wonder if neither of you sit at ground zero, but is is that your sense as we [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1300.1399999999999s)]
*  move to try to assess 60 days of the actions and policies of the 47th president of the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1308.1s)]
*  United States? Are we in a crisis? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1319.78s)]
*  I would I would say yes. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1322.6599999999999s)]
*  And the fact that Doug and I both stood at universities may have given us a special window [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1324.34s)]
*  into how quickly that crisis has escalated. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1329.1399999999999s)]
*  You've seen universities directly under attack by the president, both in cutting all kinds [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1332.1799999999998s)]
*  of funding for health research and scientific research that has blown a hole in the budgets [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1338.2199999999998s)]
*  of a lot of different universities, new regulations on what kinds of words you can use on [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1343.58s)]
*  your websites, scrubbing and the firing of offices dedicated to diversity, equity, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1348.46s)]
*  inclusion and accessibility and ongoing wars, particular universities like Columbia and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1355.94s)]
*  Johns Hopkins and University of Pennsylvania that are being stripped of hundreds of millions [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1361.82s)]
*  of dollars. And that has had a chaotic effect on universities so far, and it will likely [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1366.7s)]
*  have a catastrophic effect on them. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1372.98s)]
*  Now, that is one slice of the US economy and of US institutions. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1375.26s)]
*  It is not the entire crisis, but I think it is one that we certainly feel very acutely [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1380.7s)]
*  here in Nashville. And of course, because we live in a very connected world, we're also [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1385.38s)]
*  witnessing the destruction of institutions that are happening in D.C. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1389.5800000000002s)]
*  as well, including institutions that we as historians and scholars use. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1393.26s)]
*  I mean, the Woodrow Wilson Institution in Washington, D.C. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1396.78s)]
*  has been a vital source for understanding the Cold War. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1400.54s)]
*  It has been a place where historians of US foreign policy have gone to study the world and [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1403.94s)]
*  and explore and examine US foreign policy. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1409.66s)]
*  And that's being stripped to the bones as we speak. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1413.82s)]
*  So I think that in most areas of US society, the crisis is coming home in one way or the other. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1416.14s)]
*  To dug over to you on the issue of crisis, I mean, we have had crises in American history [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1424.26s)]
*  before, hot, irrepressible crises that encumbered the entire nation or the nation as it [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1429.42s)]
*  existed, leading up to the Civil War and even beyond. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1436.42s)]
*  Is that your sense as well that this is a crisis? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1441.18s)]
*  Well, I often like to tell students that the point of history is to remind ourselves that our [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1446.02s)]
*  own time isn't uniquely oppressive because we're living particularly in the new cycle [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1451.8600000000001s)]
*  that we do. It seems like every the roofs caving in every second. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1457.74s)]
*  But I have to say the Civil War stands in a different category. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1462.26s)]
*  I mean, when Lincoln gets into Washington and, you know, the have he wasn't even on the ballot [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1466.66s)]
*  Lincoln in southern states and there's a beehive of secession in Maryland and Virginia. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1472.5s)]
*  The Battle of Bull Run, the first battle in Virginia that Confederates won. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1478.6200000000001s)]
*  That's around where Dulles Airport is today. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1483.1s)]
*  So the Civil War era is much worse. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1486.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you have eight hundred thousand dead Americans. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1488.82s)]
*  But since then, this may be the most crisis, raw time. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1492.42s)]
*  I mean, Cuban Missile Crisis had 13 days where we're worried about, will there be a nuclear [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1496.18s)]
*  showdown? We've had a couple. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1501.06s)]
*  We've had these tense peaks before. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1502.8999999999999s)]
*  But this is four years of undoing of the federal government, of turning the clock back to the [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1505.42s)]
*  robber bearer era. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1511.74s)]
*  And the robber bearers got their comeuppance when McKinley was replaced by Theodore Roosevelt. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1513.42s)]
*  And from 1901 to 1909, Theodore Roosevelt carried the flag for the federal government [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1522.06s)]
*  forward that we are what is America? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1527.14s)]
*  It's us. It's you that the best Americans are people that are farming and that are working [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1529.42s)]
*  hard and that are paying taxes and the armed forces. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1534.66s)]
*  And we're going to have public lands. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1537.98s)]
*  So we're going to you know, he was a great reformer. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1539.58s)]
*  So the Democrats have to create an opposition to Trump, which they're they're you know, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1542.6599999999999s)]
*  they're they're close to, but they can't figure out a formula. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1547.1399999999999s)]
*  So what do we have? We are in, I think, on the verge of a crisis or in the middle of it, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1550.1399999999999s)]
*  perhaps. And we got less than two years for a midterm election. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1555.02s)]
*  The Democrats have to win Congress. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1560.54s)]
*  Meantime, a lot of executive orders Trump's are signing and he's doing them willy nilly [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1562.82s)]
*  since day one are being dismissed in courts. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1567.3s)]
*  They may be challenged. We'll see. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1570.18s)]
*  Some is going to get through. This is a very dramatic time. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1572.14s)]
*  But as we've seen, Chief Justice Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett look like they're not going [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1575.42s)]
*  to be Trump rubber stamps. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1580.34s)]
*  So I'm disturbed. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1582.26s)]
*  Dei University. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1583.74s)]
*  But I don't want to repeat because I agree. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1585.46s)]
*  But also the way Trump has gone after federal judges in this unseemly way and the way he's [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1587.74s)]
*  stripping security from Joe Biden's kids, the meanness and the pettiness and the horror [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1593.26s)]
*  that of the way he treats people Trump. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1601.74s)]
*  And I know he feels it's revenge. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1604.5s)]
*  I used to tell on television a long time ago, but I believe it to be true. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1607.54s)]
*  Trump loves Al Capone. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1612.54s)]
*  I mean, Capone became the hero of America because he went against the prohibition. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1614.1399999999999s)]
*  The government was saying you can't drink. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1620.98s)]
*  Capone said, yes, you can. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1623.9399999999998s)]
*  And it was a symbol Al Capone of resistance to prohibition. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1626.06s)]
*  You're seeing Trump now resisting the federal governments, the mores, the standards, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1629.5s)]
*  the institutions, and it doesn't bode well for the European Union. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1634.46s)]
*  I think NATO will get through all of this. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1638.62s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen in Ukraine. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1641.5s)]
*  So it's going to be it's at its best. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1644.3s)]
*  Trump's going to have to pull some rabbits out of his hat in big, big diplomacy with [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1647.22s)]
*  Russia and China and try to solve some issues. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1651.8200000000002s)]
*  And the only thing that keeps me hopeful is, you know, we've had presidents that poor [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1654.8200000000002s)]
*  truth. I don't think the Vietnam War was a smart idea and we lost 58000 Americans. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1658.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't see Trump doing that of pouring troops into Europe or or in, you know, there [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1664.14s)]
*  although might be something done at the Panama Canal, there might be something done at [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1670.26s)]
*  the DMZ and the Korean Peninsula. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1674.1s)]
*  But I don't see us going with that kind of war because we're in a cyber era and [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1675.98s)]
*  people do things and hack and manipulate information, this information in new ways [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1681.8999999999999s)]
*  short of Korean wars or Vietnam wars. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1687.82s)]
*  I mean, I spent my entire career in foreign policy. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1691.2199999999998s)]
*  I really as important as it is, I just don't think it even begins to compare with the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1693.9399999999998s)]
*  challenges that we face at home. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1701.14s)]
*  It's Lincoln laid out in his 1838 Young Men Please See Him Address. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1704.8600000000001s)]
*  He couldn't imagine a great power of the day taking a drink out of the Ohio or or [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1711.5s)]
*  or trotting the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1716.8200000000002s)]
*  It's it's. It's our own authorship with respect to whether or not we survive as a [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1721.3400000000001s)]
*  country. But I wanted to ask if you had to identify the single greatest challenge and [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1728.74s)]
*  threat, it is I preempt a lay on my view, which is the aggrandizement of presidential [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1735.86s)]
*  power, because everything flows, it seems to me, from the top down. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1744.46s)]
*  And the founders anticipated the possibility of an individual who had arise. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1749.6200000000001s)]
*  They tried to the best of their human capacity to create a political system, which was an [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1755.46s)]
*  open invitation to struggle, but shared and separated power served to some sort of [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1761.74s)]
*  constraint. But what they never what they never could guard against was the lack of [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1766.5s)]
*  internal constraints, what they referred to as moral self governance, that individuals had to [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1772.6200000000001s)]
*  police themselves to keep their desires, their ambitions under control. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1780.34s)]
*  They could never have foreseen what we're watching right now. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1786.4199999999998s)]
*  And I just wonder, is it is it that aggrandizement of presidential power? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1792.1s)]
*  Is that is that the key challenge that we face? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1797.22s)]
*  Nikki? It certainly seems to be to me, and I would put it in a broader context as well, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1800.54s)]
*  because the concentration of power in the presidency is happening with disregard, with [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1806.42s)]
*  utter disregard for the Congress, with probably going to see utter disregard for the courts [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1814.0600000000002s)]
*  for edging in that direction. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1819.5400000000002s)]
*  And what's what's more interesting in some ways is that what what the founders thought would [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1821.22s)]
*  happen if a president tried to steal away power from the legislators, that Congress would stand [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1827.14s)]
*  up and it would say, that's our power. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1832.3400000000001s)]
*  We're going to hold on to it. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1834.3s)]
*  And instead, what you have is a Congress who's like, you know what, you go ahead and do it. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1836.1s)]
*  We'll see how things work out with the president running the show. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1840.98s)]
*  And that lack of friction between the branches is allowing power to accumulate in the [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1843.94s)]
*  presidency and it's allowing for the sort of unchecked destruction in a way that is going to [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1850.18s)]
*  have enormous consequences, not just in what is lost in all of the federal agencies, in all of [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1856.4199999999998s)]
*  the research labs, in all of the places where state capacity is being dismantled. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1863.1s)]
*  But in that consolidation of power by a president who doesn't believe that there are places that [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1869.1399999999999s)]
*  should check him and a lot of those checks just kind of laying down and not pushing back. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1876.5s)]
*  And it's that lack of friction that really worries me because it allows sort of the train to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1882.1399999999999s)]
*  get so far out of the station, the horse to get so far out of the barn or the crisis to just grow so [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1887.3s)]
*  big so quickly that it becomes much more difficult to then try to contain and reverse it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1892.14s)]
*  So it's that presidential power, but also that lack of check on that power that concerns me most. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1898.14s)]
*  No, it's very well said. Doug, to you, I know you've written and spoken at length on [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1904.22s)]
*  executive orders. Could you just briefly because I want to move on to where I think, I mean, I'd [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1910.3000000000002s)]
*  like to hear your views on the future, which is the most fraught issue of all, right? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1917.82s)]
*  Your view as well is aggrandizement of presidential power is the greatest challenge we face or not? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1924.1799999999998s)]
*  That and climate change, personally. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1932.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1934.9399999999998s)]
*  I would go back to the founders. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1935.62s)]
*  I mean, remember, they did know Aaron Burr and they saw that what a bad actor somebody could do. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1939.62s)]
*  And while Hamilton got killed by Burr in the end, Burr has been thrown into the dung heap of history [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1945.9s)]
*  as a bad actor, bad operator. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1951.26s)]
*  But in our constitution, there's not these you can't have executive orders. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1953.78s)]
*  They're not there. But Washington's first term, he did one executive order, what we call the [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1959.54s)]
*  Neutrality Act. And you would see occasionally a president do one or two. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1965.74s)]
*  Lincoln came in strong, habeas corpus, civil war, and he went big with the Emancipation Proclamation [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1970.3799999999999s)]
*  as it worked its way through. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1977.4199999999998s)]
*  And some people call it's not accurate quite, but call it executive order number one. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1979.02s)]
*  If you have the power to do away with something like that, certainly that's the way Theodore Roosevelt [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1984.06s)]
*  looked at it. And TR was really the progenitor of the executive power. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1989.7s)]
*  He was so impatient. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1993.6599999999999s)]
*  He started saying, I'm not going to be stymied by Congress and the Senate. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1995.46s)]
*  I'll just go around them. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=1999.22s)]
*  And he did it over and over again. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2000.74s)]
*  And he did it for really good causes. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2002.38s)]
*  If you're a rational person, you look back and say pretty good executive order. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2004.7s)]
*  FDR came in and became Mr. Executive Order and did thousands. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2008.74s)]
*  Some great, I mean, Manhattan Project was an executive order. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2012.54s)]
*  Yet Japanese internment was an executive order. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2016.5800000000002s)]
*  And things like the Peace Corps can get created executive order, all sorts of things. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2020.8600000000001s)]
*  Trump's abusing executive power, in my opinion, in a ghastly way right now. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2024.22s)]
*  He started with day one flooding the systems with it. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2029.42s)]
*  He has utter disregard for what it is. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2032.26s)]
*  It started, Biden started doing it too much, trying to undo Trump. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2034.94s)]
*  And so now Trump's saying after his 34 felony convictions, after he feels the Justice [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2040.5800000000002s)]
*  Department, FBI was out for him, he's just burning down the House. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2047.9s)]
*  And he's going, he's intimidated Congress 100 percent. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2052.1s)]
*  There is no real Republican wing except for Alisa Murkowski or, you know, occasionally [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2057.02s)]
*  a voice, but it's not a 10, a gang of 10 telling Trump no. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2062.42s)]
*  So we are lost to that for the next two years. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2067.66s)]
*  We've got to hope our court system holds up and won't allow Trump or Trumpism to try [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2071.5s)]
*  to do illegal activities under the fig leaf that what Trump believes, which is what Nixon [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2078.62s)]
*  told David Frost, if the president does it, it must be legal. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2085.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2089.02s)]
*  Believes back to Nixon. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2089.8599999999997s)]
*  We are living in the revenge of Richard Nixon right now. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2091.66s)]
*  A year ago, I would never even have asked this question of the two of you. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2096.1s)]
*  And, Nikki, you were asked in an interview you do with the New York Times on the issue [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2100.8999999999996s)]
*  of a third term, and I think you said something like you would give it no more than 20 percent. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2105.3399999999997s)]
*  And then you said, but the fact that it's over zero in response to that question. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2112.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know your direct quote here, but I think it's an apt way of of transitioning [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2118.66s)]
*  to the future. So let me ask both of you very for for quick answers. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2125.8199999999997s)]
*  Some Jiu-Jitsu, some political Jiu-Jitsu in the next three years in order to enable a [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2132.4199999999996s)]
*  third term. Nikki. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2138.4599999999996s)]
*  You know, I still say that's a very slim chance, but I think it's a live issue. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2141.54s)]
*  I think it's a live issue that has to be guarded against and combated right now. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2146.02s)]
*  And what I said to the times was, what are we even talking about? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2151.1400000000003s)]
*  Like we're right here talking about whether or not democracy continues in the United [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2155.02s)]
*  States. And that's that's what we're talking about when we're talking about this [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2159.42s)]
*  possibility. Right. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2162.6600000000003s)]
*  Doug, do you think I think it's possible? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2163.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, FDR tried to avoid it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2166.8999999999996s)]
*  It was a norm to only do two terms and FDR did three. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2169.3799999999997s)]
*  Did four. Trump may try that. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2174.02s)]
*  He feels grandiose. Am I trying to find out? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2176.06s)]
*  I don't think it would hold up. I think the Supreme Court would shut him down in a [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2178.18s)]
*  heartbeat. That doesn't mean he can't pick who he wants. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2181.9799999999996s)]
*  And he runs his vice president and he's actually in power and not in a wink game. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2184.7799999999997s)]
*  He has a lot of tricks up his sleeves if he wants to kind of remain the power source [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2189.3399999999997s)]
*  of much of the world. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2194.94s)]
*  Right. Constitution wouldn't preclude or silent on the issue of a president becoming [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2196.7000000000003s)]
*  vice president. All right. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2201.94s)]
*  To the future. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2205.78s)]
*  Doug, you've said and I want to believe you, the end of this month I'll be I'll [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2208.94s)]
*  turn 76. I have kids and grandkids. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2214.18s)]
*  I've devoted most of my professional life to advancing the interests of this [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2217.62s)]
*  republic. I believe in it deeply. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2222.5s)]
*  You said that America, quote, is built to last. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2225.58s)]
*  It is an experiment, though. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2230.14s)]
*  What did you mean? What did you mean by that? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2232.06s)]
*  That you have to love the United States enough to believe it in. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2234.62s)]
*  You study like Nicole and I do and you do our past and our trials and tribulations [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2237.7s)]
*  and we're going to get through it. We don't have a choice. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2242.9s)]
*  So we've got to, you know, in the bill, Clinton told me when he was in the White [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2245.58s)]
*  House, he used to have like a piece of the moon just to realize the world is [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2249.66s)]
*  hundreds of millions of years old. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2254.5s)]
*  And we're dealing with here till the midterm election, a less than two year [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2257.1s)]
*  problem. And it just has to be all hands on deck. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2262.2599999999998s)]
*  A lot of people have to fight to save democracy or keep Trump in check. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2265.8999999999996s)]
*  Maybe he can maybe this time he can do something with Ukraine. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2271.22s)]
*  I'm doubtful. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2275.22s)]
*  Just like George W. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2276.8599999999997s)]
*  Bush said, he saw the soul in Putin's eyes. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2278.06s)]
*  I think Trump's being played by Putin. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2281.2999999999997s)]
*  But look, it's there's a lot of bloodshed. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2283.06s)]
*  Maybe Trump can have a good role there. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2285.2599999999998s)]
*  Maybe the Israel is in Gaza whenever that ends. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2286.7799999999997s)]
*  What's the post-world there like? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2292.8599999999997s)]
*  We'll have to see. But Trump, Trump might be able to get something out of China. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2295.22s)]
*  The tariffs of 25 percent to Canada just I don't understand. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2298.9399999999996s)]
*  To me, that's not house thinking to pick on allies like he is. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2303.58s)]
*  But they're resilient. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2307.82s)]
*  Countries are resilient. I think we're strong enough. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2309.34s)]
*  I think our vitals are strong enough in our country, our banking, our corporations [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2311.78s)]
*  or universities to take this this blow back. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2316.34s)]
*  And it's a pendulum swing. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2319.82s)]
*  Arthur Schlesinger, not to keep doing Hofstetter and Schlesinger, but it's just [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2321.58s)]
*  the pendulum went into crazy town here. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2325.82s)]
*  And we got to get back down. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2328.86s)]
*  Ronald Reagan wasn't crazy. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2330.34s)]
*  Ronald Reagan was, you know, the diplomacy, you know, the world's favorite, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2332.02s)]
*  even though he was a conservative, wanted less government. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2335.58s)]
*  But with Trump, we're dealing with a bizarre creature, but he's ours. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2338.46s)]
*  We created Trump by making news and journalism, entertainment. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2342.98s)]
*  And there are many reasons why Trump is in our we own him. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2348.02s)]
*  A lot of what we've done in the last 30 years, the way we've [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2354.06s)]
*  deprioritized public schools and the like. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2357.22s)]
*  And hopefully we'll get public schools, better health care, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2360.54s)]
*  keep Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare going and try to help people. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2364.54s)]
*  Most Americans are good. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2368.74s)]
*  I travel everywhere and there's a big soul, loving heart. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2370.02s)]
*  Get out there, talk to people, love the country. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2373.62s)]
*  Don't polarize and get ready to to take him on in a midterm. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2375.8999999999996s)]
*  Nikki, I'm reminded of that apocryphal conversation. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2382.38s)]
*  The two of you could tell me whether it's apocryphal or not of Elizabeth [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2386.38s)]
*  Willing Powell, the wife of the mayor of Philadelphia, costing or [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2390.38s)]
*  encountering Ben Franklin as he was emerging from the Constitutional Convention. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2395.2200000000003s)]
*  And she asks him, well, Mr. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2399.58s)]
*  Franklin, what did you produce? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2402.06s)]
*  A monarchy or a republic? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2403.9s)]
*  And he responds a republic, if you could keep it. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2406.06s)]
*  What do you think about an America built to last? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2408.94s)]
*  I think that it's not inevitable. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2413.78s)]
*  Often when I'm contemplating kind of the potential turning point that we are at [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2415.98s)]
*  in the United States, I think about, you know, freed Black people in the South [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2420.82s)]
*  in the 1880s and 1890s who had for a moment tasted freedom and biracial governance [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2426.54s)]
*  and the ability to vote for men in the South and then slid into a kind of [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2434.22s)]
*  undemocratic, frankly, fascistic government in the South where they had very few rights, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2440.4599999999996s)]
*  very few opportunities for economic advancement, where they were second [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2446.7s)]
*  class citizens at best, their citizenship wasn't fully realized. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2450.18s)]
*  And it was like that for 80 years. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2453.7799999999997s)]
*  And over the course of those 80 years, people kept a dream of what a [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2456.54s)]
*  America could be alive and they continued to believe in it and continue to work for [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2461.2999999999997s)]
*  it and continue to force the issue. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2466.18s)]
*  I think that the road back from where we are now is a multi-generational project. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2468.74s)]
*  And one of the things we know from U.S. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2474.74s)]
*  history is that even after times of enormous crises, like the Civil War, like [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2476.94s)]
*  the Great Depression, the windows for reform do not stay open long. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2481.98s)]
*  And that's why I think it's absolutely vital that we continue to work for it. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2486.42s)]
*  I think it's absolutely vital for people who believe in that promise of a republic, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2490.06s)]
*  of American democracy, who understand that it is under threat right now, that the [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2496.22s)]
*  constitutional order has been broken apart, that the international order is being [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2501.58s)]
*  broken apart, to figure out now what your values are, what world you want to build [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2505.5s)]
*  in the aftermath and keep that dream alive and figure out how you're going to help [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2512.06s)]
*  build that in the moment that a window of reform opens. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2516.9s)]
*  Because we are at a pivot point in the United States, the exact one that Benjamin [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2520.7400000000002s)]
*  Franklin was talking about, right? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2526.5s)]
*  Are you going to be a monarchy or republic now? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2528.1s)]
*  We would say, are you going to be autocratic or democratic? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2530.3s)]
*  And we could be either one of those things. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2533.7000000000003s)]
*  And we are going to have to fight for which one we want to be. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2537.1800000000003s)]
*  It's keeping that alive. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2541.98s)]
*  I think it's really important. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2543.3s)]
*  Very well said. You're both on university campuses and the notion of a [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2544.38s)]
*  multi-generational road back, I think is absolutely right. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2548.7000000000003s)]
*  I measure my life, my working life in terms of administration time, four to eight [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2551.5800000000004s)]
*  year increments. But obviously, the frame here is much broader. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2556.42s)]
*  And I just want to ask you to respond to something that I feel very strongly about. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2560.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, the country is not a giant ATM machine where people only get to make [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2564.78s)]
*  withdrawals. They have to make deposits, too. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2570.66s)]
*  And the deposits, from my point of view, are the obligations and responsibilities [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2574.7799999999997s)]
*  of citizenship, civic education, an attachment to ideals, a country, its [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2579.06s)]
*  norms and institutions that are broader than just you. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2585.7799999999997s)]
*  And I just wonder how far we're slipping from the kind of national experiences [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2589.1s)]
*  and civic education that would help engender that kind of identification. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2598.58s)]
*  I worry that we can no longer grieve and or celebrate together as a nation. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2605.14s)]
*  I worry greatly about that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2612.46s)]
*  So just a minute from each of you. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2614.06s)]
*  Are the are the trend lines better than the headlines on this one? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2617.7000000000003s)]
*  I hope so. Doug, to you. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2621.42s)]
*  I think if you get break things down to a local level, you feel a little better [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2623.62s)]
*  when you're living in a neighborhood and you know people. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2627.9399999999996s)]
*  I think our country is stronger. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2630.54s)]
*  However, we have lost our way in the education field. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2632.3399999999997s)]
*  We have to promote civics and what it means to do public service. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2637.02s)]
*  We have to teach geography. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2641.18s)]
*  We have to do more than than go. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2643.2599999999998s)]
*  Here's a big public school. Who are the smart kids and are not great civil rights [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2645.7799999999997s)]
*  leaders? Robert Moses, son of Mississippi, used to teach. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2650.22s)]
*  I went and visit him and he'd go into a poor neighborhood and they used to. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2652.9s)]
*  He would. They would. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2656.66s)]
*  If you didn't make it into algebra, we left you behind. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2657.7s)]
*  And so we've got to watch that we're not by gutting education and not caring. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2661.42s)]
*  We're just looking to cherry pick. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2665.7799999999997s)]
*  People that have a great intellect or have a capacity for university [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2667.8599999999997s)]
*  academic study and leaving the rest or looking down on the rest of the country. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2673.7799999999997s)]
*  The one sin in America's condescension. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2678.1400000000003s)]
*  I grew up in Perrysburg, Ohio, a rural town. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2680.7000000000003s)]
*  You can get away with anything. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2683.58s)]
*  My friends, the high school friends, voted Obama twice and now they voted Trump. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2685.1s)]
*  And for some reason, they feel Hillary Clinton condescended. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2689.9s)]
*  They didn't go to the local pizza place and that their media is spinning them on stuff. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2693.58s)]
*  And Trump's convinced them of that. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2699.6600000000003s)]
*  They're winnable back. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2701.42s)]
*  But, you know, the onslaught of social media when Barack Obama won, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2703.42s)]
*  there was no social media like today. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2708.26s)]
*  Now it's a wild west. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2710.2200000000003s)]
*  And everybody I see complaining about social media, they're all on X. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2712.54s)]
*  Well, I'm not on X. OK, I don't want anything to do with a business of Elon Musk. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2716.1s)]
*  So get off of it. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2720.5s)]
*  But every journalist I know is still on X because it's about my career. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2721.9s)]
*  And I've got to be on X. We'll spur you. Get off X. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2725.26s)]
*  Go join Blue Sky or something, you know, because otherwise you're just feeding [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2728.38s)]
*  into that beast and then we'll get preachy and say, are you not understanding [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2733.38s)]
*  democracy's on the line? But my favorite thing is to be on X. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2738.1800000000003s)]
*  It's a disconnect. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2741.98s)]
*  So if you're going to go and win the American people, do it from the heart, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2743.1400000000003s)]
*  not out of a sense of personal superiority. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2747.2200000000003s)]
*  And I would just co-assign that. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2751.34s)]
*  I mean, I think that the poisoned information environment is one of our biggest [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2752.86s)]
*  obstacles in trying to build something coming out of this. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2756.02s)]
*  But I also believe that change really can happen at the local level. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIAtjGVUdxc&t=2759.94s)]
