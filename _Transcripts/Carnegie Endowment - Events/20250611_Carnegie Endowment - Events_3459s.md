Video Description: With a fragmenting media ecosystem and a lack of trusted messengers, conveying information to both decision makers and the public has become an increasingly complicated endeavor. In the face of new mediums of communication and escalating global tensions, every communicator—from scholars and journalists to politicians and diplomats—must adapt their messaging and means for outreach. What are the emerging opportunities and challenges for foreign policy scholars and journalists as they seek to reach the public or decision makers? What will effective communication practices look like in the future of foreign policy? 
For young professionals in foreign policy, these questions will shape both our careers and the ways that stakeholders outside of the foreign policy community understand our work. What distinct approaches can younger communicators bring to elevate discussions about policy? How can we craft our own voices and stand out in a rapidly changing media and information environment? 
Join Jane Darby Menton, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment, as she discusses effective foreign policy communication from a range of different perspectives, featuring Joshua Keating, a senior correspondent at Vox covering foreign policy, David Lawler, deputy managing editor at Axios, and Fergus Shiel, the managing editor at the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

# Foreign Policy for Modern Audiences
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk)
*  Hi everyone, welcome back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=30.0s)]
*  We hope you enjoyed the lunch. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Or if you're just joining us now, welcome. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=41.84s)]
*  I'm Margot Treadwell. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  So first, I'm excited to kick off the rest of our event. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=45.66s)]
*  We have an exciting panel after this on youth in Africa and we'll conclude our day with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=50.18s)]
*  a keynote speaker, Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  But first, I am very excited to announce our second panel, Foreign Policy for Modern Audiences, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=57.88s)]
*  moderated by Jane Darby-Menton, a fellow in the nuclear policy program at Carnegie and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=65.16s)]
*  director of the Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=70.2s)]
*  She'll be moderating a discussion with Dave Lawler, Fergus Scheele, and Josh Keating. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=74.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=82.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, thanks so much and thank you all for being here today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=92.0s)]
*  I'm really excited to be moderating this conversation about sort of the challenges and opportunities [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=104.44s)]
*  that come with trying to communicate ideas and talk about foreign policy in the modern [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=109.76s)]
*  world, which is a world that feels saturated, if not over saturated, with at least noise, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  if not news. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=120.76s)]
*  And also, I think for a lot of us, we see this as integral to our work. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=122.58000000000001s)]
*  We recognize that it's really important to do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=126.68s)]
*  But the pathways for doing it effectively are increasingly difficult to find and sometimes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=129.0s)]
*  it feels like that ball is moving really quickly. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  And so this is, I think, a really great opportunity to talk to the three of you about your experiences [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=137.48s)]
*  navigating that ecosystem and to sort of flip the tables a little bit and to get to ask [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=142.56s)]
*  questions to people who tend to be the ones asking questions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm also delighted because personally, I started my career as a journalist and I like to kind [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  of think of myself as a journalist in remission. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=156.16s)]
*  And so I think this is a really cool conversation we're going to get to have right now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  So just the way it's going to work, so we're going to have a moderated conversation up [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  here for a bit and then we'll turn over to the audience for Q&A. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=166.16s)]
*  That'll be about 20 minutes and there should be mics in the room. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=170.88s)]
*  All right. So just to briefly give a little bit of a longer introduction to the three of you and then turn [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=174.76s)]
*  it over to some questions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=178.88s)]
*  Dave Lawler is the deputy managing editor at Axios, where he oversees coverage of national [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=181.12s)]
*  security and U.S. foreign policy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=185.8s)]
*  You've probably seen his name in your inbox and newsletters. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=187.76s)]
*  Josh Keating is a senior correspondent at Vox, covering foreign policy and world news with a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=191.84s)]
*  focus on the future of international conflict. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=196.56s)]
*  And Fergus Scheele is managing editor at the International Consortium of Investigative [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=198.84s)]
*  Journalists, where he's overseen multiple prize winning investigations, including things [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=202.68s)]
*  like the Pandora Papers and the Benson files. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  So this is a really exciting panel, not only because you all are working on really important [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=210.32s)]
*  things, but I think you're also coming at it from slightly different angles. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=214.4s)]
*  And so I think we're going to get into some of that next. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=216.92s)]
*  So to kick things off, I wanted to ask a question to the three of you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that, you know, the way we frame questions about communication right now are often [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=223.6s)]
*  we start with the challenges. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=228.8s)]
*  And I think we're going to get into a lot of that as well. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=230.12s)]
*  But I want to maybe try to at least kick us off on a slightly more optimistic note. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  So this is the Junior Fellows Conference. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=236.96s)]
*  We have fantastic junior fellows at Carnegie who are doing really good work and they really [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=239.16s)]
*  want to. I think they're optimistic and excited about trying to figure out how to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=243.24s)]
*  communicate that more broadly. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=247.44s)]
*  So what would you see as some of the opportunities for communicating, especially for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=249.24s)]
*  younger people in this space? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=254.44s)]
*  And what do you think people should be doing if that's something that you want to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=256.56s)]
*  incorporate into their work? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=259.4s)]
*  Sure. I'll make a couple of points. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=262.52s)]
*  You guys might have more full, fulsome answers than me. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=264.4s)]
*  I think one of the advantages to being young in any field is that you're not as beholden [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=268.64s)]
*  to the sort of traditions and structures of the way you do the job as the people who [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=273.64000000000004s)]
*  are who have been doing it for a longer time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=279.24s)]
*  I mean, I joined I became a full time journalist in kind of the period where Twitter [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  was emerging as a major force in international news. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=287.68s)]
*  And those of us, you know, I'm not a big poster, so I didn't build a massive brand for [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=293.12s)]
*  myself as some did on Twitter. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  But I certainly could use Twitter as a news gathering tool in a way that that was very [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=299.68s)]
*  helpful at that time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=305.84s)]
*  I won't even pretend to know where the conversation is happening now, even let alone [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=306.96s)]
*  in five or 10 years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=313.0s)]
*  But I think the adaptability that comes with being open to new forms of gathering [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=314.08s)]
*  information and presenting it rather than, you know, I started on a broadsheet newspaper [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=320.2s)]
*  where, you know, getting your name in print was the biggest goal out there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=326.64s)]
*  And then we sort of ignored the fact that very, very few people were ever seeing it in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=331.08s)]
*  print over time. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=334.08s)]
*  And so I think there's certainly opportunities there to to not just say, oh, this person [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=335.68s)]
*  who's 10 years more senior than me does their job this way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=341.52s)]
*  Therefore, I will do my job this way. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=344.0s)]
*  You can certainly learn from from older colleagues, but not being afraid to to, you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=346.32s)]
*  know, use your competitive advantage in the sense of, you know, just being more fluent [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=352.92s)]
*  with with new forms of communication. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=358.84s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. Thanks, Jane Darby. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=362.12s)]
*  And thanks to Carnegie for hosting us. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=363.68s)]
*  This is it's funny. This is kind of like a little homecoming for me because I my career [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  started in this building when I worked at Foreign Policy magazine, which at the time [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=371.28s)]
*  for about 20 years or so, I think was published by the Carnegie Endowment. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=377.96s)]
*  And so I started here and then was acquired by the Post shortly after it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=382.6s)]
*  But, you know, I I sort of liked being at the nexus of those two worlds working for a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=386.96s)]
*  media organization that sort of had one foot in a think tank and one was also very [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=395.88s)]
*  consciously trying to build a larger audience and, you know, not trying to just [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=401.84s)]
*  communicate to the people who work in this building or, you know, the two buildings [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=406.76s)]
*  down the street, but to the general public. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=411.88s)]
*  And I totally agree with what Dave said. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, when I remember starting out like blogs, you know, just the ability to like [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=418.68s)]
*  write, having an informal voice and writing in first person and that kind of style was [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=423.8s)]
*  was like very hot at that time. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=429.76s)]
*  And, you know, it was definitely like an area of opportunity if you were sort of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  younger and hadn't been around quite as long. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  And so so that's an advantage. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=443.6s)]
*  And also, you know, I just think a big part of what our role is is sort of letting [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=446.12s)]
*  different audiences in on the conversation that other groups are having. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=452.0s)]
*  I think like right now, the information ecosystem is so siloed and often it's people [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=456.64s)]
*  just having conversations with each other. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=462.44s)]
*  So I think, you know, for me, it's like what what is the sort of policy making [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=464.52s)]
*  community in D.C. talking about that the wider public isn't aware of that would be [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=470.24s)]
*  interested in. So that's where I see my role. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, there's there's all kinds of conversations happening that in. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=477.68s)]
*  You know, just consume small groups of people that people outside those groups [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=482.56s)]
*  would be interested in. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=487.72s)]
*  So it's I think there are just so many opportunities to let people in on those [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=488.64s)]
*  conversations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=494.56s)]
*  I work for a tiny organization. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=497.12s)]
*  It's only about a couple of blocks from here. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=498.72s)]
*  And we have done, I think, five of the biggest projects in history. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=501.16s)]
*  And the reason we've been able to do it is something that you can all do. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=505.76s)]
*  So you, because you're young, are tech savvy. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  You have to be tech savvy to do this. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=513.2s)]
*  The other thing is you have to be collaborative. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=514.92s)]
*  So you all have lots of friends and you will go on to have lots of friends. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  As you get older, you'll have fewer friends. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  So you can collaborate. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  You can use technology and you're also the most international generation in history. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=524.36s)]
*  And what to tackle systemic problems now, you need the radical embrace of technology. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=529.36s)]
*  You need to be collaborative and you need to be international. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=535.64s)]
*  And you need to be international because so many of our problems now are systemic, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=538.96s)]
*  global, and the problems that occur in this city may have their genesis in another city [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=544.0400000000001s)]
*  or another country. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=549.64s)]
*  And so I think you are at the cusp, you're poised to be able to do wonderful things. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=550.84s)]
*  So there's massive grounds for optimism. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I actually I want to kind of pick up on that and ask you a little bit more about [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=560.76s)]
*  some of these huge undertakings that you've done. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=564.88s)]
*  So I think that, you know, if you are a researcher or even just a person right now, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=567.6s)]
*  you know, one of the biggest sort of things to do to think about is like, how do you take [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=571.72s)]
*  reams of information and like parse it in a reasonable way? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=575.84s)]
*  And I think that the types of investigations you've worked on are really interesting case [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=579.84s)]
*  study for this. So I think what was that the Pandora papers was like 12 million documents [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=583.88s)]
*  or something. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=588.76s)]
*  Yes, the Pandora papers, 11.9 million documents, and it was from 14 offshore companies. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  And we worked on it for two years. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  And how do you do that? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=596.68s)]
*  Well, you can't do it alone because that's more documents than will fit in the university [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=597.64s)]
*  library. So what you do when you next go to do it is you get you use you deploy technology. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=601.6s)]
*  So we have technology that allows us to store index and translate documents. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  That's a really helpful piece of technology. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=613.36s)]
*  We have a second piece of technology at ICIJ, which is a virtual newsroom, which is a bit [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=615.76s)]
*  like Facebook, where reporters can work around the clock and can fish in that lagoon of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=620.64s)]
*  documents for 24 7. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=625.56s)]
*  And through that collaboration, going back to collaboration, collaboration is so essential [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=630.28s)]
*  because it overcomes the tyranny of distance. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=634.7199999999999s)]
*  It overcomes the tyranny of language. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=637.1199999999999s)]
*  It overcomes the tyranny of misunderstanding. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=638.92s)]
*  So with collaboration, with technology, with hard work, amazing things can be achieved. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=642.04s)]
*  And as a consequence of the Pandora papers, we uncovered the offshore wealth, the hidden [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  financial secrets of more than 100 billionaires, more than 300 politicians. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=654.12s)]
*  We embraced reporters, 600 reporters from 170 countries. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  And we were able to do all of that from a tiny office, which at that stage didn't have a [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=665.52s)]
*  sink here in D.C. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=672.56s)]
*  And at the as a consequence of that, many reforms flowed and we were able to rock the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  world. That sounds very, very efficient. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=683.64s)]
*  OK, so a question for for Josh and Dave. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=689.32s)]
*  So a kind of you know, it seems like there's you know, we talk about journalism in general, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=691.5600000000001s)]
*  but there's a different ways of there's different versions of this. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=694.96s)]
*  So these like long investigative projects. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  But the two of you are sort of in a slightly different position right now where you're [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=700.08s)]
*  having to respond to a lot of things that are breaking really quickly. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=702.88s)]
*  And so I wanted to ask you a little bit about how you are thinking about sort of making [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=706.08s)]
*  quick choices when so many things are going on. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=711.96s)]
*  How do you make decisions about priorities, what you're going to write about, what [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=714.8s)]
*  you're going to assign? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=718.0s)]
*  What does that process look like for you? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=719.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like the eternal dilemma and you never quite get the balance [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=722.16s)]
*  right. Every job I've had, it's always been like, how much do I respond to breaking news [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=725.64s)]
*  and how you know, because that does come at the expense of longer term reporting [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=730.36s)]
*  projects. I think the way an editor I work with put it, she said you should always have [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=734.72s)]
*  like a three day story and a three week story and a three month story like going at any [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=740.6s)]
*  given time. In some places you have a three hour story or a three minute story. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=746.28s)]
*  Like thankfully, thankfully I'm not in a job where I'm doing that quite right now. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=750.1600000000001s)]
*  But you know, there's different roles. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=755.24s)]
*  I mean, like breaking news coverage is really important, but I've tended toward work [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=761.04s)]
*  that's more kind of analysis driven. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=769.24s)]
*  And so I like kind of the second third day stories where you take a step back and consider [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=770.92s)]
*  the larger consequences of an event that happened, an under covered angle of it that [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=778.76s)]
*  other people aren't talking about. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=783.92s)]
*  You know, it's it's. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=787.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, if you're not going to be the first one to report it, you should have like [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=790.8s)]
*  something more interesting to say about it than than other people have. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  And so I think like the longer you get time wise from what you're writing about, the more [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=797.92s)]
*  the premium on originality and approach goes up. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=803.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think we've we've answered this in the right order because Fergus was talking about [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=809.12s)]
*  two years investigations. Josh, I think, is a master of the this happened this week. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=812.56s)]
*  Here's how you should think about it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=816.64s)]
*  Kind of story that contextualizes the day one news. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=817.8399999999999s)]
*  And I am just coming off two years of running Axios web coverage, including breaking news [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=822.2399999999999s)]
*  during the twenty twenty four election, et cetera. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=828.56s)]
*  And so like extremely quick fuse thing happens. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=830.88s)]
*  Get a story out the door, ideally with a bit of reporting and context, but sometimes get [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=834.8s)]
*  the story up and then add that after the fact. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=839.92s)]
*  I mean, it's like we it's it's it's just different demands, depending on what part of the media [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=841.84s)]
*  ecosystem you're in now. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=848.32s)]
*  But there is the question. And I think this happens in all. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=850.0s)]
*  If you're communicating information, there's this dilemma of you first have the nugget of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=852.64s)]
*  something. Do you put that initial piece of information out or, you know, do you build, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=857.2s)]
*  you know, for us, additional sources, more context, more information until you have a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=863.52s)]
*  more comprehensive story? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=868.16s)]
*  Axios tends to be we have kind of a scoop lit culture where we will, you know, I edit a guy [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  named Barack Ravid, who some of you may have seen his work, and he tends to drive other [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=876.64s)]
*  journalists in town nuts because, you know, they've been working on something for a while [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  and he will just grab the key nugget of information that he's heard from sources, get it out into the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=887.28s)]
*  world. And all of a sudden they throw their hands up because they've been reporting this story. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=891.76s)]
*  And so the pace of it can differ. But we also do sometimes, you know, we had a story this [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=896.0s)]
*  morning that wasn't particularly earth shattering, but about processes within the DNI's [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=900.64s)]
*  office on things that we, you know, sort of took a few extra days to make sure that because I'm [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=906.32s)]
*  not familiar with processes in the ODNI in particular. So like, OK, it will be embarrassing [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=914.16s)]
*  if we have a bit of a scoop. But, you know, if we put it out and one aspect of information is wrong, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=920.24s)]
*  the intended audience will not pay attention to everything else we've put in this document. So [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=926.08s)]
*  buttoning that up as much as possible. But yes, certainly depending where you are in the media, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=930.88s)]
*  the demands on immediately responding to news versus sitting with it for a while will depend [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=936.4s)]
*  quite a bit. It will differ quite a bit, rather. Yeah, that kind of sets me up nicely for the next. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=943.6s)]
*  I think that there's, you know, the question of time horizons and what that means. Another, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=948.24s)]
*  I think, increasingly interesting question now is the medium question itself. So like [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=952.8s)]
*  the extent to which the medium is the message and how that then affects it. And all three of you, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=958.0s)]
*  I think, have touched on that in slightly different ways. So, you know, the way you communicate via a [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=962.24s)]
*  newsletter, which, you know, Axios is so good at, you've also worked on podcasts, you've also written [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=966.64s)]
*  books, and then, you know, ICIJ, you put out a lot of different types of products of different levels. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=970.88s)]
*  I'd love to ask y'all a little bit about how you, how to tell the most effective stories [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=976.4s)]
*  in the medium you're using. How do you think about where those matches lie? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  I think it's changing really quickly. For example, like I'm a big podcast listener, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=988.72s)]
*  and every once in a while, I'll listen to a podcast episode and then realize at the end, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=993.36s)]
*  oh, five years ago, that would have been a magazine piece, probably. Like, you know, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=997.68s)]
*  they have the architecture of a lot of different angles of reporting, they're profiling someone, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1001.92s)]
*  whatever the case may be, and that would just not have been something. I mean, podcasts, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1007.68s)]
*  reported podcasts have been around for a little while, but like, you know, people are taking the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1011.8399999999999s)]
*  tools that we all need to have in terms of building a story, knowing when you've got it down solidly, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1017.5999999999999s)]
*  but distributing it in ways that we wouldn't even have thought of five or ten years ago. For us, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1022.9599999999999s)]
*  we're known for newsletters in particular. When I joined Axios in 2017, I kind of thought, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1029.52s)]
*  okay, we'll ride this email newsletter wave for a couple years, but I think it's probably, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1035.04s)]
*  we're, I think we've reached peak newsletter, and turns out we haven't. It's still been a [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1039.04s)]
*  phenomenon that is quite effective because you're hitting people where they are. Everybody scrolls [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1044.56s)]
*  their inbox every day, and you're going to see something directly from us rather than you having [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  to think, oh, I wonder what Axios is reporting today. We're going to tell you in your inbox. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1053.04s)]
*  So that's an effective, surprisingly effective tool in a, as you mentioned, a media ecosystem that is, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1058.16s)]
*  it's just, there's so many different ways that you can absorb information, and there's very few [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1066.48s)]
*  places that are reaching audiences at scale in the ways that the nightly news did a generation ago, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1072.64s)]
*  or even the biggest newspapers in the country did, you know, when I was getting into [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1080.8799999999999s)]
*  into journalism. So I think people are getting more creative with trying to find audiences [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1088.16s)]
*  where they are, whether it's in podcasts or in their inbox, because you just can't depend on [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1093.04s)]
*  the fact that people will come find your stuff. It's pretty difficult. Yeah, I mean, the thing [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1097.92s)]
*  comes to mind for me when it comes to time horizons is I did have an opportunity a few years ago to [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1106.16s)]
*  write a book, and it was really a sort of mental struggle in a way, too, because, you know, it's a [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1110.24s)]
*  book that dealt with sort of ongoing recent events, and so I turned it in, and when I turned in a [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1119.52s)]
*  magazine piece that, you know, the places I've worked, my expectations were at most it'll be up [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1126.56s)]
*  in a few days, like usually it'll be up the next day or in a few hours, and the idea that I was [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1131.92s)]
*  just going to have to sit there for months as events in the world continued happening while I [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1137.68s)]
*  couldn't address them. You know, I think I was driving my editor crazy after a while, calling [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1144.5600000000002s)]
*  her, asking if I could make updates to it, like if it were up to me, I would have been like changing [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1150.24s)]
*  things up until the night before, and so it's, you know, both have their place, but it, I'd say you [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1154.3200000000002s)]
*  have to like sort of adjust your thinking and the way you kind of operate in time in order to sort [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1162.48s)]
*  of change formats like that. I see Ajay's approach is different. We think about it differently, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1169.84s)]
*  so what we do essentially is solve giant puzzles all at the same time, so we do multiple puzzles [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1177.52s)]
*  in multiple countries over years, and so to amplify our solutions or to improve our [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1184.56s)]
*  solutions, we work with reporters around the world, but then to share our findings, we do [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1191.52s)]
*  something different. So I'll give you a small example, this is a tiny example, so take, we [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1197.76s)]
*  famously did a story about Nike and we went to shops all around Europe and we bought Nike sneakers [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1204.24s)]
*  and we wondered where they were taxed, and then we discovered that the sneakers in London and Paris [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1209.84s)]
*  and all went into the Netherlands, and that's, that was tax point number one, but in fact they [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1214.6399999999999s)]
*  weren't paying much tax in the Netherlands, it was going after a tiny office in Hamilton and [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1220.48s)]
*  in Bermuda, and they were all paying their tax through this, which meant that Nike was paying [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1224.48s)]
*  very little tax because of the swoosh on the Nike runners. The swoosh on the runners was a royalty [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1228.4s)]
*  payment which reduced the tax in Europe, okay, so what you have there already is multiple countries [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1234.0s)]
*  doing the same stories about the same runners, and here is the thing, so as a tiny bird on the back [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1240.08s)]
*  of a water buffalo, because that is what ICIJ is, we are working with the global media and they can [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1245.36s)]
*  all do that story at the same time, they can all do the same story at the same time because they'll, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1250.8799999999999s)]
*  we all love Nike runners, we all have Nike runners, our kids from Nike runners, our parents [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1255.12s)]
*  from Nike runners, and we can put the story out at the same time. So we have a website, we have a [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1258.8s)]
*  really wonderful web team, we also have a social media team who are great and they work tirelessly, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1263.84s)]
*  but our solution to amplifying our message is to publish at the same time all around the world with [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1268.7199999999998s)]
*  multiple partners and the reason that we can do that, the reason why that's important is because [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1274.4s)]
*  Nike is a very big company, if Nike is annoyed it has a lot of lawyers and Nike is one of the good [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1279.8400000000001s)]
*  guys. If you're dealing with kleptocrats and narco traffickers and Ponzi schemers, they are not nice [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1286.5600000000002s)]
*  people and by publishing at the same time in multiple countries you provide protection [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1292.72s)]
*  against legal suits, you provide protection against threats, you provide protection against assault, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1301.76s)]
*  in legislative assault, and that is why we publish in the way we do. The work that Axios and Vox does [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1309.44s)]
*  is amazing, like unbelievable, the speed, the alacrity that they do their work is incredible, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1317.36s)]
*  I'm in awe of it, but our type of news is slow news with big impact. Yeah, I think this is really [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1322.48s)]
*  interesting because I think it also touches on in sort of the think tank world and especially at a [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1330.32s)]
*  global think tank like Carnegie, we touch on bits of this in different ways and one of them is that [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  the stakes for going after powerful people can be different in different places and so I kind of two [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1339.4399999999998s)]
*  questions out of that, one is how do you navigate the fact that like, again maybe that's changing, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1347.12s)]
*  but like you run real risks sometimes when you go after these big stories, how do you navigate that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1352.6399999999999s)]
*  and how sort of as you're managing a team of people who might be in more hostile contexts are [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1358.56s)]
*  you thinking about some of those balances? And then kind of a question for all three of you, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1363.12s)]
*  you know we've been talking a lot about what it's like to communicate as a journalist, but [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1367.52s)]
*  people in this room also might be trying to communicate with you as a means of communicating [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1371.84s)]
*  and so I'm curious if you could maybe say you know what version of that interaction do you think is [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  mutually beneficial or like when you're doing some of this work where can people who are maybe more [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1380.96s)]
*  on the research side but are still tackling global questions or questions that are in the moment, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1385.68s)]
*  how do we engage more effectively with the type of work you all are doing? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1390.16s)]
*  I'll start with the first question, but I think that you know Fergus I think would probably have a [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1400.0800000000002s)]
*  you know a higher stakes perspective on this than me because for you know we day to day navigate [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1407.68s)]
*  the fact that the you know White House press office is not happy with stuff that we are going [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1412.88s)]
*  to be reporting but it's you know for I mean the stakes have have raised significantly obviously [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1418.0s)]
*  some outlets don't have the same access that they had previously you know but for us for the most [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1424.4s)]
*  part it's you know you get an angry email actually one of the big questions is what do you do if they [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1429.3600000000001s)]
*  say your story's wrong but you still think it's right right do you run the story with the denial [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1435.2s)]
*  the White House says this isn't true which we've done you know multiple times but in some ways it's [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1439.12s)]
*  a it's the that that dynamic has changed I will say the Biden operation wasn't the most it wasn't [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1446.7199999999998s)]
*  the easiest to work with for for journalists in some ways too I think to some regard they [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1454.9599999999998s)]
*  they they were more affronted by critical journalism than the Trump people who are very [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1461.76s)]
*  accustomed to it at this point and so we got really strong pushback on stories in from the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1466.64s)]
*  from the Biden folks that we didn't think were you know at the level of you know they sort of [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  or were as you know even controversial as they as they probably thought that they [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1482.16s)]
*  they were but you know that's not battling it out in the courts which I think is a different [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1490.0800000000002s)]
*  battle which fortunately you know I I haven't been directly involved in [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1496.8000000000002s)]
*  litigation over my reporting thankfully so I'm sure ICIJ has had to worry about that with just [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  about every big story that that you guys publish but yeah I mean people have megaphones people who [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1507.68s)]
*  have big megaphones and don't want scrutiny certainly have just as big you know every [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1513.76s)]
*  sometimes the punch back is louder than our initial punch which can actually help get the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1520.64s)]
*  story out in some in some ways but you know how do you contend with that I guess it's [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1526.5600000000002s)]
*  for the most part you just have to to be willing to to continue to to put the stories out there [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1533.5200000000002s)]
*  even if you know it's going to ruffle a couple of feathers but yeah you guys may have more [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1541.2800000000002s)]
*  experience with that than I do [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1548.16s)]
*  so we're all in the same business you know we are so we're in the business of truth [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1553.04s)]
*  that you know at its core that's what we're in okay and it's and at the moment there's a do or [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1557.68s)]
*  die battle in the world over truth truth really matters like it matters it's essential it is [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1561.92s)]
*  it is why we why journalists do what they do okay and if you can't defend truth your democracy [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1568.24s)]
*  collapses so this is what where we're at right now and so what Dave and Josh do is so important [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1574.72s)]
*  because the instant truth it's instant truth and it and it immediately counters the counter [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1581.2s)]
*  narrative okay what we do is is long-term truth so the consequences of long-term truth can be much [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1586.24s)]
*  graver than those for instant truth that that is the reality and so for our partners in Russia at [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1594.32s)]
*  the end of Pandora papers they all had to leave so 16 out of 17 reporters left because it was [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1600.48s)]
*  unsafe the 17th stayed because his baby didn't have a passport so we couldn't leave so we were [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1605.68s)]
*  worried about that our partner you know I've had a partner in Benin that's gone to jail one of our [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1612.16s)]
*  guys went to equatorial guinea the other day and ended up in police custody for a while so Venezuela [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1617.52s)]
*  there's hardly any reporters left they're all out of Venezuela Costa Rica has all the Nicaraguans [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1623.2s)]
*  so all around the world including in my own country in Ireland there are really grim [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1629.68s)]
*  situations for reporters you know there's death threats there's pegasus which is a way of tracking [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1634.0s)]
*  reporters and so the advantage that we have at ICIJ is by publishing together it goes back to [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1638.3200000000002s)]
*  the earlier thing by publishing together you defend against attack because again the strongest [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1646.0s)]
*  suit we have is truth and in order to guarantee that everything we say in our stories is true we [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1653.6s)]
*  have three fact checkers two full-time and what they do is that we we we go through every single [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1659.76s)]
*  story every story and we footnote every word of every story down to the point of does such and such [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1667.12s)]
*  have a beard is their car blue what's their dog's name and it will not get published by ICIJ if we [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1673.4399999999998s)]
*  say somebody has a beard when they have mutton chops it won't get published and the reason we [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1680.08s)]
*  do that is because that is our strongest defense because when we publish our stories there are a [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1684.72s)]
*  phallus of lawyers who will come after us sometimes as many as three or four lawyers for one person [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1690.3999999999999s)]
*  sending us letters and the people that are paying these lawyers have boundless resources often [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1698.48s)]
*  stolen resources sometimes billions of dollars that they have stolen and they can afford these [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1705.36s)]
*  lawyers and that's a separate issue altogether about the ethics of lawyers and cantons and [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1711.28s)]
*  money managers who are not my favorite people yeah yeah it's it's a i mean it's it's i mean so [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1715.84s)]
*  fantastic there are organizations like ICIJ that have that sort of rigor and it's increasingly rare [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1725.04s)]
*  to find that across the media like more and more publications don't have copy desks for instance [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1734.32s)]
*  they're just putting things online and then if there's an error they'll correct it after [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1741.68s)]
*  publication there's only less fact checking happening and it's also i think the you know [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1746.24s)]
*  there is going to counter a little what i said earlier but but i think the move to podcasting [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1753.68s)]
*  and audio and sort of visual formats definitely kind of makes fact checking not impossible but [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1759.6s)]
*  like more difficult when when there's not always a written record and you know there's [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1767.6s)]
*  you know when officials are making their statements on you know in the midst of three [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1775.76s)]
*  hour podcasts with you know a former MMA fighter or something as opposed to like [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1781.6s)]
*  you know an article in foreign affairs like it's they're both ways to get your message out one's [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1786.88s)]
*  like a little requires a little more of a lift that sort of go through and fact check and i think that [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1791.68s)]
*  just you know not to sound too pessimistic but you know there's less of a premium on on on that [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1798.3200000000002s)]
*  kind of rigor and being like extremely cautious and and just sort of less fact checking of [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1806.48s)]
*  public figures happening and as a consequence i think like a lot more people are just sort of [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1814.4s)]
*  accepting any form of journalism they hear as as opinion i think that there's [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1821.3600000000001s)]
*  there are fewer and fewer outlets people sort of depend on as as sort of trusted neutral voices [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1826.4s)]
*  as opposed to you know that's what they're just saying that because they hate the president or [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1831.44s)]
*  because they're trying to defend him yeah i think again if i think a lot of the jf's probably have [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1835.3600000000001s)]
*  been asked to fact check something i would say that like you know i started my career in journalism [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1840.16s)]
*  and at least at the time the first thing you did in an entry-level journalism job is [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1844.64s)]
*  you had to fact check and i stand by the older i get and the grumpier i become the more i'm like [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1848.8s)]
*  that is the most useful thing that anyone ever forced me to do because you see and i remember [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1854.64s)]
*  at one point very early in my career catching an error by someone very senior and it was like a big [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1859.68s)]
*  error and it was someone who really knew their stuff they were smart i don't think it was in [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1865.2s)]
*  bad faith i've seen some bad faith ones too but that was really humbling and i think it's something [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1868.24s)]
*  that i think about now which is like always always always check yourself and that reminder [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1873.2s)]
*  to to be careful and to be skeptical and so i think that that's you know it is both scary as [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1878.48s)]
*  you say that that's happening less and less and that also affects i think the way we should view [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1883.28s)]
*  what we're consuming even from reputable sources but it is also you know it's a lot of people [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1887.28s)]
*  are reputable sources but it is also you know a big thing so i think kind of going back to it you [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1892.24s)]
*  know like people in the research space we still have a little bit more luxury for that we we you [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1897.68s)]
*  know people who are trying to craft careers as experts maybe you know that's something that we [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1903.28s)]
*  can still do and probably should be doing so again kind of getting back to the question that i very [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1907.76s)]
*  inelegantly threw in there you know is that a place where maybe there's a valuable form of an [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1912.56s)]
*  interaction between people who have a little bit more luxury to be underscoring those like those [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1918.16s)]
*  facts the time and time again when we're engaging with people who are sort of just by nature of what [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1924.3200000000002s)]
*  you're doing sometimes you got to get things out more quickly it's not good i was just going to [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1928.64s)]
*  say it's definitely a truism in journalism and i assume in a think tank world or wherever you end [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1934.4s)]
*  up that people will remember the one mistake you made longer than the the the 10 things that you [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1939.28s)]
*  got right and we were when i joined axios we were only a couple weeks old and that was definitely [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1945.04s)]
*  you know the idea was out there that if we got one big one wrong very early on when nobody knew [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1950.96s)]
*  what the heck axios was that that was going to be you know potentially fatal to the to the you know [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1956.1599999999999s)]
*  growth of the organization so i you know but the the problem and i was thinking about this when [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1963.12s)]
*  when josh was talking is that a lot of the attacks that you will see will not be on the basis of the [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1967.6s)]
*  facts it won't be people going line by line and annotating oh this here was incorrect you know the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1973.28s)]
*  car was red rather than blue unfortunately very often it's about your motives as a reporter even [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1978.24s)]
*  from you know you get a story selection why are you covering this when the bigger scandal is this [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1983.84s)]
*  or you know you're only writing this because you know even the story that we did today which again [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1988.96s)]
*  was a pretty small one there we i made the mistake of scrolling through twitter and a lot of people [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1995.12s)]
*  were saying that it was on behalf of the deep state you know who wanted to [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=1999.44s)]
*  get tulsi gabbert out of office etc and it's you know wasn't but i i wish that we were [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2002.96s)]
*  engaging on the facts more than we were unfortunately too much of the discourse is about the the [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2010.96s)]
*  atmospherics rather than the fact but yes i think it's very very worthwhile even all of that said [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2016.3200000000002s)]
*  making a large factual error is costly in your career in your career as whatever you're doing [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2023.12s)]
*  and it's worth buttoning everything up before you press send i mean beyond the making mistakes [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2030.3999999999999s)]
*  question i i do think you know if you're somebody with expertise in a certain subject and you know [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2038.1599999999999s)]
*  you read an article and you know maybe you don't like the interpretation of it or you think it was [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2043.12s)]
*  um or you just think there's another aspect of it that they didn't get into that they could have [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2049.2799999999997s)]
*  like i always appreciate hearing from people about that um and if i you know i i love a good faith [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2054.0s)]
*  critique because i get so many bad faith ones that like like when somebody uh comes to me and um [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2061.9199999999996s)]
*  uh and in a polite friendly tone constructive tone um you know uh thanks uh they could offer [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2069.04s)]
*  something to my future reporting like i always appreciate that and and there are people who have [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2078.24s)]
*  become regular sources of mine that way and so um say whether you end up in think tanks or you know [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2082.7999999999997s)]
*  in the policy world like don't be afraid to um reach out to reporters i think we we we appreciate [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2088.64s)]
*  hearing from people when who have who actually have something to offer uh um for future reporting [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2095.8399999999997s)]
*  when you put something out into the void it's good when the void yells back i guess no matter [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2101.6s)]
*  what like at least you engaged with what i right yeah absolutely yeah right it's good right it's [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2105.04s)]
*  it's a good way to gauge the impact of it to know that uh people are reading it and interacting with [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2112.08s)]
*  it uh and that it's provoking some thoughts from them and that uh and i think that makes our jobs [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2117.12s)]
*  easier and helps us do better work going forward i think it's about it's about time to open up for [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2124.8s)]
*  some audience questions um okay we've got a mic there uh i think coming y'all are coming around [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2130.4s)]
*  okay it looks like we've got a question here great [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2139.44s)]
*  thank you so much my name is lillita i'm a recent graduate from university of michigan so i think [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2147.12s)]
*  rick has touched upon uh a little what i'm going to ask about um it's about the safety and security [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  of the journalists but i'm curious to hear from everyone else i was thinking hearing you how do [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2156.56s)]
*  you ensure the safety and security of your colleagues you work with especially sometimes [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2161.44s)]
*  when it's in very very sensitive topics with governments that not always love the work or [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2166.7999999999997s)]
*  not only governments but of the work that they do so that is one aspect and then also what about [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2173.2s)]
*  the emotional and psychological security of people especially in a in such a polarized media world [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2178.48s)]
*  that we live in thank you i can do a little bit the first so on safety and security um [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2184.56s)]
*  the security information we we take very seriously i'll move to people in a second but with information [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2193.2799999999997s)]
*  we're using encryption all the time we use signal we use whatsapp we our our own systems are attacked [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2198.7999999999997s)]
*  every time we do a project by china and russia typically not always with them so there and we [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2205.12s)]
*  repel them because we have an it team that's really good at repelling uh in terms of safety [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2209.84s)]
*  of reporters that's a really difficult issue and it's one that's getting you know it's getting [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2214.96s)]
*  exponentially worse um typically what happens is the reporters leave the country which is [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2219.2000000000003s)]
*  a really sad outcome um we've had one of our former colleagues machu caruana galicia his mom [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2225.1200000000003s)]
*  was blown up in malta uh somebody that we uh didn't work with directly but we worked with many of the [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2232.48s)]
*  people that he worked with jan kuziak was uh shot dead with his girlfriend in uh slovakia uh we [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2238.88s)]
*  as i said our our partners are routinely uh harassed and and so it's it's it's an ongoing [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2248.7200000000003s)]
*  problem and that you know there's a huge problem and then that's china you know there's basically [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2256.08s)]
*  no chinese reporters anymore there's there's so in the way that there are news deserts here in [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2261.2000000000003s)]
*  america say but where where local newspapers have collapsed as a consequence both of the the [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2266.72s)]
*  the collapse of funding for international uh true international aid for reporting there's now news [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2273.12s)]
*  deserts in entire countries the ukraine i think has because of the closure of usa id has probably [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2278.64s)]
*  lost about 90 percent of its reporters so there are uh just very basically people leave the countries [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2283.8399999999997s)]
*  people work for uh we with other news organizations within within our orbit we publish stories if we [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2291.68s)]
*  can't publish a story in ecuador we'll publish in bolivia to give protection to the people in [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2299.2s)]
*  ecuador we take people's names off stories sometimes we just did a story on transnational [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2303.04s)]
*  repression whilst we were doing the story on transnational repression it was about china [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2307.3599999999997s)]
*  we took several reporters names off the stories uh because if it's too dangerous for them we take [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2310.96s)]
*  huge cautions around the protections of sources the absolute last thing we want to do is to have [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2317.52s)]
*  a source jailed we did finn sent files which was one of the biggest projects in the world the source [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2322.7200000000003s)]
*  of that was buzzfeed's source unfortunately she did go to jail so there with every project there's [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2327.52s)]
*  a range of protecting sources um this administration right now is talking a lot about going after [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2334.16s)]
*  leakers um and so i think we all of us when we have had sources um you know speak to us off the [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2340.56s)]
*  record or on deep background or whatever on whatever terms there's an implicit understanding [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2349.92s)]
*  that you will not reveal them under any circumstances that's the you know the general [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2354.64s)]
*  rule uh i we have not gotten to a point i think where this administration is uh you know it has [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2361.04s)]
*  happened even under previous administrations where journalists are compelled to reveal their [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2368.32s)]
*  sources um uh you know that we've had conversations in our newsroom about uh you know our our legal [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2373.04s)]
*  team our a couple editors sat us down and said you need to take this very seriously like the idea [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2379.92s)]
*  that if you're you know you will stand behind the reporting and and protect the source uh and that [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2384.96s)]
*  is now suddenly a conversation that seems less hypothetical than it maybe did uh when i first [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2391.6s)]
*  started in journalism um yeah um i'll take this i don't have much to add on on the physical safety [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2398.4s)]
*  to what um farga said but in terms of just sort of mental health and uh maintaining sort of emotional [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2407.36s)]
*  stability i think an important you know as you know particularly since covid so much has moved [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2414.8s)]
*  online and so many newsrooms are effectively virtual now i think that there's fewer fewer of [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2421.6000000000004s)]
*  what you're saying like the sort of personal interactions with colleagues and i think um [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2427.28s)]
*  i think being in a world where where all you're dealing with are like names on a screen or or [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2433.6000000000004s)]
*  even voices on a telephone uh and not speaking to people uh uh not just your sources but colleagues [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2438.24s)]
*  that when you encounter you know that kind of negativity uh online it it it can take a [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2446.3999999999996s)]
*  greater toll on you and so i you know i hope that organizations sort of uh not not in a coercive way [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2453.2799999999997s)]
*  but you know encourage real world interaction and i think it's like healthy for um for their [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2460.24s)]
*  workforces and i hope that um journalists sort of seek out those two as tempting as it is to [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2467.12s)]
*  you know just sit at home on your laptop and um stare into the the digital void all day [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2472.3199999999997s)]
*  one very quick bright spot on that i will say when i wrote a newsletter for several years for axios [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2478.24s)]
*  it came from my my personal email so people and there was a little bit of personal touches to it [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2481.92s)]
*  so people knew they were interacting with a human being rather than with a news institution and i [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2486.72s)]
*  found that the incoming that i got directly from newsletter subscribers was 97 of it was either [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2490.56s)]
*  very kind or engaging seriously with the material i think people don't a lot of times the negativity [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2498.08s)]
*  is is coming at the idea of the media or whatever and then but once it's you put a face to it [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2505.7599999999998s)]
*  however you can uh in some circumstances it's helpful [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2511.36s)]
*  um [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2514.4s)]
*  max barnes i work next door at a on great power competition uh one of the things that just came [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2529.28s)]
*  through in passing was uh members of the panel's own media consumption i was just consider uh [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2534.96s)]
*  curious i guess uh aside from your own outlets what's what are you know one or two things that [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2540.72s)]
*  you either read watch or listen to that are consistently really informative or the format [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2546.56s)]
*  is very creative and interesting um i'm not sure if this is going to help you because i [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2551.8399999999997s)]
*  i read everything about australia because i lived there for a long time i read everything about [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2561.68s)]
*  ireland and i read everything about america so i'm constantly non-stop so i read the washington [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2566.64s)]
*  post the guy the and the belfast telegraph i listen to the belfast telegraph podcast which is great [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2572.16s)]
*  even if you know nothing about belfast uh so i i'm just a news hog i will just absorb news from [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2577.44s)]
*  everywhere one of my first jobs at fp was writing what at that point was called the morning brief [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2585.04s)]
*  newsletter which was really just like i mean it was mostly a collection of links and i'd get to [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2591.2799999999997s)]
*  write a little like two or three paragraph thing up top but i you know you had to have three stories [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2595.84s)]
*  from every region so i had to have like three america stories africa and i haven't done that [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2601.04s)]
*  in years but i think that like habit of that being like the first way i consume news in the [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2606.6400000000003s)]
*  morning kind of stuck a little bit so i um i tend to start just with wire services like but even [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2611.92s)]
*  and that i try i try to like read the news before i go on twitter and see what everybody's saying [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2618.08s)]
*  about it so um i think that's like a useful exercise and um and i think there's such a like [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2623.28s)]
*  sometimes um you know it's it's a little bit like little kids playing soccer it's like [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2631.2000000000003s)]
*  10 people clustered around the ball like that's the way the media feels sometimes like everybody's [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2637.76s)]
*  chasing the new shiny object someday so i think like making an effort you know if i haven't [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2642.0800000000004s)]
*  written anything about africa in a while or latin america like i sort of make a conscious effort [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2646.88s)]
*  to do that because i i do have a very like generalist portfolio where i'm writing about [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2655.36s)]
*  like foreign policy writ large so that means i uh if i'm not just going to be like you know [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2659.52s)]
*  chasing the ball i have to um uh make a special effort to broaden it out but in terms of where i [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2666.32s)]
*  i get like a ton of newsletters now including several from axios that um they uh that that [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2674.6400000000003s)]
*  that's maybe been like the biggest change in the last couple years that i'm consuming a lot more [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2680.7200000000003s)]
*  news uh through my inbox than i used to yeah i'm a heavy uh podcast listener as i mentioned before [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2684.7200000000003s)]
*  i mean i think that my news diet to start the day is pretty traditional i think lately the the [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2690.6400000000003s)]
*  journal has been getting a lot of stories that i'm saying i wish we had that you know we wrote that [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2695.84s)]
*  one first a couple of the real big newsrooms are you know they have those reputations for a reason [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2701.84s)]
*  and they're breaking a lot of a lot of news uh every day that's not necessarily breaking through [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2706.6400000000003s)]
*  because everybody's focused on la and you know whatever else is happening but if you want to [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2711.6000000000004s)]
*  find out what's happening in the national security space you could do worse than starting with the [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2715.44s)]
*  the journal in the times and the the broadsheet so i'll stick my hand up for mainstream media [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2718.88s)]
*  it's one of the things which i mean these guys have reminded me of play with the algorithm [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2725.92s)]
*  so you're you're being fed stuff particularly on social media you're like it's not your it's [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2731.44s)]
*  because you've looked at something before it's giving you two again and it won't change they [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2736.8799999999997s)]
*  do it when if you say for instance if you're like comedians and you look at nate burgatsi you're [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2741.44s)]
*  going to get thousands of nate burgatsi you're not going to be able to escape nate burgatsi or he's [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2746.3199999999997s)]
*  going to come at you from everywhere facebook twitter social everything he's going to come in [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2750.96s)]
*  but if you play with the algorithm by indulging a different interest so instead of nate burgatsi [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2754.8s)]
*  and for instance a comedian in south africa you'll get him so or her and so that's it play with the [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2761.76s)]
*  algorithm because the algorithm will corral you into into something and you can have a much [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2767.1200000000003s)]
*  richer life if you if you if you feud with it yeah and i think one of the dangerous aspects of that [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2773.76s)]
*  is it will give you news that you agree with as well which i have found like you know even if [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2780.4s)]
*  it's a sports team that i follow or whatever it'll be you know it's it's not every side of the [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2786.1600000000003s)]
*  conversation and stuff that it thinks that you will that you will agree with which is unhealthy [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2790.08s)]
*  for our media ecosystem in general but that's not a tip that's just a depressing thought it helps a [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2795.04s)]
*  lot to just go to the actual website i mean it's like a very old-fashioned way now to like conserve [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2800.1600000000003s)]
*  media but i find when i do that i like come across stories that i would never have found [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2806.4s)]
*  because they just wouldn't wouldn't be a bit to me by my algorithm i think the idea of feuding [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2813.2799999999997s)]
*  with the algorithm is great i'm gonna think about that oh man i want to feud with mine now [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2818.56s)]
*  first thank you all so much for being here you've each mentioned different developments that have [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2829.04s)]
*  been transformative in the journalism industry over the past you know few decades and i'm curious [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2833.84s)]
*  about your predictions for the next five to ten years how you imagine ai changing things [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2839.28s)]
*  the transition of many writers at established institutions to sub stack just any predictions [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2846.4s)]
*  you have for these coming years the the sub stack effect ebbs and flows i think i think there were [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2854.4s)]
*  there was like a peak a conversation a few years ago that everybody was going to be their own brand [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2860.4s)]
*  and like the general media big you know the the sort of big players in media wouldn't matter as [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2864.32s)]
*  much and it turns out that it's very hard to make a sustainable business unless you're one of the [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2869.84s)]
*  like 10 people with the biggest uh sub stacks i think that it turns out it's it's good to have [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2874.1600000000003s)]
*  a big news organization that will fund your reporting behind you in most cases but i do [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2878.7200000000003s)]
*  think there is a real element of people finding ways to build their own personal brand rather [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2882.96s)]
*  than growing within the the company they work for i think in terms of ai i'm borrowing this [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2887.84s)]
*  from our ceo who talks about this he basically says that new information you have to reveal [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2892.96s)]
*  genuinely new information in your reporting because ai is not going to you know if you have a [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2897.76s)]
*  behind the scenes of you know what what trump said in a meeting about iran that doesn't exist on the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2903.36s)]
*  internet yet ai is not going to replace that actual reporting you know revealing information [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2909.92s)]
*  will will be at a premium as well as you know really high level expertise where people want [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2915.04s)]
*  to go to you to know what you think of of a particular development so we have an economics [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2920.1600000000003s)]
*  correspondent named miller when it came to us from the times and and people want to know when [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2925.92s)]
*  when the fed makes a decision they want to know what does he what does he think about it so so [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2930.56s)]
*  that's a that's a good way to to differentiate yourself from whatever chat gpt is spitting out [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2934.64s)]
*  but for those of us who are who are i spend most of my days editing these days and chat gpt is not [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2939.44s)]
*  great but i every every once in a while will feed a story in there just to see what it would suggest [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2945.44s)]
*  and it's getting better in real time like i it's troubling to me a little bit i i don't think that [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2950.0s)]
*  editors are going to go away but i think we will definitely be reckoning reckoning with ai as an [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2956.64s)]
*  industry over the next while and i think it's going to be you know especially for [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2963.76s)]
*  i don't want to monopolize the conversation about ai with somebody else that's already kind of [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2971.36s)]
*  changed the way we do our jobs i think i mean when when i was like working up here as an intern then [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2976.32s)]
*  an editorial system i mean a big part of what i did was transcribing interviews like i wanted [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2982.96s)]
*  to do a q and a with some big important person and like they would give it to me to actually [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2989.12s)]
*  type out what something i say i don't think that job exists anymore and so you know that definitely [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=2995.12s)]
*  like makes things faster for me but uh you know i do wonder sometimes like some of those early [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3002.56s)]
*  pathway like first get you in the door newsroom jobs like if some of those tasks are being [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3008.6400000000003s)]
*  automated away i wonder what that sort of means for um people trying to sort of get in the door [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3015.2s)]
*  and you know it's it's more and more news i mean i probably shouldn't comment on it but like box [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3022.88s)]
*  right now is in the midst of like labor negotiations between our uh union management and a big topic of [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3029.44s)]
*  contention is over ai protections uh and like we're not the first company that's dealt with that [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3035.04s)]
*  there have been several several cases of this so i think it's uh we're still kind of like absorbing [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3041.9199999999996s)]
*  what the impact of that is for for our jobs but you know i agree with what they've said i mean i [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3047.7599999999998s)]
*  don't think it can replace um unearthing new facts uh putting the work in to do research although [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3055.3599999999997s)]
*  i'm sure you're using those tools a lot more than used to and i i don't think it like personal voice [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3062.0s)]
*  and having uh you know wanting to know what like a certain person thinks or their their interpretation [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3067.6s)]
*  of events i mean i think that that's something that i hope at least there will still be a premium on [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3073.04s)]
*  um we i mean we've all been true unimaginable changes in journalism in the last 20 years [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3078.56s)]
*  30 years um so and i expect that that's going to speed up and in 10 years it'll be unrecognizable [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3087.12s)]
*  um so it used to be that the person who could use the spreadsheet was the investigative [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3093.76s)]
*  reporter and then it was the person who could use the special computer was the investigative [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3097.84s)]
*  reporter and now anyone can be and you know share information at the same time it used to be that if [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3101.6000000000004s)]
*  you got a letter in the post with some information you were excited now you get 12 million documents [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3108.4s)]
*  so it's like there's it's journalism is unrecognizable from 10 years ago and it'll [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3114.4s)]
*  be unrecognizable in 10 years from now the ai will will do it'll achieve wonderful things it [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3119.84s)]
*  will be amazing in many ways so i'll give you one small tiny example when we get 12 million [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3126.2400000000002s)]
*  documents we have to identify people in it ai can pull out passports when you you open an offshore [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3131.52s)]
*  account you you provide a passport or an electricity bill it can pull out a passport and if you have a [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3136.6400000000003s)]
*  passport you're away because if you have a passport you know it's vladimir putin not somebody else [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3141.6000000000004s)]
*  who's called vladimir putin and and and that that's a critical error you don't want to get [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3146.24s)]
*  a milkman in moscow into trouble okay so uh although we have previously found two artists [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3150.4799999999996s)]
*  with 300 million dollars in their accounts so that's you know you never know what's going to [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3156.4799999999996s)]
*  happen but so ai can transform things because they can pull out passports in seconds which you [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3160.64s)]
*  would have taken weeks or months so that's the transformation but that where it scares me is [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3166.08s)]
*  that we are already for journalists in a really precarious position where there are very few [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3172.96s)]
*  younger journalists there are very few opportunities there are very few local newspapers local radio [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3177.52s)]
*  stations are closing down and my concern is that ai will further decimate journalism and that is [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3182.2400000000002s)]
*  not good for democracy yeah i think we got time for one more um you right there hi uh my name is [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3191.84s)]
*  nate newstatt i work here in dc for an organization called peace works more on the topic of the ai [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3201.28s)]
*  conversation with the rise of deep fakes and ai especially in war and election reportings how are [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3207.44s)]
*  you seeing that as negatively affecting your job and work life and what are you as journalists [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3213.1200000000003s)]
*  doing to combat that so that the actual truth is getting out instead of all of these dis and [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3218.5600000000004s)]
*  misinformation campaigns taking over the mainstream media uh you guys i'll just make one quick point [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3224.1600000000003s)]
*  a lot of the stuff that's fooling people is not the super sophisticated stuff unfortunately at [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3231.52s)]
*  this point like a lot of the stuff that's spreading around if you have uh certainly if you're a [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3236.3199999999997s)]
*  professional journalist but also if you have a degree of media literacy you can probably [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3240.96s)]
*  recognize that a lot of the stuff that people are sharing is actually slop and is not real [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3244.56s)]
*  and yet you'll see the number of shares below it and it'll blow your mind that this many people [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3249.04s)]
*  are consuming that that information so like i i am scared about the idea that this technology [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3253.7599999999998s)]
*  is going to get super super sophisticated and it'll be very hard even for somebody who covers [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3258.48s)]
*  conflict professionally to know if this image is coming from the war that they spend their days [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3262.56s)]
*  covering but at the moment a lot of the stuff that i'm seeing fooling people is just like [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3267.52s)]
*  you know bad and not like that's yeah i mean you know i i can remember like the twitter revolution [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3273.04s)]
*  and you know that that phrasing being used in this idea that like social media was [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3280.56s)]
*  and it was for a long time like when the arab spring protest happened there was an incredible [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3284.56s)]
*  resource to be able to follow these events in real time the way we never had before but [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3289.2s)]
*  you know trying this week to follow the la situation on social media is just like [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3293.6s)]
*  hopeless like just just read the la times you know don't uh because you know you'll get ai slop [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3301.2799999999997s)]
*  you'll get um you know pictures from protests that happened five years ago it's uh and and uh [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3308.24s)]
*  so it's much much harder i think to like use those tools as just a way to follow the nulls and and i [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3316.3999999999996s)]
*  and i'm worried too about malign actors kind of weapon i you know because these models um these [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3322.72s)]
*  large language models are only as good as the information that goes into them and i i think [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3329.7599999999998s)]
*  there's definitely you know there's already reporting on you know sort of russian government [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3334.88s)]
*  operations trying to sort of seed ai models with uh their preferred narratives and so i think we're [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3339.36s)]
*  going to see a lot more of that of people trying to sort of weaponize these things i think we're [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3345.52s)]
*  we're all going to have to be pretty vigilant about it it's deeply concerning to us years ago [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3349.12s)]

*  said they were at the time they were did they give a speech at the time they did [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxinrkmC3yk&t=3371.12s)]
