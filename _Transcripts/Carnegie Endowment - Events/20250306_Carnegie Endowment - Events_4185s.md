Video Description: As the United States and Australia face an increasingly turbulent world, they should have an unparalleled opportunity to fashion a broader, stronger, and multilayered partnership. The rise of Chinese power, economic uncertainty, and technological disruption make strengthening this alliance an urgent priority. But despite a shared history and broad bipartisan support for the alliance in both countries, critical deficiencies in current defense strategies and operational coordination must be remedied.  

Amid the prospect of high-intensity conflict in the Indo-Pacific, can Canberra and Washington align their regional defense strategies to effectively advance shared military objectives? How might the alliance balance sovereignty concerns in Australia and strategic risk thresholds with the need to combine certain strategies and plans? What operational roles can each partner take on? And can this alliance innovate and lead multinational joint deterrence forces? 

Authors of the Carnegie Asia Program’s recent volume, Alliance Future: Rewiring Australia and the United States, will discuss the future of the alliance, opportunities for partnership, and strategies to address potential pitfalls.

# Reforming and Realigning the U.S.-Australia Alliance
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM)
*  Well, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, good afternoon or good evening, depending [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=0.0s)]
*  on where in the world you happen to be. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=15.58s)]
*  I'm Evan Feigenbaum. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=18.18s)]
*  I'm Vice President for Studies at Carnegie. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=19.38s)]
*  And if you've been reading the news and not living under a rock, you may well think that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=22.86s)]
*  it's a tough time for American alliances from Canada to Europe and beyond. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=28.06s)]
*  But the thing about alliances is that their roots are deeper than your average relationship. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=33.379999999999995s)]
*  And so it is with the U.S.-Australia alliance, which has decades of shared history and roots [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=38.2s)]
*  that are, in fact, deeper than pretty much any other American alliance I can think of. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=43.4s)]
*  So the current moment may turn out to be a summer squall or something a hell of a lot [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  bigger. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=55.18s)]
*  But it's important to perpetually refresh alliances in any case, to recommit to their [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=56.46s)]
*  purpose and to deepen their roots. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=62.6s)]
*  And that's what we're all here to do. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=64.68s)]
*  So by way of background, last year, we at Carnegie launched a comprehensive review of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=67.76s)]
*  the defense-related aspects of the U.S.-Australia alliance with chapters on strategy, force [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=73.44s)]
*  and innovation, alliance roles and missions, and coalition building. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=81.72s)]
*  And I'm joined today by all but one of our authors. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  We've got Matt Sussex, Courtney Stewart, Stefan Frueling, Stacy Pettijohn, and Peter Tesh, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=90.66s)]
*  missing only Jennifer Jackett, who's gone into the Australian government service and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=97.48s)]
*  can't be with us. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=101.94s)]
*  What I'm going to do is round Robin with them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=103.7s)]
*  We'll have a little bit of crosstalk among ourselves, and then we'll try and leave as [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  much time as we can to take some questions from the audience. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=111.08s)]
*  But from my vantage point, as the curator and editor of this volume and a longtime participant, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=115.32s)]
*  both when I was in government and out of government in strategic interactions between the U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  and Australia, I'll give you two pieces of good news at the top. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=127.88s)]
*  First, we have a storied history of sending our forces into combat and then fighting shoulder [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=133.98s)]
*  to shoulder, beginning, as the historians among you will know, in 1918 with the Battle [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=139.94s)]
*  of Hamel, where U.S. forces actually served under an Australian commander. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  Many Americans don't know that, General Sir John Monash. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=151.1s)]
*  Second, this alliance happens to be completely bipartisan on both sides. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=154.06s)]
*  In Australia, the Labor Party claims it by hearkening back to Prime Minister John Curtin's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=160.08s)]
*  December 1941 declaration that Australia looks to America. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  And the liberals and nationals can claim it, because a decade later it was Robert Menzies [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=169.9s)]
*  who signed the Anzistry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=174.02s)]
*  And on the American side, there's been broad and deep bipartisan support for decades. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=175.88s)]
*  And if I may say so, especially today on both sides of the aisle in Congress. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  But, and this is designed to set up our conversation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=186.04s)]
*  There's also some tougher news. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=189.74s)]
*  For one, our forces have fought together in the field, but we don't have as much history [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=192.08s)]
*  divvying up roles and missions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=197.24s)]
*  And those two things are not the same. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=199.52s)]
*  And so they risk creating some expectation gaps that we've tried to address in this volume. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=202.6s)]
*  There's another piece of tougher news, which is our strategic preferences are closely aligned, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  that they're not identical, despite what some people in Washington seem to think. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=213.88s)]
*  The U.S. is very focused on integrating Australian forces into American war plans. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  But as Matt and Peter say in their chapter, and I hope we're going to talk about, no government [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=225.04s)]
*  in Australia is going to outsource sovereign choices about war and deployments to the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  So a lot of people seem to think that if you shout China, China very, very loudly, it will [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=236.48s)]
*  overcome these operational issues automatically with a Harry Potter-like magic wand. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=242.12s)]
*  But we're here to tell you, and if you read the volume, you will see that that's not enough. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  It takes work to build coordinated strategy, posture, roles, missions, and plans. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=252.92s)]
*  And that's what we've done in this volume with a lot of prescription. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=259.58s)]
*  So we're not focused on rah-rah-ing the relationship. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=262.76s)]
*  The mateship is pretty self-evident when you get American and Australian warfighters together. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=266.28s)]
*  Deterrence and defense require a lot of introspection and prescription. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=270.6s)]
*  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to run through each of our authors who has joined us, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  starting with Matt Sussex and then Peter Tesh, his co-author, if Peter's Wi-Fi is working well [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=279.88s)]
*  for Murrah, Australia. And they're going to talk a little bit about how to align our respective [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  defense strategies for better effect. I hope everybody in the audience reads the volume. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  Matt, you and Peter kick us off with a few minutes on strategy and then we'll work our way through. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=295.8s)]
*  Matt, can I turn it over to you? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=301.8s)]
*  Yeah, excellent. Many thanks, Evan. I'm just checking that everybody can hear me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=304.04s)]
*  That seems to be working okay. Cool. Yeah, look, I just wanted to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=310.44s)]
*  to echo what Evan was saying about the sort of ties that bind being more enduring than just [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=314.2s)]
*  one particular few years in history. It's certainly the case that as the former Australian Prime [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=322.52s)]
*  Minister, Kevin Rudd, now, of course, Australia's ambassador in Washington, D.C., frantically trying [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=329.64s)]
*  to make sure that the current administration is alive to two issues relating to AUKUS, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=335.64s)]
*  apparently doing quite well with the exception that when the President was asked about AUKUS [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=343.0s)]
*  the other day, he said, what's that? But there's certainly good knowledge of it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=347.48s)]
*  at other levels of the administration. No, Rudd referred to the US-Australia [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=352.68s)]
*  security partnership as the bedrock of our strategic policy. And I think that's right [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=359.32s)]
*  and continues to be so. But also, as Evan says, you know, those bedrocks, you know, while they might [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=365.32s)]
*  frame and define what you do, it doesn't necessarily mean that it shapes every single [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=373.0s)]
*  decision and every single action. So in this chapter, what Peter and I wanted to do [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=379.56s)]
*  was to have a look a little bit more at a little bit more deeply at some of those practical [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=387.08s)]
*  aspects relating to strategies that might need some attention. And generally speaking, looking [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=392.68s)]
*  at themes of where is it that we are converging and where potentially is it that we're diverging? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=399.64s)]
*  Because that's equally important, too, and needs to be addressed. So the first kind of finding that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=406.52s)]
*  we had out of this was that in trying to better enmesh American and Australian defense strategies, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=413.64s)]
*  it has to be, I think, acknowledged from the get-go that we do have slightly different on a variety of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=422.68s)]
*  things, slightly different interests, slightly different threat perceptions, and certainly, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=431.56s)]
*  obviously, quite significantly different capabilities. Now, it doesn't mean they're [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  not closely aligned. They are. And we are moving towards integration and so forth. But, you know, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=442.84s)]
*  it doesn't necessarily mean that they're identical. So I think the main takeaway from the first bit [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  of the analysis is that Australia's support for future American-led combat operations [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=458.44s)]
*  shouldn't be assumed, shouldn't be automatically assumed. They're actually going to have to make [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=465.24s)]
*  the case that this is something that's in Australia's national interests, whether that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=469.32s)]
*  contingency is over, say, Taiwan or whether it's something else. Australian capabilities [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=476.20000000000005s)]
*  will really only be used, I think, if there's an absolute and obvious vital Australian interest at [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  stake, rather than simply performing alliance maintenance or alliance loyalty functions, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=489.32000000000005s)]
*  as perhaps some operations might be sort of characterized that happened in the past. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  So moving from that, the second thing we talked about in our paper, and with that sort of caveat [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=500.68s)]
*  about not assuming that Australia will always be there necessarily, we thought the best way to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=506.92s)]
*  help synergize Australian and US defense strategies within a regional context was to focus on effects. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=512.84s)]
*  What effect are you trying to generate? And this mirrors, I think, a fair bit of what [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=521.64s)]
*  the thinking has been in parts of the Australian defense community and the Australian strategic [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=527.88s)]
*  policy community. It's not necessarily the case that Australia can produce, we're not a great [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=532.76s)]
*  power, maximal deterrence in a sort of, both in crisis phases and in non-crisis phases, but what [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=539.16s)]
*  we can seek to engender are certain particular types of deterrent effects. And so we look at that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=546.52s)]
*  in some detail with sort of cleaving the sort of tasks for Australian and American policymakers [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=553.24s)]
*  into three buckets, I suppose. We look at resources, we look at relationships, and we look at resilience. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=561.0799999999999s)]
*  Now, that's nicely alliterative, but it, I think, goes to the crux of the three areas where there [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=569.88s)]
*  might be some sort of a potential for a change in the relationship between Australia and the US. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=576.6s)]
*  The three areas where there might be potential divergence. So what types of capabilities [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=581.8s)]
*  do you have and do you not have you might need to acquire? What types of relationships do you have? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=587.4799999999999s)]
*  What are your networks like? Where are you better off in terms of being able to advocate for a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=592.68s)]
*  particular alliance relationship as being beneficial for the region? Where might you be [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=597.88s)]
*  a little bit more shaky? And how can you build sort of resilience within the relationship? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  And I think that having a focus like that helps us to sort of sharpen the types of opportunities [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  that might facilitate regional military security cooperation that goes beyond the alliance. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=618.52s)]
*  That isn't just simply a hub and a spoke, but includes things like, you know, spoke to spoke [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=625.64s)]
*  cooperation using the old San Francisco system sort of lingo. And how can then you reach out not just [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=631.4s)]
*  to the low hanging fruit, other US treaty allies within the region, but countries that might be [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=639.56s)]
*  considered like minded friends and partners and so on. And I think by doing that, you can enhance [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=644.8399999999999s)]
*  both deterrence as well as supporting a sense of strategic stability. And so I commend that chapter [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=652.1199999999999s)]
*  to you. I think I've rattled on long enough. Peter, do you have anything to add to that? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=660.92s)]
*  I think we've just Peter's about to come back on because he's got somewhat unstable internet. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=666.76s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to give this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=671.8s)]
*  What would you can hear me? Yeah, Peter. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  All right. Peter, Matt was asking you, we can now was asking whether you want to add anything, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=682.5999999999999s)]
*  but I'm also wondering if you can pull the thread on this term you guys use in the chapter about [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=688.28s)]
*  aligning for effect. Talk a little bit about what you mean by effect and where you see that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=692.36s)]
*  the opportunities for greater alignment. OK, well. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=699.08s)]
*  Yeah, look, thank thank you. I think the key issue here is that third element that Matt has [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=703.88s)]
*  illuminated, namely resilience. And we've set out in the paper a number of points, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=711.08s)]
*  and he's touched on some of those. I think one of the great evolutions that I've observed in [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=716.76s)]
*  Australian defense and national security and indeed foreign policy is a shift in focus away [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=721.08s)]
*  from grand strategies to what is it we're seeking to achieve. What impact are we trying to have? Is [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=726.2s)]
*  it deterrence? Is it denial? Is it shaping? And therefore, I think we need to bring that lens set [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=730.84s)]
*  much more sharply to bear upon our collaboration with the United States in order to see a greater [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=737.48s)]
*  mutually reinforcing effect that we have in our respective interactions in the region. And this [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=744.44s)]
*  of course is at this time some doubt and uncertainty given the flux and the turbulence that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=751.1600000000001s)]
*  we're seeing emanating from Washington DC at the moment. So I think what we need is to recognize [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=758.76s)]
*  that no single nation is going to be able to achieve a desired effect. And we need to become [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=765.0s)]
*  a lot better at not just having the US and what in the eyes of many in the region is the sub branch [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=771.32s)]
*  office Australia out there chattering away in our immediate region. So from that perspective, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=777.72s)]
*  I think we can look at much more effectively engaging and trying to integrate our strategies [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=783.88s)]
*  and our actions with similarly minded, if not precisely like minded partners in the region, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=789.4s)]
*  particularly countries like Vietnam, particularly countries that are much more vulnerable to the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=796.28s)]
*  effects of would be hegemons. And that includes selective members of ASEAN. Obviously Indonesia [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=802.04s)]
*  remains a challenge for all of us because of its very stalwart policy. But I think there is a need [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=807.88s)]
*  for us in Australia and for the United States as well to focus much more on what we need to do with [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=814.8399999999999s)]
*  Indonesia, particularly because if we start to see tensions heightening and the prospects of [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=820.12s)]
*  military or near military activity, access over flight basing becomes absolutely critical. And [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=826.2s)]
*  we can't just whistle those up when we need them. And to achieve those, we need greater investment [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=832.28s)]
*  across all of the domains and across many of the agencies and areas, not just gray holes and gray [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=837.5600000000001s)]
*  tails. So this needs to be, I think, a much more integrated view coming out of Washington as well. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=843.64s)]
*  I'm of the most recent decisions around USAID and similar moves by the Trump administration [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=851.1600000000001s)]
*  or very badly for being able to bring all of the instruments of influence and power [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=856.2800000000001s)]
*  that the US commands to bear upon this issue. And before I go to Stefan, do you guys feel like [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=861.1600000000001s)]
*  the political climate in Australia? Let's put the United States to the side and come back to that, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=868.44s)]
*  especially because you're in an election year. Do you feel like the political climate in Australia [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=873.88s)]
*  is conducive to that kind of strategic conversation? But also, whether the processes [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=878.1199999999999s)]
*  like the defense strategic review that have been done have brought us far enough toward that point, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=883.9599999999999s)]
*  what does the next government have to do no matter who wins the election? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=887.88s)]
*  That's for either one of you. I lost a bit of your sound there, so I might let Matt [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=893.3199999999999s)]
*  slip into the gap. But just picking up on where you landed, when you came on audio, for me at least, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=900.3599999999999s)]
*  I think the thing that is happening in that country is there is broadly bipartisan [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=908.52s)]
*  agreement about the nature of the strategic environment and what is degrading. And we still [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=917.0s)]
*  insist on playing the politics around defense and national security, recognizing as a former [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=922.76s)]
*  defense minister said once in my presence, the great thing about being a minister for defense [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=928.3599999999999s)]
*  is you get to implement and apologize for the decision of your predecessors. But I think broadly [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=931.96s)]
*  is a sense that we do need to adopt this sort of approach. But the big difference, of course, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=938.2800000000001s)]
*  is evident in the pronounced emphasis the labor government makes upon stabilizing relationship [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=943.96s)]
*  with China, which is often I think misinterpreted as kowtowing to China. But I think certainly [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=951.0s)]
*  we are going to have some difficulties in practical terms because all of the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=957.9599999999999s)]
*  polling would suggest that we're not going to have a compelling majority government of either flavor [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=962.4399999999999s)]
*  in Australia after the upcoming federal election. And that will mean nuance and picking arguments [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=967.9599999999999s)]
*  and political fights domestically. And I think that will create some risk that others will see [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=973.9599999999999s)]
*  opportunity to exploit. Matt? Yeah, look, I think that covers that pretty well. I mean, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=980.12s)]
*  it's interesting that we are in this sort of holding pattern before an actual election. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=987.08s)]
*  But active campaigning has already begun. And we've already seen bits of sort of national [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=994.12s)]
*  security and defense become politicized within that process. And a good example was the recent [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1001.72s)]
*  Chinese flotilla, which has been circumnavigating Australia after holding some live fire drills off [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1010.12s)]
*  the coast of Sydney. There is a keen appetite within the current government to make sure that [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1017.32s)]
*  is not seen as being weak on defense and security and a keen, equally keen appetite on behalf of the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1023.0s)]
*  opposition to ensure that the current government is seen as weak. But the question is, of course, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1030.68s)]
*  what you actually do about it. And that's more of a capability question than anything else. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1037.16s)]
*  And I think it's interesting to see that with various proposals that have been put forward from [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1042.28s)]
*  both sides of politics as to what you would do with this. Labor talking about sort of more long [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1049.48s)]
*  range fires, the coalition talking about more F-35s, is that the root cause of the problem still [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1055.56s)]
*  is something that has quite enduring bipartisan support for, or mutual understanding. It's just [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1062.6s)]
*  the detail on how you get there. The one thing I'd add actually that Peter mentioned, I think, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1071.24s)]
*  was worthwhile was around also that this thinking, it would be very helpful if it did permeate [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1077.08s)]
*  in Washington as well. Because one of the things that we didn't see as a result of [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1084.68s)]
*  the Chinese doing live fire drills off the coast of Sydney in the Tasman Sea, which they have every [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1092.04s)]
*  right to be there if they want to, but every point to be if they want to send a message, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1098.12s)]
*  not just to Australia, but also to test out how attentive the new administration in the White House [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1104.76s)]
*  is. And the fact that, whereas I think previous administrations probably would have jumped on [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1111.9599999999998s)]
*  this quite quickly, we had relative silence from DC and from Indo-Pacon. And that's something that [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1116.84s)]
*  I think has probably raised a few eyebrows in Canberra. So there is not just that issue of how [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1124.76s)]
*  you align for effect, but also how you get your messaging right and how you ensure that you are [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1131.8799999999999s)]
*  both basically on brand when it comes to calling out bad behavior within the region. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1139.72s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. Stefan, I want to go to you next, because you wrote on Forest Polyterp, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1145.08s)]
*  which I always think is the underrated star of the Alliance. And there have been all these exciting [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1151.64s)]
*  forest posture initiatives over the last few years. So there's the Marines in Darwin, there's [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1157.64s)]
*  Submarine Rotational Force West. And Stacey will confirm this. When you're sitting on this side of [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1161.24s)]
*  the Pacific, everybody's always talking about AUKUS. It's AUKUS, AUKUS Pillar 2, technology sharing. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1168.2800000000002s)]
*  But because the timelines on a lot of that are long, if you're thinking about the requisites of [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1174.5200000000002s)]
*  deterrence, actually, in a lot of ways, it's the force posture initiative that'll have the greater [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1179.64s)]
*  impact in the short to medium term on the deterrence challenges. And it doesn't get enough [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1184.76s)]
*  attention, which is why I'm glad you did the chapter. So what you argue, of course, is that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1190.76s)]
*  you're very careful. You said that the debate in Australia has moved to a place where people are [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1197.48s)]
*  less reluctant to think about American forces operating from Australia. But less reluctant is [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1202.68s)]
*  somewhat careful. And then you have a lot prescriptive to say about where we go from here. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  So I want to give you a chance to dig in on that a little bit. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1213.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, thank you. And thanks for having me. And I think that, I mean, if you look at [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1216.52s)]
*  alliances in the way that they cooperate, there's a lot of history, political identity, strategic, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1221.8s)]
*  and strategic circumstances that lead different alliances to have very different, if you like, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1228.76s)]
*  political, military, strategic models of what actually is the logic of that integration. And [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1234.76s)]
*  NATO, obviously, very integrated alliance. If you look at Korea, traditionally, fairly hierarchical [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1239.4s)]
*  alliance. Japan, functional division of labor, that short-sword shield arrangement. And in the [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1245.72s)]
*  Australia-US alliance, we have none of that. Essentially, the model for how the alliance [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1252.68s)]
*  operates at that level has traditionally been geographic separation. Australia looks after our [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1258.92s)]
*  patch. The US looks after the rest of the world. And I think that that has very deep roots in [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1264.36s)]
*  Australia's thinking. I think also very deep roots in American thinking in the sense that America [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1270.12s)]
*  hasn't paid a lot of attention to what's happening in Australia's immediate region. And I think that [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1274.84s)]
*  that's where a lot of the progress that we've seen over the last few years in US posture [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1281.0s)]
*  initiatives in Australia, as I lay out in the chapter, are more attributable to political [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1287.0s)]
*  circumstances being a bit more amenable to the Australians not immediately saying no, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1292.76s)]
*  than to a shared concept that actually explains the logic of how Australia's and US efforts in [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1298.76s)]
*  this alliance and in this region in particular actually articulate. And I think that, I mean, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1305.8799999999999s)]
*  if you look at the current Australian national defense strategy, you'll see kind of greater [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1311.16s)]
*  emphasis on deterrence. But that is completely framed in a very local view of deterrence by [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1314.92s)]
*  denial in our own approaches. It doesn't articulate into a broader concept of multilateral [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1321.72s)]
*  deterrence. It doesn't, on the face of it, it may lay out, it may seem like a short [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1326.92s)]
*  sword shield model in the sense that Australia focuses on the defense of Australia so that the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1334.6000000000001s)]
*  US can use Australia for longer range operations. But that's not how it is articulated. And I don't [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1340.68s)]
*  think that that's how it is conceived. And it does mean that a lot of the practical touch points of [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1347.16s)]
*  how these two postures might actually overlap and relate to each other don't receive a lot of [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1352.52s)]
*  attention. And there's certainly no policy guidance in the Australian case on those. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1359.5600000000002s)]
*  So I think that when you go forward, we need to think about the, when we think about what [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1364.0400000000002s)]
*  does success look like in US Australia force posture activity, we shouldn't look to just to [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1368.68s)]
*  the extent to which American presence in Australia is ramping up. But in many ways, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1375.24s)]
*  we need to look at to what extent do we achieve a more closer alignment of national postures [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1380.6s)]
*  in our own region and a closer, more explicit articulation of how American and Australian efforts [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1386.68s)]
*  in Australia's own region relate to each other. And I think related to that is we need to think [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1394.04s)]
*  more about managing about horizontal escalation as an element of deterrence in the Alliance [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1401.72s)]
*  rather than vertical escalation in terms of wrapping up American long range strikes [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1407.4s)]
*  from here. And that means to make both horizontal escalation in terms of leveraging our alliance [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1411.88s)]
*  cooperation to bring in additional countries into a broader coalition. But also, and I think the [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1416.76s)]
*  Chinese sector deployment is a good example here, how do we manage potential Chinese horizontal [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1422.68s)]
*  escalation into our region? And I think that as I lay out in the chapter, that leads you to [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1427.24s)]
*  certain practical questions that I think are worthwhile while looking at. For example, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1434.2s)]
*  Australia is now paying a lot more attention to how do we operate in particular with our army in [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1439.48s)]
*  the islands to our north. And this concept of littoral operations, pushing our army into the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1445.0s)]
*  islands. But in many ways, the strategic relevance of those islands is largely because they sit [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1449.72s)]
*  alongside the key US logistics routes that you would have to use to resupply or to supply [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1455.1599999999999s)]
*  large American deployments to Australia. And so I think that there is, again, a very practical [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1462.04s)]
*  element that our army who would have to operate in those regions, if one of their main tasks is [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1467.08s)]
*  local force protection for American convoys, there are a lot of practical questions that are just not [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1473.56s)]
*  on people's radar that also go to the question as to at what point might you deploy in a crisis? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1479.56s)]
*  And broader issues like that. It also means that we need to think about how do New Zealand and [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1485.72s)]
*  France fit into that broader challenge. There's issues about the security of Australia's [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1490.52s)]
*  rear bases. There's parallels there, I think, with thinking about cruise missile defense of [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1499.3999999999999s)]
*  the North American continent, cruise missile defense of Australia's southeast and southwest, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1504.6s)]
*  and the SAC deployment, I think, was a very useful wake up call there. But it's also shown that [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1509.32s)]
*  if you look at the cooperation between the New Zealand Navy and the Australian Navy and the [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1515.08s)]
*  reported delays of 40 minutes by the time that Australia found out from the New Zealand vessel [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1520.6s)]
*  reportedly that the live fire exercises have started, that there are some serious questions [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1526.28s)]
*  there about C2 arrangements in the Australian New Zealand context about how we would actually [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1531.3999999999999s)]
*  handle that in a crisis that I think we need to address, where obviously the US has stakes and [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1536.84s)]
*  also a need to be involved in. There are other, I mean, going more broadly to that question of how [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1542.92s)]
*  do we leverage alliance cooperation to bring in additional countries. I mean, at least until [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1550.3600000000001s)]
*  recently, European countries have been on a very steep curve to increase their kind of presence in [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1556.3600000000001s)]
*  the Indo-Pacific for signaling. And I mean, a lot of that also involves Australia. I think that, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1563.0800000000002s)]
*  as Europeans, the defense industry is ramping up, they will play an increasingly important role, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1570.3600000000001s)]
*  including for deterrence and certainly if we're looking at a long conflict. And so I think there [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1576.2800000000002s)]
*  is a shared interest in fostering and enabling European countries to signal their interest in [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1579.96s)]
*  what's happening in a major conflict in the Indo-Pacific. And I think Australia has a key [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1587.4s)]
*  role to play there as a partner that can bring Europeans along and also for practical reasons. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1593.96s)]
*  So I think, I mean, one of the points that I put out in my chapter is, I mean, thinking about [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1600.52s)]
*  developing a tanker bridge between Europe and Australia as one of the upcoming [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1605.4s)]
*  exercises could be a way of leveraging existing cooperation into ways that is operationally [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1612.3600000000001s)]
*  relevant, but that also has brought a political strategic significance of moving European thinking [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1618.04s)]
*  into from peacetime deployments into what might be their role and interest be in a crisis. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1624.3600000000001s)]
*  And so I think that, again, thinking more about the practical implications of how does an American [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1632.8400000000001s)]
*  posture that's ramping up in our own region articulate with the actual role that Australian [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1639.48s)]
*  forces will play and in a way that kind of aligns with the very deep historical and political [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1645.8s)]
*  identity like aspects that underpin Australia's thinking about our own defence role and this [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1652.6s)]
*  concept of self-reliance, I think is increasingly important. So I hope that the chapter can put out [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1658.44s)]
*  some of those ideas there that may still have some practical relevance. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1665.0s)]
*  You're muted. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1674.28s)]
*  I was going to say you set up Stacey's paper perfectly. So Courtney, I know I said I was [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1676.92s)]
*  going to go to you next, but with your indulgence, I'm going to go to Stacey because you just teased [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1680.84s)]
*  this idea of divvying up Alliance roles and missions and finding the right division of labour. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1684.76s)]
*  So, Stacey, what's interesting about your chapter is that you don't look at that just in the abstract [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1689.32s)]
*  and how you get the inputs now necessary to think about scenario planning and operations for later, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1694.76s)]
*  but you actually pull the thread on some scenarios. So there's the big Taiwan scenario, there's the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1700.76s)]
*  second Thomas Scholes scenario, and then there's a Coral Sea scenario. And on that, then you work [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1705.32s)]
*  backwards to think a little bit about the kinds of modular inputs that are needed. So I'm going to [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1710.6799999999998s)]
*  give you a chance to pull those threads a little bit with an eye to this idea that we're going to [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1715.48s)]
*  face this issue of a division of labour within the Alliance, and we need to optimise for that. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1721.56s)]
*  Yeah, excuse me. Thanks, Evan. So my paper was really born out of the last administration in [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1727.8s)]
*  the United States defence strategy, which was integrated deterrence. And Becca Wasser and I had [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1735.0s)]
*  a CNAS report, an OIN team that advocated for thinking about integration more holistically. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1740.36s)]
*  So we always consider or sort of equate frequently in the defence realm integration with [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1747.72s)]
*  interoperability. But that's a really tactical thing. We argued you needed to move up and think [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1753.48s)]
*  about institutional integration, which includes things like the defence industrial base and [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1759.16s)]
*  different planning processes, and then strategic integration. And strategic integration in the way [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1764.36s)]
*  that we argued did not equate with perfect alignment of interests, because we know that [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1770.36s)]
*  does not exist. But it was deemed to be necessary to more effectively guide our other forms of [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1775.9599999999998s)]
*  military cooperation and activities so that they could best meet our shared interests. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1785.24s)]
*  So that meant sort of revealing the areas of convergence and divergence in our strategy [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1790.6s)]
*  and what we really thought about doing in a concrete way. So like you said, I laid out three [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1796.36s)]
*  different scenarios that were dramatically different in terms of the scale of the conflict, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1802.1999999999998s)]
*  the type, the location and the US and Australian interests. And I did so largely because I felt like [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1806.9199999999998s)]
*  you were saying all of this activity that was really positive in the US-Australian [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1813.56s)]
*  alliance relationship in terms of posture activities that I'd been working on since 2011 [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1818.6s)]
*  when I was at Rand and looking at the Northern bases and making improvements there to AUKUS. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1824.36s)]
*  But there wasn't any sort of real coherence to it, and that oftentimes the two allies were actually [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1831.6399999999999s)]
*  speaking past each other. And that even common terms like deterrence by denial elided differences [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1838.12s)]
*  in terms of what we meant and what each party sort of expected of each other. I run a lot of war [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1844.76s)]
*  games, and I cannot tell you the number of times that I've had American players, often officials [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1851.8799999999999s)]
*  within the Department of Defense, who make really pretty outlandish assumptions about access [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1859.0s)]
*  requirements or what allies will send or deploy in different scenarios and don't really have a good [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1865.24s)]
*  understanding of the interests of that allied nation or the constraints, the political constraints, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1872.04s)]
*  and think that through in a really careful way. So with the report, what I tried to do was [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1880.28s)]
*  identify three scenarios that varied in terms of who really cared about them. Australia, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1888.8400000000001s)]
*  the most important and existential threat, not in an existential nuclear way, but the most direct [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1894.92s)]
*  threat to the Australian homeland is some sort of future Chinese coercion in the Coral Sea. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1900.76s)]
*  And this was my attempt to get at what I think the new Australian defense strategy is hinting at in [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1906.44s)]
*  terms of defending the Northern approaches. And it's really not a conflict over a piece of [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1912.6s)]
*  territory. It's a lot more amorphous where there are concerns that the Chinese military and in [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1917.72s)]
*  particular the Navy and the Air Force is going to begin operating more in those Northern areas [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1923.24s)]
*  and might be engaging in harassment of Australian military aircraft, maybe harassing other fishing [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1929.6399999999999s)]
*  and engaging in their own illegal fishing and things like that. The second Thomas [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1938.44s)]
*  Shoal was just kind of an in-between in which neither party actually had deep, super deep [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1943.32s)]
*  interest in getting directly involved. And then Taiwan's obviously been the focus of the Department [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1949.96s)]
*  of Defense since at least probably 2018. Eli Ratner called it the pacing scenario for the [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1954.76s)]
*  department, which really meant it's what the department is using to develop its force design [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1961.8s)]
*  and force structure and measuring itself against. And I think that both Canberra and Washington [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1968.52s)]
*  need to have these honest conversations where they think specifically like, no, I don't want [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1974.36s)]
*  to send forces forward into Japan or the Philippines early in a crisis as a show of force [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1979.6399999999999s)]
*  because I need them at home in Australia to defend our own airspace. And that actually is beneficial [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1986.9199999999998s)]
*  from an Alliance perspective as well. But having that context that is really specific is necessary [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=1993.8s)]
*  for these conversations. And I don't expect either party would ever pre-commit to different things, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2002.12s)]
*  but sort of understand where the boundaries are, what are the outer bounds of what's within the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2007.72s)]
*  realm of possible. And it can therefore on their own and collectively develop more realistic plans, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2012.92s)]
*  which should strengthen deterrence and filter down to other activities. You build up the bases that [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2020.44s)]
*  are potentially useful for the ADF to use to defend the northern approaches, and then think [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2028.6799999999998s)]
*  about whether you're going to actually have American bombers operating there or not. And if [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2038.84s)]
*  you don't, it's a very different requirement in terms of the infrastructure that needs to be built. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2043.0s)]
*  And you think through things like AUKUS, if Australia has an American Virginia-class submarine [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2048.52s)]
*  in about four or five years, that that isn't necessarily going to deploy forward if there [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2054.68s)]
*  were a war over Taiwan, that it might be better used defending, patrolling the northern waters [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2060.7599999999998s)]
*  and the Indian Ocean and making sure that the PLA and remains bottled up and that Australia is [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2067.4s)]
*  defended. So my big push was to be specific and to have really uncomfortable conversations, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2076.2s)]
*  not because you're going to actually reach some sort of consensus, but because you can improve [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2083.32s)]
*  your understanding of what the other is thinking and then iterate and revise your own plans so [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2088.6000000000004s)]
*  that they serve your own country's interests and figure out collectively what it makes the most [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2096.76s)]
*  sense for you to make investments in and posture in defense industrial-based investments like [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2101.4s)]
*  GUIO, the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Initiative that Australia is undertaking and [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2108.6s)]
*  they're going to be building gimlers, which probably isn't useful for any of the scenarios [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2114.2799999999997s)]
*  that I just discussed. It just helps you to sort of more coherently rationalize all of your [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2118.9199999999996s)]
*  defense activities and understand whether they support collective goals and shared goals or [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2127.16s)]
*  separate ones and what you really want to make your, where you want to make your investments. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2135.16s)]
*  Can I, before I go to Courtney, this issue about, part of our objective with this project was to get [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2141.7999999999997s)]
*  Americans to think harder about this alliance and your point about assumptions that are baked into [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2148.12s)]
*  a lot of the conversations in Washington not reflecting either Australian realities, it [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2155.64s)]
*  actually comes out in a few chapters starting with Matt and Peter's, but actually it threads [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2161.48s)]
*  through all of them, but also the way you put it was not having the kinds of conversations that need [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2166.52s)]
*  to be had. What do you think is the biggest obstacle to that right now as you look, I mean [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2171.64s)]
*  we have a new administration that just took office. What assumption is the biggest howler right now [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2178.04s)]
*  that you see on the DC side? Well, I mean it's not clear to me that the Trump administration is really [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2185.16s)]
*  interested in looking at areas of collective gain as much as American gain and what's in it for them [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2190.28s)]
*  despite having a focus on China, but I think the other factor that really inhibits this is that [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2196.76s)]
*  Australia is in some ways, and I don't mean this at all pejoratively, in an early stage of thinking [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2203.2400000000002s)]
*  about its own defense in a really concrete modern, against modern threats, that they haven't had to [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2210.92s)]
*  worry about threats to the Australian homeland for quite some time, and now suddenly they're [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2217.96s)]
*  sort of beginning to engage in a planning process that is a lot more deliberate and worried about [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2224.52s)]
*  defending their homeland in a way that I think has meant that we were always talking about [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2233.88s)]
*  operating somewhere else, you know expeditionary operations in the Middle East that were of [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2240.52s)]
*  peripheral interests where you didn't have the pressure and the urgency to have that pre-planning. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2244.92s)]
*  You could you know make things up as you went along and just sort of have a pickup game, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2250.52s)]
*  and until Australia sort of becomes comfortable with what their strategy really means to them, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2255.96s)]
*  and the Australian public accepts that, you know I don't think I'm trying to remember because it's [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2262.44s)]
*  been a bit of time, but I don't think the strategy directly names China as the what they're trying to [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2267.2400000000002s)]
*  or specifies what that is. They need to sort of develop and mature that conversation within [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2273.08s)]
*  their own nation before they can bring it to the table with the US. All right Courtney, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2279.6400000000003s)]
*  your paper is provocative, and it's generated a lot of interest because it's really it gets at [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2287.4s)]
*  this issue of third, fourth, fifth partners, but in the context of thinking about collective detours, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2293.08s)]
*  and specifically in your paper in the context of a combined force with other partners. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2298.28s)]
*  Talk a little bit, I'm just going to throw that right to you and just let you talk. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2306.04s)]
*  Right, excuse me. Before I completely jump into it, because it was meant to be provocative, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2309.56s)]
*  and I spent you know I spent a lot of time thinking very deeply about [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2318.36s)]
*  effective deterrence and what that actually meant in the region and what it meant for Australia, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2323.4s)]
*  and for all the reasons Stacey and all the others have actually outlined, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2326.92s)]
*  you know Australia needs to be brought along on the deterrence journey. It's still, I would [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2332.84s)]
*  personally say in its infancy, in its deterrence thinking, but it needs allies like America, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2340.36s)]
*  if it is to deter, and it needs America to deter anyways. There's not a lot it's going to be able [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2348.44s)]
*  to deter independently, and so from a conceptual point of view, a sophisticated deterrence [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2353.4s)]
*  thinking, as well as the capability, it needs an ally like America and a partner like Japan as well [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2363.88s)]
*  to kind of bring it up. But I think before I get, like I said before too much, I think [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2371.96s)]
*  right now is actually, I'm quite optimistic about this administration and what's possible [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2376.68s)]
*  in this region for deterrence. If you look at Bridge Colby's nomination hearing, which I think [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2383.0s)]
*  was just a few days ago in the US, he's the author of the 2018 US National Defense Strategy, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2390.7599999999998s)]
*  and in that he makes a really big, but he was the, I should say the author of the 2018 US [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2398.2799999999997s)]
*  National Defense Strategy. He's coming back right now, we're just waiting for the confirmation [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2404.68s)]
*  hearing, I think result, but he'll be the number three in the Pentagon. He'll be the Undersecretary [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2408.44s)]
*  of Defense for Policy. So if you look at his 2018 National Defense Strategy, if you look at [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2413.56s)]
*  the 2021 book, Strategy of Denial, if you look at his written remarks from the committee hearing, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2421.0s)]
*  he, I think we should see the Pentagon will lean in quite a lot asking allies, just like NATO, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2428.84s)]
*  spend more and do more. And that means not just get more capabilities, but take on a more leadership [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2437.24s)]
*  role. But for Australia, what does that mean? It can, sure, it can raise the 2.1 or 2.2 to 2.4% [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2443.56s)]
*  of GDP for defense, but what are we buying? What are we going to get for our money? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2453.16s)]
*  And I think until we have some sort of combined coordination mechanism, some sort of institutionalized [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2459.56s)]
*  mechanism to discuss and to actually operationalize deterrence, it's always going to be completely [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2469.56s)]
*  ineffective, from my perspective. It's always going to be, it's not going to be effective, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2475.72s)]
*  it's not going to deter China, because it's not going to have the time, the readiness, it's not [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2481.48s)]
*  going to have the coordination amongst the political elites. The interoperability is not going [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2487.8s)]
*  to be there between the human factor, the procedural factors, the technical factors. We're always going [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2493.64s)]
*  to be behind. That's not credible. That's not effective, in my point of view. And so if you [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2499.48s)]
*  were able to create some sort of mechanism, and people have said, oh, we need an Asia, an Asian [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2507.24s)]
*  NATO, I think that's never going to happen. But I think if you created a combined joint force, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2512.9199999999996s)]
*  that that would be the sort of the workaround that people could have the appetite to consider. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2519.64s)]
*  That wouldn't be a brand new force. That would be forces that could be training together, that could [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2526.12s)]
*  be planning together, that could be working towards interoperability together, a place to [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2531.96s)]
*  actually have these hard conversations that Stacey's mentioning, and get on the same page, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2539.0s)]
*  and be really clear about who's willing to show up for what, and then actually form those task [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2543.8s)]
*  groups. You could have them on MISO, you could have them on deterring threats to critical [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2549.0s)]
*  infrastructure, you could have them on whatever the issues are that mattered to the countries in [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2556.2s)]
*  this region. I could be talking about this for a lot longer, but the idea is to create a brand new [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2562.2799999999997s)]
*  mechanism, a joint combined deterrence force, headquartered out of Indo-Pacom. And yeah, that [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2570.2799999999997s)]
*  was kind of my big idea. Could I just ask Peter or the others, because you've read Courtney's [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2580.04s)]
*  chapter, I'm just curious what the appetite is in Australia to think through that. I'm thinking [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2586.7599999999998s)]
*  about this probably because we published this alliance review in 2024. Some of you may not [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2592.52s)]
*  remember this. I worked on one in 1999 at the Kennedy School that was co-chaired by Paul Dib [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2597.88s)]
*  and Bob Blackwell. And one of the recommendations that came out of that volume was more coordinated [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2603.72s)]
*  U.S. The U.S. had these bilateral alliances in the region, five alliances. And so the recommendation [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2608.84s)]
*  from most of that task force was for more coordinated alliances. And to anybody who remembers [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2614.6800000000003s)]
*  that volume, there was a furious reaction from at least one and maybe a couple of folks on the [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2619.32s)]
*  Australian side saying, this is the worst idea we've ever heard ever. And so the Australian debate [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2624.28s)]
*  has now moved quite a bit over 25 years. But when I pull it up to what Courtney's talking about, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2629.0s)]
*  which is kind of expeditionary combined forces for deterrence and then potentially for operations, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2635.08s)]
*  I'm just curious how far, what's the state of the appetite in Australia in your judgment? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2641.64s)]
*  I'm happy to jump in there. And I mean, I think Courtney is right. I mean, we need to build more [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2650.6s)]
*  integrated forces that allow us to, in particular, I would say for signaling. I mean, I think [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2656.04s)]
*  we there's a great need for us, I think, to be able to operate, for example, in the South China Sea [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2663.4s)]
*  in support of the Philippines, wherever China may be pressing at one point, and we may actually want [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2670.04s)]
*  to send signals through the deployment of military force. These parallel, loosely coordinated national [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2675.96s)]
*  signaling efforts that we have in our region at the moment just don't cut the mustard, I think, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2683.72s)]
*  in particular, if crises escalate. But that's a very different thing from saying that that kind [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2689.32s)]
*  of like joint force that you might use for signaling actually then has operational warfighting [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2695.2400000000002s)]
*  value. Because I think if the, and this connects with what Stacey is saying, Australia, I think, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2700.2000000000003s)]
*  has had, was very naive about what we can achieve in a major conflict. And I think that that is [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2706.44s)]
*  still a bit there. I mean, we're 25 million people on a continent the size of the continental US. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2711.48s)]
*  All of which coasts are ultimately vulnerable now. So the ability for us to deploy forces even into [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2718.52s)]
*  Australia's north, which I think is a very great focus of the national defense strategy, there's a [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2726.6s)]
*  lot of things that we need to do to defend our rear areas before we can think of pushing forces [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2731.1600000000003s)]
*  north. And I think that that's kind of like where more greater integration is necessary. And I think [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2736.52s)]
*  if you look at C2, and how do we actually keep the sea lines free? I mean, we need to think back to [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2743.48s)]
*  the last time we dealt with this is the Second World War. I mean, it's the First World War and [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2750.44s)]
*  the Second World War, the first few months, the main thing that the Australian Navy did is clear [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2755.16s)]
*  the seas in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific of German raiders. And that's exactly the same thing [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2760.68s)]
*  that we're going to have to do again before we can think about sending anybody anywhere. That's very [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2765.08s)]
*  kind of not very glamorous, but it needs to be done and it needs to be prepared for. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2770.44s)]
*  And I think that again, those kinds of issues are things that putting those things on the table for [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2776.12s)]
*  Australia would actually help advance our debate and focus minds. And I think that whether that's a [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2781.8s)]
*  joint command structure, you probably wouldn't have to do that with joint forces, but it needs [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2788.68s)]
*  more attention to those very unglamorous practical issues. And I mean, going back to the Second [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2792.68s)]
*  World War, I mean, we've had, you know, Chinese and Japanese submarine and air attacks on our [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2798.84s)]
*  air surveillance of Sydney. I mean, people, Australia doesn't really like to think too much [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2805.56s)]
*  that, you know, a lot of part of our Navy or JSF are going to fly caps over Sydney and other places [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2812.04s)]
*  like that. But that's going to be the reality that we need to kind of accept and work around. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2817.08s)]
*  Evin, can I jump in? I'm sorry. I know not offering an Australian perspective to suddenly [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2822.28s)]
*  an American one here. I do think that this could be very helpful from a deterrent signaling [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2830.2000000000003s)]
*  perspective, but you're already seeing bits and pieces of this, like with AUKUS, with the submarines, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2834.36s)]
*  Australians are going to be on American Virginia class submarines as they're learning how to operate [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2839.2400000000002s)]
*  and maintain the boats. And, you know, there've been questions raised about what happens if a [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2844.6000000000004s)]
*  balloon goes up and that submarine is deployed to go into the Taiwan Strait and sink ships. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2849.8s)]
*  I'm afraid that sometimes the type of operational integration that Courtney is talking about [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2855.32s)]
*  doesn't mean that you actually have the harder strategic and policy conversations at the higher [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2863.0800000000004s)]
*  level. I've been in a lot of war games with different allies and partners, often normally [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2869.7200000000003s)]
*  in separate rooms and where what the Americans will say, even to those where we have combined [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2874.84s)]
*  headquarters, is very, very different. And sometimes just creating the operational force, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2879.6400000000003s)]
*  it does signal something, but it doesn't mean you've actually figured out what you want to do [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2887.0s)]
*  with it or what you won't do with it. And it can create the appearance of more alignment than there [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2890.84s)]
*  is, which might be, you know, that could be the whole point of deterrence, but I don't think it [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2898.92s)]
*  necessarily will result in strengthening it either. Just very quickly, if I can, on [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2903.48s)]
*  heart conversations, I think that, you know, if you are going to do a sort of fully integrated [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2912.68s)]
*  combined force like this, there are some roadblocks in the Australian context in terms of how [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2918.52s)]
*  Australians think about future war and future contingencies versus how the United States thinks [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2924.52s)]
*  about future contingencies. I've put very, very crudely, and this is by no means comprehensive, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2929.64s)]
*  but it does seem that the predominant American view of future war will be high tempo, high [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2939.0s)]
*  intensity, fought on the high seas. Whereas from Australian context, future war is thought of much [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2946.04s)]
*  more as something that might be sub threshold, something that might grow through things like, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2952.12s)]
*  you know, civil military fusion fleets or, you know, harassment within the region in a literal [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2960.12s)]
*  context, green water and so green water and so forth. So now there is those different [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2966.2799999999997s)]
*  emphases, I think, on what future battles will look like. And perhaps, in fact, part of that [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2972.92s)]
*  conversation between Australia and the United States will focus and need to focus very much on [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2979.24s)]
*  those capabilities that Australia has and where can we be a better ally to the United States in [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2984.6s)]
*  an actual operational context. Given the way that we are postured with, you know, or the sub still [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2991.4799999999996s)]
*  way off, maybe it makes sense for Australia to focus on that sort of, you know, sort of more low end [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=2997.8799999999997s)]
*  aspect of things and designate combined forces for or build up combined forces for that purpose. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3005.2400000000002s)]
*  But, you know, without that kind of discussion about where those basic strategic understandings [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3013.96s)]
*  are, I think you are perhaps left with something that's only valuable for messaging rather than [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3019.96s)]
*  something that can be used. Peter, did you want to jump in on this? I have a couple of audience [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3025.0s)]
*  questions. I want to give you a chance. Evan, thanks very briefly and mindful that I hope you [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3030.6s)]
*  can hear me. But there's been a few sound interruptions. So I've got the gist, but I'll [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3037.72s)]
*  just make a couple of brief observations. First, I think there would be a political neuralgia about [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3042.8399999999997s)]
*  committing any institutional way to a Jeff type model because of the perception that that would [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3047.64s)]
*  bind us irrevocably and the costs of potentially saying actually maybe we're going to sit this one [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3053.08s)]
*  out would be very, very high. The second is a question of scale. We have 58,000 people in [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3057.56s)]
*  uniform and we have 27 million people, half of them live in three East Coast capital cities. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3063.64s)]
*  There are practical constraints on our industrial base and that's why I think the [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3069.7999999999997s)]
*  ideas in Jennifer's piece are particularly pertinent and Matt and others have talked about [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3073.72s)]
*  AUKUS. We've got building blocks there, but what we need to do is lean much more heavily into this [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3078.44s)]
*  because the obsessive focus in Australia on nuclear powered submarines means that as with [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3083.72s)]
*  the tank, everyone has an opinion and the opinion is not always well formed. AUKUS Pillar 2, I think, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3089.8799999999997s)]
*  is really exemplary in how we can help ourselves jointly, collectively and in a much more integrated [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3096.3599999999997s)]
*  way to create the resilience and the depth which will have deterrent effect, will be an important [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3102.4399999999996s)]
*  contribution to signalling and we should be a lot more, I think, innovative and flexible in how and [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3110.28s)]
*  where we work with partners in the region to operationalise these effects and there are some [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3116.1200000000003s)]
*  players who are going to be much more forward leaning. There will be others who will be supportive [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3122.0400000000004s)]
*  in a quiet way. We've got a lot of experience there and I think rather than always looking [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3126.36s)]
*  for the next new big thing, institutionally speaking, we should really concentrate on [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3131.6400000000003s)]
*  deepening the foundations of what we have and I think the Joint Defence Industrial Base is [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3137.64s)]
*  absolutely fundamental because it also gets to that question of defending the rear that Stefan [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3143.3199999999997s)]
*  was talking about as we see more and more US assets dispersed across the region and in particular into [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3148.12s)]
*  Australia. A couple of comments over to you. To do a combined force, you'd need to have the right [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3154.68s)]
*  package of relationships with third and fourth parties and so I want you guys, maybe Courtney, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3160.68s)]
*  to go back to you and just let you all pull that thread a little bit. There's a question here from [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3165.88s)]
*  the audience. It's framed in terms of what's going on. There's a lot of rumour-mongering now about [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3170.6s)]
*  Five Eyes and Canada, stuff in the media but the question is really about how to better develop [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3175.08s)]
*  that set of partnerships with third and fourth parties. Japan springs to mind in particular but [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3181.96s)]
*  not just Japan. Peter teased Indonesia. There's kind of India out in the background as a growing [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3187.6400000000003s)]
*  maritime player. Courtney, I want to go back to you so you can respond to anything but also [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3192.44s)]
*  anybody that wants to jump in on this question of how you assess the state of those third, fourth, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3199.96s)]
*  fifth, sixth party offshore relationships, whether in the defence domain or in the logistics or [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3204.04s)]
*  intelligence domain and then what's not being done that needs to be done. I want to give you all a [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3210.6s)]
*  chance to jump in. Courtney, why don't I start with you? Thanks, Evan. Just to get to Peter's [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3215.16s)]
*  point about not creating anything new, I would say the train has already left the station and [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3221.56s)]
*  if you look at how I set up my paper, I went into detail about what the US and Australia are already [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3229.24s)]
*  doing in this space and what Australia is doing with Japan in this space and what the US is doing [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3235.48s)]
*  with Japan in this space and then what all three are doing in this space. The skids are already [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3241.64s)]
*  greased in this regard from what I'm already seeing. The work's already happening. We're [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3248.44s)]
*  looking at getting Japanese rotational forces at Darwin. These things are already happening. In [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3254.44s)]
*  terms of other third and fourth parties, what I love about the idea of, let's say, the GEPH [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3259.56s)]
*  or the CMF is that this is a build-your-own-adventure on what matters in this region. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3267.64s)]
*  I think there's alignment already about what we see as common. We want to deter threats to our [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3274.7599999999998s)]
*  sovereignty, threats to territorial integrity, to our critical infrastructure, to our supply lines, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3280.8399999999997s)]
*  to threats for our prosperity. How do we do that? You can create task force that matter to us. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3287.7999999999997s)]
*  They don't have to be a joint expeditionary force. It doesn't have to be that. That might be 10 years [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3295.24s)]
*  from now. That might be five years from now. There can be smaller ones where people can start [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3300.2s)]
*  to work together to start to iron out these challenges operationally now. The beauty of [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3305.24s)]
*  this model would be that countries like Fiji or New Zealand or Malaysia, they can add what they'd [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3311.08s)]
*  like, when they'd like, to these structures. It's not NATO. You're not signing your forces over [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3318.9199999999996s)]
*  to a larger body. It doesn't work that way. We haven't talked about Trump much, but I do think [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3329.0s)]
*  I think Courtney is right. In many ways, what we see coming out of the administration in terms of [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3341.56s)]
*  the management of Indo-Pacific alliances may strengthen a lot of the points that we've [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3349.0s)]
*  talked about here. I do think something has fundamentally changed, and that will play out [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3352.76s)]
*  over the next few years. That's the way that we look at dependence on the US. We've had for years [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3357.64s)]
*  debates about to what extent can we depend on the US, but largely that was framed around the question, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3363.56s)]
*  will the US ever lose interest and questions about burden sharing between the allies. In many ways, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3369.8799999999997s)]
*  what we would need to do to strengthen the alliance or what we would need to do in practice to [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3376.12s)]
*  kind of prepare for a possible loss of American interest was essentially the same, which is [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3381.0s)]
*  spending more and build up self-reliance in forces, but ultimately based on access to the [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3385.96s)]
*  American industrial base. I think that whatever is going to happen in terms of the engagement of US [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3392.12s)]
*  allies in the Indo-Pacific, now when we have those conversations, we can't ignore the question anymore [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3398.84s)]
*  if we are faced not with a US that is looking for more burden sharing or loss of interest, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3406.04s)]
*  but a US that is actually actively hostile to its allies. I think that what's going on with Canada, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3411.08s)]
*  what's going on with Ukraine, it's as fanciful as it might seem, those questions will now come up, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3417.72s)]
*  and that will have consequences, I think, for the way that we look at reassess the risks [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3428.04s)]
*  of integrating even in the defense industrial base. How much of that will actually have practical [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3433.08s)]
*  consequences remains to be seen, and I think that that will play out over the next few years. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3438.44s)]
*  But I do think that we need to be aware that the political and policy debates, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3443.7200000000003s)]
*  we can't ignore that question of not just dealing with, in the worst case, being an [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3449.08s)]
*  America that looks to allies carry more of the burden and gracefully bows out, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3454.52s)]
*  but an America that may actually be actively hostile. I think that sounds fanciful in our [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3459.96s)]
*  region, but I think the politics there and the realities have changed, and that will have impacts [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3466.52s)]
*  for the way that Australia reassesses a lot of these risks and benefits of future alliance cooperation. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3472.44s)]
*  I'm glad you said in our region, because that European conversation doesn't seem to have come [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3478.6s)]
*  in the... hasn't migrated west yet, and in fact... [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3483.08s)]
*  It doesn't mean that... I mean, before two months ago, we wouldn't have had, you know, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3487.56s)]
*  if you raised those issues, it wouldn't have had much traction. It's not as easy to dismiss now anymore. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3493.88s)]
*  No, sure. But I mean, P. Dex's first meeting, I think, with a foreign minister was with Richard [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3502.2000000000003s)]
*  Moss, if I'm not mistaken. So, you know, a lot of the right things were said, and at least the optics [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3507.1600000000003s)]
*  of it are a little different, at least at this point than they are in Europe. Peter, I think [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3512.44s)]
*  we're going to lose you. I'm going to run five minutes over with the others, but if we are going [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3517.56s)]
*  to lose you, I want to thank you for joining us, and look forward to encores with you. We're going [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3521.64s)]
*  to launch this thing in Australia in a few weeks. So thanks, Peter. I just wanted to pull the thread [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3526.7599999999998s)]
*  with just five minutes. There's one more audience question, so I want to be respectful of the [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3532.52s)]
*  audience, and then I want to do just one quick round robin, where you each kind of give your, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3536.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, top piece of advice, particularly to the Trump team. You know, if you were them, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3541.48s)]
*  how would you be, how would you recommend they be thinking about Australia? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3548.2799999999997s)]
*  Because they may not be yet preoccupied as they are. But Stacy, there's a question from Lachlan [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3551.7999999999997s)]
*  McGovern just about Chinese coercion in the South China Sea and in the Coral Sea specifically, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3556.4399999999996s)]
*  because those are your scenarios. So he just asked, how do we, how do we raise the costs [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3564.2s)]
*  to change the Chinese calculus? And I think what's implicit in that question is jointly. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3569.72s)]
*  I mean, that's a hard question. You have to be willing to run the risks if you're going to raise [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3574.52s)]
*  the costs jointly. And the argument that I made in the paper and that I think I stand by is that [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3581.32s)]
*  the country that is best positioned to respond to Chinese coercion is the one that is proximate to [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3587.96s)]
*  it, and that has the greatest interest. So that would be the Philippines for the South China Sea, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3595.72s)]
*  and then Australia in the Coral Sea. And that doesn't mean that other partners and allies might [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3601.24s)]
*  not backstop you. But I think the persistent nature of the gray zone type of coercion that [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3607.56s)]
*  China engages in means that you really need to have a more continuous presence. And that doesn't [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3615.08s)]
*  really lend itself to being a combined operation. And if you're going to undertake that, you have [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3620.36s)]
*  to be willing to undertake the risks associated with it. Like if the US were to start resupplying [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3626.52s)]
*  the Sierra Madre or actually stationing forces on it, which some people have advocated for. That [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3631.4s)]
*  being said, there are lots of things that already happen. My understanding is the US Marines and [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3638.2s)]
*  Darwin, sometimes Transit to the east to Queensland to go do some exercises on Australian amphibious [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3643.32s)]
*  ships. And I wouldn't stop those type of activities. You might want to have them more often, but I [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3650.7599999999998s)]
*  don't think that's your primary way of responding to it, because you need to have a more frequent [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3656.28s)]
*  response, and that's going to rely on the forces that are closest. Okay. Can I just, just to close [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3662.76s)]
*  this out, can I just do that quick round robin? I mean, you're free. I mean, it's an election here [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3669.8s)]
*  in Australia too. So you're free to give a recommendation to the Australian side about [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3673.7200000000003s)]
*  either how they need to think this through, given the new dispensation over here. But I'm particularly [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3678.1200000000003s)]
*  thinking about the American side, because that was part of our objective was to deepen the thinking [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3683.16s)]
*  about this particular bilateral alliance on this side of the Pacific. Just give, you know, no less [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3688.8399999999997s)]
*  than one, but maybe no more than two recommendations as we, you know, as the people come into place. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3696.52s)]
*  We're going to think a little bit harder about what are we not doing that we need to be doing? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3703.96s)]
*  If you were writing the post-Marls Hegseth memo, Courtney, Stacy, what's the priority action item? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3708.52s)]
*  Courtney, why don't I start with you? I just keep thinking about expectations. I'd also, you know, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3718.12s)]
*  I'd love to hear what the expectations are from a U.S. perspective. What, you know, what role do [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3726.36s)]
*  they expect Australia to play? What does it mean specifically to step up from a leadership [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3733.96s)]
*  perspective in this region? More clarity is needed, and what they're getting so far is spend more, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3739.16s)]
*  but that's not on what, you know, it's, it's, there's a lot of competing challenges in Australia, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3747.32s)]
*  as you say, that it is an election year and asking for more money after Australia just made a very [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3755.32s)]
*  large investment in the submarines. I think, you know, the quote, the check cleared for $500 million. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3761.0s)]
*  Is that how much it was? I think it was $500 million. But what else should be bought? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3769.24s)]
*  There's limited opportunities here to buy big capabilities because they're going to be competing [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3776.76s)]
*  against the social requirements here, the Medicare and pensions and all the social programs that [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3783.64s)]
*  Australians love and don't want to lose. That's going to be big in this election and inflation, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3789.8s)]
*  just like in the U.S., has hit Australia hard. So things would be really hard to sell spend more [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3795.0s)]
*  on defense without being very clear about on what and what we're all working towards. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3801.4s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, since you alluded to Bridges confirmation hearing, I think he said 3% of [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3806.76s)]
*  referring to the hearing yesterday. So, so that's a political football. Stefan? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3812.04s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, I think that there's going to need to be the U.S. needs to find a way of [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3820.76s)]
*  bringing allies into a joint conversation about planning and and to some extent, see to and what [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3826.44s)]
*  I mean by that is that there is a lot that Australia could contribute and probably contribute better. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3833.5600000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of a Stacey said, I mean, there's a lot of unspoken or explicit assumptions that have [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3839.32s)]
*  never really been tested. And we need to find those assumptions will only really be tested [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3843.5600000000004s)]
*  if there is an honest conversation about what countries would be willing to do what their [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3848.52s)]
*  relative priorities would be. And that needs political cover. And I think that a conversation [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3852.76s)]
*  that is framed around we have a war plan, we will show you a small little part that we expect you to [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3858.76s)]
*  do is not going to get you the political cover to kind of like enter into those kinds of conversations. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3864.12s)]
*  So I think thinking through the political military level as to the framework through which you have [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3870.92s)]
*  conversations about who does what and also to some extent, accepting that that might include [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3877.16s)]
*  certain American, you know, U.S. entering into dependencies that if you expect the Australians to [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3882.6s)]
*  take care of, you know, say protection of shipping into Australia or so that that creates [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3890.52s)]
*  dependencies on the on the part of the U.S. that need to be managed. I think that those kinds of [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3895.7999999999997s)]
*  recalibrating the political military approaches and recalibrating the level of depend- dependence [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3901.96s)]
*  that comes with greater reliance and greater ally stepping up, I think that's where more so than even [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3909.2400000000002s)]
*  practical preparations, the important choices need to be made. I wholeheartedly agree with [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3916.52s)]
*  Stefan and Courtney as that's what my chapter wrote about. But I would also say that I think [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3924.6000000000004s)]
*  the Trump administration in particular needs to remember that this is a two-way street and if you [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3930.04s)]
*  really want to, you know, strengthen resiliency, you know, wean supply chains off of China for [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3936.04s)]
*  some things and create sort of your greater combined strength that they need to probably [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3942.36s)]
*  abandon a little bit of the America first approach all the time. You know, if you have [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3952.7599999999998s)]
*  allies that are contributing more, they also are going to need to see some benefits and in particular [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3957.4s)]
*  in the industrial base area, you're going to have to see, you know, it might not make it doesn't [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3962.36s)]
*  make sense, I don't think, to just say buy American because American companies can't produce enough of [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3967.8s)]
*  it. So we need to build up more industry that creates more redundancy and resiliency for everyone. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3972.92s)]
*  Okay, Matt, bring us on. Yeah, I'll be blunter and perhaps more in the more immediate term. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3979.8799999999997s)]
*  I think there is a clear need for the US administration to articulate how specifically [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3989.24s)]
*  it proposes to contribute to strategic stability within the Indo-Pacific space because this is [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=3996.4399999999996s)]
*  going to be especially important if you want to bring third and fourth order partners along. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4003.96s)]
*  It's going to be necessary, for instance, for Indonesia to give the okay to allow overflight [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4010.52s)]
*  and transit and possibly even resupply in the event of a crisis. How are you going to convince [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4015.8s)]
*  Jakarta that doing anything other than hedging and effectively remaining neutral is actually [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4021.48s)]
*  in their interests and something that they should be doing? And I'd actually put it further in terms [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4029.56s)]
*  of the sort of messaging context within Australia that there is significant alarm that the United [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4035.64s)]
*  States may end up as being largely indifferent to Australian interests when it comes to competition, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4044.04s)]
*  strategic competition with China and at worst potentially even hostile to those interests. So [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4051.32s)]
*  I think very, very clear messaging on precisely what is expected of allies, precisely how the [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4057.88s)]
*  United States makes the region a more stable place and if it doesn't, then why it is, what incentive [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4064.04s)]
*  structures there are for others to cooperate with the United States. And I think that this is [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4072.28s)]
*  something that we will really badly need within at least the next six months or so. Otherwise, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4077.88s)]
*  the conversations that are already happening in Australia's strategic policy circles about, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4085.2400000000002s)]
*  okay, well, where do we hedge? Where do we diverge and where do we potentially disengage [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4089.4s)]
*  are only going to accelerate. Yeah, and that's a hard thing because of the demonstration effects, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4094.52s)]
*  as we said at the beginning of what's happening in alliances elsewhere. So that's a good charge [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4099.16s)]
*  for the administration, but it also sets the bar pretty high on both sides. I want to thank [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4103.4800000000005s)]
*  everybody for the chapters. I want to thank everybody in the audience for joining us. I [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4110.2s)]
*  really recommend you read the volume. I don't know about you guys, but I think the volume's [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4114.76s)]
*  terrific. I've read lots of stuff about alliances over the last decade, particularly in Pacific Asia [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4119.4s)]
*  and there's a lot of cheerleading, which is good because we all believe in these alliances as the [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4124.84s)]
*  bedrock of deterrence and strategy, but it's also necessary, particularly as the operational [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4131.16s)]
*  questions have gotten harder to dig in. And these questions are really thorny, as we were saying at [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4136.84s)]
*  the beginning. So this volume, these chapters go a long way, I think, not just to frame the issues, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4142.6s)]
*  but also to be really quite, as I said at the beginning, prescriptive. And so it charts a [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4148.76s)]
*  course that the governments can follow or not follow, but it certainly has an action agenda [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4153.88s)]
*  where we don't just admire the problem, but we actually think hard about what we need to do to [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4157.88s)]
*  meet the moment. We're going to do this again in Australia. We'll do it in Sydney. We'll do it in [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4162.6s)]
*  Canberra. We'll do it in Melbourne and Perth. So I'll be down there with some of you and look [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4167.64s)]
*  forward to that. In any case, I want to thank the audience for joining us. Hope you'll read the [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4173.0s)]
*  volume. It's on the Carnegie website, downloadable, and thanks again for joining us. Thanks, team. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4176.360000000001s)]
*  Really appreciate it. Thanks, Evan. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7YX3HBQNIM&t=4181.88s)]
