*  Thank you Eric. Demonstrating how statistics can be misleading what you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=224.08s)]
*  didn't disclose is I was in the top 6% of finishers by age. Jake it's wonderful [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=229.36s)]
*  to have you here back here at Carnegie and thank you very much again for doing [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  this. This is the culminating event for our junior fellows at the end of a year [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  in which they've spent as research assistants spread across our programs [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=244.28s)]
*  and it's an important final event for them and we're really glad to have you [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=248.24s)]
*  here with us today. I'm gonna start by tackling the the kind of subject matter [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=252.08s)]
*  of the conference which is based on young people and the world they face [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=256.44s)]
*  today and I wondered as you if you could take yourself back to when you were [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=260.36s)]
*  graduating college and the issues that we faced at that time around the turn of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=265.24s)]
*  the century. Which issues stand out to you as different today in terms of the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=271.08s)]
*  things that young people need to think about as they go out into the world for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=277.08s)]
*  the first time. You know in answering that question I was just thinking about [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=282.22s)]
*  a comment that a distinguished former diplomat made under Chatham House rules [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=288.26s)]
*  so I can't identify who it was but I need to semi attribute it because it's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=295.22s)]
*  not my own observation but I think it's a very powerful observation and he said [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=299.54s)]
*  basically you had a first chapter post World War two basically 1945 to 1989 [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=304.22s)]
*  the Cold War and he characterized that as order with danger and then from 1989 [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=311.94s)]
*  until quite recently you had the post Cold War era which he characterized as [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=321.18s)]
*  order with opportunity and excitement and now we're in a new era which he [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=327.74s)]
*  characterized as order disorder with danger and excitement and I think that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=335.9s)]
*  is a very apt way of putting things I mean the biggest difference between when [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=343.46s)]
*  I graduated from college in 1998 and people coming out today and heading into [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=349.06s)]
*  the world is that we are in a moment where the post Cold War era is over I [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=353.73999999999995s)]
*  came in as it was in full blossom and where there is a competition and a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=362.66s)]
*  contestation underway over what comes next and that brings huge challenges [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  huge but it also brings some really exciting opportunities those [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  opportunities exist in the realm of economics they exist in the realm of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=378.06s)]
*  technology and they exist in the realm of global public problem-solving from [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=381.54s)]
*  the climate crisis to public health on down the line and so I think the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=387.3s)]
*  opportunity for young people to come into this world and write what this era [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=392.42s)]
*  will be is a unique moment that did not exist when I came out of college there [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=397.58s)]
*  was a kind of a defined track for it and did not exist for the decades of the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=404.65999999999997s)]
*  clearly defined track and that has vexing questions there are massive [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=409.38s)]
*  challenges real threats but also really just extraordinary opportunities that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=418.86s)]
*  accompany the kind of technological revolution we're going through and the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=424.22s)]
*  possibility to think fundamentally differently about how the world should be [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=427.74s)]
*  If you were to translate that analysis into particularly the opportunity that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  you highlight in that this is an imaginative creative moment if you were [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  to translate that analysis into advice which I'm sure I mean I often joke that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=447.18s)]
*  I get asked to more coffees than I can possibly drink but into advice that you [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  would give to somebody entering a foreign policy career today because it [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=457.7s)]
*  seems I mean people I was at my 25th reunion this weekend and people keep [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=462.1s)]
*  asking me how how is Washington DC and I say as the kids say the vibes are not [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=466.82000000000005s)]
*  great you know it can be a discouraging moment to think about going into a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=471.46000000000004s)]
*  foreign policy career if you were giving advice to somebody going out into the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=475.74s)]
*  world what what piece of advice either do you wish you would have had back then [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=480.14000000000004s)]
*  or what what what advice would you give somebody today so I'll give one piece of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=483.70000000000005s)]
*  advice that's more practical and one piece that's more conceptual the the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=487.54s)]
*  practical piece of advice I would give is that as you choose jobs or potential [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=492.62s)]
*  postgraduate study of one kind or another the single biggest variable that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=498.02000000000004s)]
*  you should account for by a mile is who will be your mentor it's less important [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=502.26000000000005s)]
*  what your title is even exactly what field you choose even exactly how much [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=508.66s)]
*  you get paid then it is is are you gonna be working with and for someone who will [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=514.58s)]
*  teach you and be your champion and by far in terms of launching a successful [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  career in foreign policy as in anything else make that your your ideal question [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=526.38s)]
*  and if you find a job you really like but you just feel like there's not [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=531.5s)]
*  someone there who can be your mentor that doesn't automatically mean don't do [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=535.62s)]
*  it but it for me that'd be a really significant demerit because that should [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  be a defining variable for people in their 20s in my view and my mentors had [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=543.94s)]
*  just a huge impact on my life the mentors from my 20s the conceptual [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=549.46s)]
*  piece of advice is that there is no way in my view to play a critical role in [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=554.1s)]
*  this conversation about what comes next without being very conversant in [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=559.5400000000001s)]
*  technology particularly artificial intelligence but I think increasingly [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=566.3800000000001s)]
*  biotechnology which I think is underappreciated for how big a [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=569.86s)]
*  revolution we are going through in that as well and what impacts that will have [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=574.1800000000001s)]
*  on geopolitics and geoeconomics second to operate at the intersection of foreign [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=577.34s)]
*  policy and domestic policy would be ecumenical and not just think all I do [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=583.14s)]
*  is stuff over there because the intersection between domestic policy and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=586.34s)]
*  foreign policy has become so much busier in terms of where the big calls are being [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=591.3000000000001s)]
*  made the big strategic calls are being made and then third to pay attention to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=596.18s)]
*  how ideas and arguments are being disseminated and absorbed this is [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=603.5s)]
*  something I didn't think as much about in 1998 because we had a fairly static [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=612.9399999999999s)]
*  information ecosystem which really kind of started changing dramatically with [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=616.5799999999999s)]
*  social media but I think today being mindful of if I'm going to write or [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=621.5s)]
*  speak or engage what is the platform who is the audience and who's not hearing me [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=627.02s)]
*  because of the way that things have been segmented and and and I frankly think [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=634.3s)]
*  too often we think about what the content of the message is without [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=640.06s)]
*  thinking what the medium of the message is and my view is that you guys are [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=644.38s)]
*  going to have to really be focused on that to make sure that you're you're [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=650.5s)]
*  actually contributing to the debate in a way that makes a significant impact I [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=655.74s)]
*  like the frame of who's not hearing me as a good kind of question to ask oneself [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=660.7s)]
*  as you're doing work it's also a good segue into the foreign policy for a [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=667.26s)]
*  middle class because in some sense I think one of the inspirations for you [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=672.02s)]
*  small people politically for that work was that there was a large group of [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=676.94s)]

*  in Minnesota Jake gave a graduation speech at the Humphrey School I think [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=695.62s)]
*  several years ago and the headline or the main kind of takeaway that he gave [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=701.1s)]
*  as a piece of advice was don't be a jerk which was a perfect outgrowth of [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=706.66s)]
*  Minnesota nice I wonder if you could say something about kind of how you think [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=712.5s)]
*  your upbringing has informed your career and how you approach a foreign policy [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=718.38s)]
*  career well for one thing I grew up in Minnesota in the 1980s this was sort of [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=723.9399999999999s)]
*  the height of the late Cold War they made a Red Dawn remake in the last few [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=728.9399999999999s)]
*  years I don't know if anyone saw it but I think the enemy was North Korea that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=735.18s)]
*  North Korea was invading the United States or something okay the original [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=738.4599999999999s)]
*  Red Dawn where the Russians invaded America okay this is 1980s it was rocky [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=742.16s)]
*  for you know as rocky fighting Yvonne Drago then it was the Berlin Wall coming [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=748.8s)]
*  down it was the collapse of the Soviet Union it was a time of a view of the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  United States and our role in the world and the possibilities and vindication of [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=761.98s)]
*  democratic ideals the free world that did have a big impact on me and does to [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=767.7s)]
*  this day even as the world has changed so that's one thing second thing is you [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=774.58s)]
*  know I grew up in in the Twin Cities in Minnesota and we had a globe on our [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=778.86s)]
*  kitchen table and my parents really taught me like you are about as far [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=783.7s)]
*  from the oceans as you know some people can get in the US but you have to care [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=787.74s)]
*  about what happens over there because it has a big impact here I had parents who [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=792.82s)]
*  believed in that deeply and exposed me to that and I went off to college to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=796.62s)]
*  study international relations from Minnesota with that very much in mind [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=801.02s)]
*  when I was in the situation room or in on the seventh floor in the secretary's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=806.46s)]
*  conference room at the State Department it struck me that foreign policy had [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=812.1800000000001s)]
*  gotten disaggregated from or was disembodied in a way where to become [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=817.06s)]
*  very abstract and people weren't asking the question what does this actually [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=822.5s)]
*  mean for a working family a middle-class family in Minnesota or or elsewhere [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=825.6199999999999s)]
*  across the country and so that's really what motivated the project that myself [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=830.66s)]
*  Salman Ahmed and others pursued here in foreign policy for the middle class and [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=835.54s)]
*  it had two dimensions to it one was how do we go engage working people you know [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=839.42s)]
*  Americans across this country on questions of foreign policy and connect [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=845.3399999999999s)]
*  foreign policy to their lives that was the more communicative aspect the other [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=849.8599999999999s)]
*  was a substantive aspect how do we take what they're saying to us when we go to [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=854.02s)]
*  Nebraska or Colorado as we came to see you when you were out there or Ohio or [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=857.42s)]
*  elsewhere and actually incorporated into the substance of our foreign policy not [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=861.8199999999999s)]
*  so much a messaging or communication argument but actually what should we do [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=865.42s)]
*  differently in our foreign policy that is more reflective of and relevant to [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  making working people's lives better safer and easier and really it was you [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=873.86s)]
*  know as national security advisor I was much more focused in a sense on the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=879.22s)]
*  substantive piece because I wasn't out traveling the country communicating very [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=883.02s)]
*  focused on how do we actually do this how do we build a new industrial strategy [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=888.82s)]
*  how do we ensure that national security incorporates domestic economic policy [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=892.82s)]
*  technology policy how do we think about ending an era of wars that had gotten [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=898.74s)]
*  totally disconnected from the relevance to the lives of your ordinary American [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=903.82s)]
*  etc and that was a big motivator for me in the four years I spent as national [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=910.7800000000001s)]
*  security advisor as you I mean you got to do both parts of something that we [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=914.82s)]
*  think about a lot at Carnegie which is you know we think about doing research [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=920.3000000000001s)]
*  we think about putting it in a format that can be useful to policymakers [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=923.94s)]
*  concrete enough that they can operationalize it you got to do the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=929.5s)]
*  research and then be in a very important position for implementing it what can you [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=933.74s)]
*  give one example of something that you were able to kind of push through that [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=940.54s)]
*  was inspired in part by your thinking about foreign policy for the middle [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=944.3s)]
*  class and one place where either bureaucracy or you know the way that we [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=948.74s)]
*  have organized resources in the US government ended up being a roadblock to [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=953.7s)]
*  kind of implementing what was a good policy idea I mean in a sense it's the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=957.5s)]
*  same answer to both questions and it is the the industrial strategy the Biden [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=961.78s)]
*  administration pursued which was to focus investments in strategic sectors [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=966.66s)]
*  to build out our industrial and innovation base with huge economic [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=971.82s)]
*  impacts across America for and modernize our infrastructure along the way to make [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=976.38s)]
*  our engines of economic growth more durable more vibrant and more equitable [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=985.5799999999999s)]
*  and more geographically distributed and we set a course to make that happen and [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=990.42s)]
*  a huge amount of the inspiration for that work came out of Carnegie went into [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=996.62s)]
*  the Biden campaign and then went into the Biden White House's actual exercise [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1001.4599999999999s)]
*  of in my view both an economic policy and a national security strategy but the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1005.5s)]
*  timelines for the delivery on that were longer than a four-year election cycle [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1013.26s)]
*  and you know I did a podcast with Ezra Klein at the end of my time as national [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1021.66s)]
*  security advisor I made this observation that you know our timeline was on a [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1028.8s)]
*  longer cycle not not by choice but just the execution of this and the political [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1033.7s)]
*  cycle is four years and that mismatch had impact in my view so then a couple [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1039.5s)]
*  months later Ezra wrote a column where he started with that observation for me [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1046.06s)]
*  and then he called me up and he said you know basically will you get off your [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1050.66s)]
*  chest all of your frustrations and and pathologies about the obstacles in the [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1056.26s)]
*  way of building at speed and scale which I proceeded to do you can read the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1063.98s)]
*  column I called it kind of radicalizing because I basically think the insight [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1068.3s)]
*  of his and Derek Thompson's book abundance it's an incomplete story of [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1072.3799999999999s)]
*  the American economy and I think the critics I think miss that they're not [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1078.02s)]
*  trying to tell a complete story they're trying to identify one thing and say [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1081.8999999999999s)]
*  this is a problem I felt that problem acutely every day and part of what drove [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1084.94s)]
*  that problem for me was that it takes 27 people to say yes to something to build [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1090.02s)]
*  it to move it for it takes one person to say no and that makes implementing the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1095.62s)]
*  kind of ambitious policy that we had in mind extremely difficult and I think [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1101.1399999999999s)]
*  that as we reflect on the Biden years but more generally as you guys think [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1105.4199999999998s)]
*  about what comes next down the road taking on the practical question of how [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1111.6999999999998s)]
*  does government actually work how do we actually deliver and do it on a timely [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1116.34s)]
*  and efficient basis that sounds a little bit like kind of boring technocracy [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1121.6999999999998s)]
*  that's the difference in my view between success and failure over the long term [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1126.3799999999999s)]
*  and is an incredibly important part of the policy conversation as we go [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1130.46s)]
*  forward it's really interesting I mean it has become a catchphrase that is [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1134.22s)]
*  common to political campaigns on both sides of the aisle that America needs to [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1139.54s)]
*  get back into the business of doing big things and the point about the kind of [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1145.22s)]
*  structural difficulty of committing to big things in an era in which both sides [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1149.82s)]
*  to some extent tend to in a knee-jerk fashion think about repealing what the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1154.74s)]
*  previous yeah team has done it makes big I mean it's another aspect of it that I [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1160.1s)]
*  think is quite powerful which is not only do we have to go faster but it's [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1165.1s)]
*  not like you shouldn't just be like well I got to get stuff done in four years [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1168.3s)]
*  just so it can get undone over the next four years you also need a considerable [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1171.3s)]
*  degree of continuity in the commitments that you make and we're seeing right now [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1176.62s)]
*  with things like the Inflation Reduction Act a real question about how much of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1180.02s)]
*  that bet that we made on the future of America's kind of energy infrastructure [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1184.1799999999998s)]
*  and energy industrial leadership how much that bets gonna survive and how [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1190.4199999999998s)]
*  much of it's gonna get thrown to the wayside and and that is its own [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1195.02s)]
*  challenge that other countries among them just to pick one at random China [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1198.78s)]
*  don't have to worry about quite as much to take the doing big things long-term [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1203.94s)]
*  commitments and marry it to the 27 people saying yes and one saying no or [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1212.0600000000002s)]
*  maybe in another context 31 saying yes and one thing now I want to turn to NATO [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1218.3000000000002s)]
*  and there's an upcoming summit obviously NATO stands as a project that the United [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1222.7s)]
*  States with its allies led and has been committed to now for 80 years and [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1230.0s)]
*  there's an open question about not only NATO specifically but about the United [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1235.96s)]
*  States approach to alliances more generally and I wonder whether you think [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1240.96s)]
*  that it is possible that the United States can construct a reasonable [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1246.0s)]
*  national security strategy that de-emphasizes alliances or whether the [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1252.8s)]
*  background conditions are such that eventually will come even if we turn [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1257.58s)]
*  away we are turning away in some meaningful ways right now we will come [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1262.4199999999998s)]
*  back to a conclusion that there is no way for US prosperity and security to be [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1267.1799999999998s)]
*  defended without a deep investment in alliances and then look for me this [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1272.6399999999999s)]
*  comes down to basic arithmetic the United States is 25% of the world's GDP [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1276.6599999999999s)]
*  when you bring together our allies and very core partners were something like [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1281.3799999999999s)]
*  so another way to formulate your question is is it better to approach [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1286.58s)]
*  the problems of the world with 25% of the economic potential and capacity or [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1291.6200000000001s)]
*  with 60% and that answer seems totally self-evident to me and that it's a [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1296.02s)]
*  it's a complete just drain of advantage to give that away and that's not just [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1301.78s)]
*  true in the kind of pure question of economic output and leverage but a [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1309.5s)]
*  trusted technology ecosystem for artificial intelligence for [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  telecommunications for biotechnology for a clean energy transition for secure [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1320.3000000000002s)]
*  and resilient supply chains let's just take the the issue of rare earths which [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1325.6200000000001s)]
*  has been very much in the news of late some of these rare earths and magnets [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1330.38s)]
*  are 100% processed in China now one way to solve that problem is to say the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1337.42s)]
*  United States will go it alone and we'll just deal with it all ourselves mining [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1345.0600000000002s)]
*  processing the whole thing and then the other way is to say ah we have a bunch [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1348.38s)]

*  going to get dragged back into another war in Europe which we have managed not [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1421.02s)]

*  can point to as a kind of concrete example of international cooperation was [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1439.26s)]
*  leading the defense contact group that Secretary Austin chaired for I forget [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1443.46s)]

*  declined to chair that contact group and so there's some question about how the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1467.42s)]
*  leadership of that will go forward without without asking you to critique [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1471.1s)]

*  Ukraine war so far if you were looking to the future where would you go from [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1482.26s)]
*  here in terms of what's the most important things that could be done [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1489.26s)]
*  going from where we are today I think the critical point here that when the [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1492.9s)]
*  Trump administration came in they cast the war in terms of you're either for [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1501.3400000000001s)]
*  war or you're for peace and I think that that was a false framing the real [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1510.14s)]
*  framing is we all want to see peace in Ukraine and the choices between a true [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1516.9s)]
*  piece that is just and sustainable and a false piece that is essentially a [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1523.26s)]
*  surrender to Putin and then the second thing when the Trump administration came [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1527.7s)]
*  in they did is they said Ukraine is the obstacle to peace and President [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1531.7800000000002s)]
*  Zelensky has now shown in living color that Ukraine is prepared to have an [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1539.8600000000001s)]
*  immediate ceasefire and it's Putin who's refusing the ceasefire and it has been [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1545.62s)]
*  exposed over the course of time that this premise it's Ukraine that is [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1549.62s)]
*  responsible for the continuation of the war is wrong and it is in fact Russia so [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1553.6999999999998s)]
*  I say that as a backdrop to what we need to do going from here President Trump [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1558.9799999999998s)]
*  says he wants to get to a peaceful outcome in Ukraine a good deal a good [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1565.9799999999998s)]
*  deal requires leverage and leverage requires staying power it requires [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1570.82s)]
*  showing Putin that the United States is going to stand behind Ukraine continue [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1575.18s)]
*  to supply Ukraine with capability and continue to increase pressure on Russia [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1581.74s)]
*  until such time as Russia's prepared to come to the table to deal seriously that [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1585.74s)]
*  is the basic physics of an effective strategy to get to a good true peace and [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1590.5s)]
*  that is a path available to the president and what's interesting is he's [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1597.6200000000001s)]
*  mused about it he's mused openly about should I impose sanctions and so forth [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1601.86s)]
*  you know do I need to get tougher on Vladimir and I think we should all [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1606.02s)]
*  collectively be saying yes you do have to do those things now he has proven [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1609.4199999999998s)]
*  thus far unwilling to actually take that step and I don't know if that will [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1614.5s)]
*  continue but there is in my view a pathway to improve Ukraine's position on [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1617.4199999999998s)]
*  the battlefield to weaken Russia economically and in doing so to improve [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1621.6599999999999s)]
*  Ukraine's position at the negotiating table that could set the stage for a [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1628.74s)]
*  ceasefire and ultimately an enduring peace that works and and that is the [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1633.18s)]
*  formula that I think should be pursued that could be pursued that the [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1636.5s)]
*  Europeans would be on board with as well as many of those other 50 countries you [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1640.5s)]
*  referred to in the Ukraine defense contact group and let's see what happens [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1644.18s)]
*  but you know I think the path to a true peace is clear and the path to a false [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1650.6599999999999s)]
*  peace basically trying to squeeze Ukraine or abandon Ukraine until they [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1658.22s)]
*  surrender to Putin that will come back to bite us hard down the road I want to [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1661.7s)]
*  we have a bunch of questions that are coming in from the audience and I will [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1666.14s)]
*  turn to them in a moment but I want to try to tie kind of three things together [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1670.42s)]
*  here it is clear to me what the stakes are of getting to a good peace in [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1673.58s)]
*  Ukraine partly because the United States depends on our partnerships with allies [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1681.14s)]
*  and it is crucially important to Europe but I wonder how you would make the case [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1687.62s)]
*  to those across this country who say why why does it matter to us why does it [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1693.2199999999998s)]
*  matter in Minnesota why should we care about what happens there so first I'm [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1701.2199999999998s)]
*  not a public opinion expert but I confess my doubts with what I think is [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1708.9799999999998s)]
*  the Washington Conventional wisdom that the American people have kind of given [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1715.58s)]
*  up on Ukraine and that they need to be convinced you know the most recent [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1718.6999999999998s)]
*  public opinion data I've seen if you combine they basically ask is the US [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1724.86s)]
*  doing too much too little or the right amount for Ukraine and if you combine [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1731.5s)]
*  the right amount and too little it is significantly more than too much meaning [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1735.3799999999999s)]
*  the actual percentage of people who are saying we're doing too much for Ukraine [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1741.78s)]
*  is way below 50% why is that I think it's because the American people have [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1744.54s)]
*  two instincts they're both astute and and kind of elemental to the American [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1751.06s)]
*  character one is we side with the little guy over the bully so it's a kind of [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1759.22s)]
*  basic notion of we don't like aggressors and we would like to be supporting those [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1764.22s)]
*  standing up to aggressors the victims who are being aggressed and and so [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1768.94s)]
*  that's a more kind of gut kind of feel and and there's a nobility and that's [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1773.5s)]
*  why you saw so many Ukrainian flags come out of I don't even know where they came [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1780.14s)]
*  out of to be honest with you I don't know how so many Ukrainian flags were [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1783.98s)]
*  produced that got on people's front porches and doors in the months after the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1787.32s)]
*  second is that people understand that if you allow aggression to go unchecked and [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1791.5s)]
*  if Putin ends up achieving his objectives in Ukraine it makes the rest of Europe [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1795.54s)]
*  more vulnerable and unstable and that in turn makes the United States more [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1800.14s)]
*  vulnerable and unstable and people I think get that basic logic as well so in [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1804.3000000000002s)]
*  my view actually we should heed where I think a majority on a bipartisan basis [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1808.96s)]
*  the American people are and continue supporting Ukraine and we should heed a [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1816.8200000000002s)]
*  strong majority of members of the US Congress both Democrats and Republicans [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1820.48s)]
*  both House and Senate who think we should continue to support Ukraine and [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1825.38s)]
*  then it's really this administration who's out of step with where the [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1828.7s)]
*  American people are where the Congress is when it comes to this question not [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1833.18s)]
*  the other way around. Great I'm going to turn to questions from the audience and [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1836.18s)]
*  there are many many coming in I'm going to start with probably a tough one which [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1840.3000000000002s)]
*  is around Gaza there are several questions around Gaza this conference [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1847.42s)]
*  revolves around youth and future opportunities for youth and foreign [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1851.0600000000002s)]
*  policy and obviously young people are disproportionately represented among the [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1854.14s)]
*  population of Gaza and there's a question about how you think Israel the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1858.64s)]
*  Israel Hamas war has impacted Gaza's youth population and then a second [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1864.0400000000002s)]
*  question which I'll bundle with this which is you will be teaching next year [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1867.7s)]
*  and you probably have thought about what your students are going to ask about the [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1871.48s)]
*  lessons that you took away from your time in office with respect to the war [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1876.2800000000002s)]
*  and how do you think you will address those questions? So I mean first the [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1881.26s)]
*  impact of this war on young people in Gaza has been absolutely god-awful [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1890.94s)]
*  tragic and catastrophic at every level and I think there can be a caricature of [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1897.94s)]
*  policymakers that you know we're typically seen standing behind podiums or [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1907.26s)]
*  Sunday she would show interviews and not really seen kind of in our full [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1914.1599999999999s)]
*  three-dimensional form but like sitting watching this tragedy engaging in the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1918.1399999999999s)]
*  policymaking of the US government during this completely horrific war a tragedy [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1924.52s)]
*  begun on October 7th and continued every day since it you can't [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1931.06s)]
*  you can't be human and not be affected by the pain and the suffering and the [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1939.22s)]
*  hell that people have gone through young people very much among them so then the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1947.1399999999999s)]
*  question comes now which I'll engage with my students on which I'm very happy [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1956.36s)]
*  to engage with people here on as well you know reflecting back are there [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1962.78s)]
*  things we could have or should have done differently and when you see how things [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1969.9799999999998s)]
*  have gone since October 7th till now if you're like no no shouldn't have done [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1973.6s)]
*  anything differently just kind of knee-jerk you're not human like you [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1979.62s)]
*  you're not taking in like so much pain and suffering couldn't we have done [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1983.8s)]
*  something to avert that but what and that's where it becomes harder is is [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1986.92s)]
*  saying what policy choice at what point what was the thing I think people have [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1991.8s)]
*  different views on that there's a strong argument about cutoff weapons and so [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=1999.64s)]
*  forth and I've addressed elsewhere just the challenges of facing US policymakers [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2004.2s)]
*  in this regard one of which was Israel wasn't just fighting Hamas it was [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2010.16s)]
*  actually under attack from multiple different directions all at once which [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2013.66s)]
*  complicated the question of weapons provision to a significant extent were [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2017.0600000000002s)]
*  there things we could have done differently in the negotiating process [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2022.78s)]
*  of trying to get to a ceasefire hostage deal were the things we could have done [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2025.5800000000002s)]
*  differently I woke up every day and got a report on humanitarian aid how many [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2030.94s)]
*  trucks were going in through how many crossings how many of those trucks were [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2035.9s)]
*  actually being delivered and distributed and I was on the phone just repeatedly [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2039.2s)]
*  regularly driving pushing to get more in and I actually do think the difference [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2043.88s)]
*  between what we were able to get in and what we've seen in this complete siege [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2048.12s)]
*  over the past couple months is a reflection of actual policymakers actual [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2051.32s)]
*  people sitting in the US government pushing to get a better outcome but this [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2056.52s)]
*  is something that I you know I've been out of government now it seems like [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2062.04s)]
*  forever in a way because it feels so distant but it's been of just a few [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2065.52s)]
*  months and I'm gonna keep reflecting on this over the long term to say at some [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2068.88s)]
*  point could I identify here are two or three things it could have and should [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2073.94s)]
*  have done now looking back in hindsight or you know at the time and I don't have [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2078.1800000000003s)]
*  that list yet I don't but do I have the question like buried deep in my brain [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2085.34s)]
*  and have it come out on a daily basis absolutely because it is just an [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2089.78s)]
*  unspeakable horrific tragedy and the war needs to come to an end and you know [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2095.22s)]
*  when the ceasefire and hostage deal went into effect that was phase one of what [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2101.4399999999996s)]
*  should have been a roadmap to an end of the war months ago and I believe that [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2106.7799999999997s)]
*  that I would like to see that happen as soon as possible. The next question is [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2112.2599999999998s)]
*  about nuclear risks what lessons did you take from the war in Ukraine about [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2118.9399999999996s)]
*  managing nuclear risks and particularly about managing escalation risk between [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2124.82s)]
*  nuclear armed adversaries? You know it's interesting one of the differences [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2129.02s)]
*  between growing up in the 1980s and growing up today is just the presence of [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2136.94s)]
*  the possibility of nuclear war is so much more attenuated now like you guys [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2142.78s)]
*  probably don't spend a lot of time thinking about nuclear war the way that [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2148.98s)]
*  it was so central to just the overall narrative of our lives even in the 1980s [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2153.7s)]
*  even more so in the 50s and 60s with you know they used to have drills where [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2159.06s)]
*  people get under their their desks you know it's kind of a silly to think [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2165.3799999999997s)]
*  about if like a nuclear warhead comes in you know like getting under your desk is [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2170.2599999999998s)]
*  probably not gonna help that much but really really present and I think [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2174.22s)]
*  because of that there's a certain casualness with it where all that could [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2179.64s)]
*  never happen you know that's all BS but if you're the president of the United [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2183.72s)]
*  States and your intelligence leadership comes to you and says if there's a [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2188.8399999999997s)]
*  complete collapse of Russian lines you know there's a an even chance that Russia [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2193.64s)]
*  will have the first use of nuclear weapons since Hiroshima and Nagasaki if [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2198.92s)]
*  you're president United States you're gonna take that seriously because as a [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2205.4s)]
*  you don't just have a cable news hit later in the day to say ah who cares you [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2209.4s)]
*  own that risk you own it in a big way but you also the thing I learned about [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2212.56s)]
*  it was you have to take it seriously you have to think about how you seek to [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2218.76s)]
*  deter it but you can't be paralyzed by it you got to keep up the effort of [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2222.28s)]
*  trying to support Ukraine and not get cowed out of that support and I believe [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2228.56s)]
*  throughout the fall of 22 despite some caricatures and somehow we backed off we [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2233.4s)]
*  continue to supply Ukraine with advanced capabilities throughout that [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2237.94s)]
*  period because we were determined not to let this steer us off course of our [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2241.5s)]
*  support for Ukraine so so that's how I think about it we have to take the [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2245.5s)]
*  possibility of nuclear war that is something a president of the United [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2250.0s)]
*  States of any party has to think about but you can't be paralyzed by it it just [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2252.9s)]
*  has to be a factor that you are managing in the context of an overall strategy I [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2256.7000000000003s)]
*  want to follow up with the question that's come in about something that's [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2261.78s)]
*  happening as we speak which is reports of a drawdown of the US Embassy in Iraq [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2265.38s)]
*  various movements around our military installations in the region our former [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2269.7400000000002s)]
*  ambassador Israel Dan Shapiro is speculating that this could reflect a [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2276.54s)]
*  major threat but it could also be signaling how do you read what's going [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2280.7400000000002s)]
*  on right now it's all just happened so it's hard for me to speculate we have [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2285.6600000000003s)]
*  had threats against our embassy over the course of the past many years in [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2291.5s)]
*  Baghdad and this could be a response to that at the same time if you were gaming [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2295.06s)]
*  out what you would do to send a signal of the potential use of military force [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2300.62s)]
*  these are some of the kinds of moves you might make as well and in the context of [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2305.22s)]
*  Iran negotiations that could very well be what is happening but I think this is a [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2309.2599999999998s)]
*  case where when you make a muscle movement of this kind you have a [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2315.7s)]
*  responsibility to explain to the American people why you're doing it and I [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2319.18s)]
*  hope that the Trump administration will do so because my speculation from here [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2322.26s)]
*  just on the basis of initial news accounts is pretty much worth what you [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2326.1400000000003s)]
*  guys are currently paying for which is nothing thank you for not charging us [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2329.78s)]
*  your normal rate next question is about AI given your appreciation for vannevar [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2335.2200000000003s)]
*  bushes a new frontier and the opportunity promised by emerging [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2343.78s)]
*  technology as well as your awareness of the threats of danger and disorder how [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2346.84s)]
*  would you forecast potential pathways of a way forward for the US on AI so I [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2350.9s)]
*  think forecasting on AI is really difficult because some of the smartest [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2359.7000000000003s)]
*  scientific minds in the world who are extremely close to this technology fall [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2365.9s)]
*  along a spectrum from AI is going to be a GI is going to be here in two years to [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2372.86s)]
*  AGI is never going to be here that's a pretty big spectrum and even for those [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2378.94s)]
*  who say no it'll come I think the span from like the 25th percentile of [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2384.26s)]
*  likelihood to 75th percentile of likelihood is sometime between 2028 2046 [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2392.46s)]
*  or 2050 so we have to make policy choices in a condition of really [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2398.02s)]
*  considerable uncertainty so I would say three things first it could come soon so [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2406.06s)]
*  be ready meaning we got to move fast to get prepared second the current [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2411.94s)]
*  administration has indicated a quite laissez-faire approach to this which [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2417.46s)]
*  means business civil society and yes dare I say think tanks I think have a [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2420.94s)]
*  considerable role to play in driving the conversation and trying to shape the [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2424.82s)]
*  guardrails around AI to make it work more for us than against us because I [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2430.0s)]
*  don't think we can just say well we'll wait for the government to regulate or [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2433.18s)]
*  for the Congress to legislate which I don't see happening and then third I [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2436.3799999999997s)]
*  think it's really important that we recognize that we both have this [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2441.2999999999997s)]
*  considerable race condition with China we're both racing ahead and capabilities [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2445.7s)]
*  of AI but also a deep shared interest in the common threat of misalignment or AI [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2449.98s)]
*  harms that could befall the US and China and every other human on earth and so at [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2460.14s)]
*  the same time that we're in a race we need a sustained dialogue with China on [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2465.5s)]
*  risk and the management of AI risk and I think that that we watched that in the [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2468.98s)]
*  Biden administration I don't know if the current administration is taking it [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2475.7799999999997s)]
*  forward but I would really strongly encourage them to do so and I would [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2478.62s)]
*  encourage everyone here to think about the duality of the competition on the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2481.62s)]
*  one hand and the need for responsible diplomacy on the other to be a big part [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2486.42s)]
*  about how we answer this and then I should say one more thing which is it [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2491.04s)]
*  goes back to the early questions you were asking me about how to think about [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2494.1800000000003s)]
*  national security and AI and how to think about national security period one [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2497.66s)]
*  of the biggest national security concerns I have about AI is not a [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2503.2200000000003s)]
*  typical cyber bio thing I am very worried about those its job displacement [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2506.98s)]
*  it's how it's going to hit the structure of our economy and equity in our [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2510.46s)]
*  economy and what that's going to do to social cohesion to just the long-term [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2514.22s)]
*  prospects and health and well-being and welfare of the American people and [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2519.1s)]
*  people everywhere and so I think national security professionals foreign [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2522.7s)]
*  policy professionals have an obligation to care about that issue and how it [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2526.06s)]
*  flows through everything else as much as they do the kind of typical foreign [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2530.3799999999997s)]
*  policy and national security dimensions of artificial intelligence. There's a [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2533.9399999999996s)]
*  question here that kind of asks you to put on your political rather than your [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2538.98s)]
*  policy hat you have been an advisor to obviously the US President a couple of [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2542.36s)]
*  them but you've also been an advisor to a number of candidates and one of the [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2549.1600000000003s)]
*  the issues that the person asking this question identifies is that Democrats [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2553.32s)]
*  have effectively become the party of international engagement and that there [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2558.2400000000002s)]
*  is a rising generation who has seen multiple examples of where the United [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2563.2000000000003s)]
*  States is engagement abroad has left a sour taste in their mouth not least the [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2567.04s)]
*  Iraq war and its legacy. How do you think the Democratic Party should be [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2570.72s)]
*  thinking about how to make policy a foreign policy of engagement something [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2577.3599999999997s)]
*  that is attractive again to voters in the future? Look I'm gonna give the [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2582.12s)]
*  start of an answer I don't if I had a great answer to that question I would go [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2587.9399999999996s)]
*  sell it to a lot of people and who are very interested in it. This is a great [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2593.16s)]
*  question it's a very difficult question I have the beginnings of my own instinct [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2599.64s)]
*  of an answer to it but it probably just an even enunciate it will disqualify me [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2603.16s)]
*  because it seems so abstract but but I think there's something in it. I don't [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2608.04s)]
*  these aren't the right words of the public message but it's the right idea [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2612.44s)]
*  and I'm actually embarrassed even begin my answer because as soon as they say [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2617.48s)]
*  you're gonna be like this guy's talking about political messaging but it goes [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2621.68s)]
*  back to Tocqueville it goes back to Tocqueville okay bear with me okay just [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2624.44s)]
*  bear with me so Tocqueville says kind of what is the essence of the American [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2628.4s)]
*  character that's what he's getting at in democracy in America in 1930 and what he [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2633.7400000000002s)]
*  says is the American people are motivated by self-interest and that's [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2638.56s)]
*  that as a virtue as like a thing to be held up you know not not a some bad [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2641.7200000000003s)]
*  thing but good thing but what's interesting is the American people have [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2648.92s)]
*  a concept of interest rightly understood or in lit enlightened self-interest [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2654.1600000000003s)]
*  basically positive some thinking that you have these rugged individualists the [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2658.36s)]
*  pioneers who help each other out with barn raisings and you have a view in [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2664.1200000000003s)]

*  been a part of our ethos through multiple generations and that you [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2673.44s)]
*  currently have a president who basically has a total zero-sum view like if you're [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2681.1200000000003s)]
*  winning I'm losing and for me to win you have to lose okay I think that that an [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2687.68s)]
*  argument which starts from self-interest okay I care about you and your interest [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2694.16s)]
*  and you doing better now wouldn't you agree for example that having some [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2700.3599999999997s)]
*  allies would actually help you in the reasons we just said once you agree that [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2705.08s)]
*  starting a trade war with every country in the world and hurting the economy is [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2710.8799999999997s)]
*  ultimately come back and raise your prices and hurt you wouldn't you agree [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2714.88s)]
*  that if there's a pandemic that breaks out or an epidemic that breaks out in [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2719.88s)]
*  Africa or to pick another random example in Wuhan China hey that could come and [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2725.0s)]
*  affect you so maybe we should do something to prevent that over there and [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2730.78s)]
*  bring it all back to don't we all agree in the end of the day this [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2734.28s)]
*  quintessentially American positive some notion that I can do better and others [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2738.2400000000002s)]
*  can do better too and in fact if my neighbor's house is on fire I better [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2742.34s)]
*  grab a bucket because otherwise it's coming to my house I think there's [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2746.1800000000003s)]
*  something in that that someone could take and do a lot better job of than [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2750.3s)]
*  I've just done that is a case that is unadulteratedly rooted in interest [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2753.1800000000003s)]
*  self-interest that doesn't suggest somehow you should be trading off your [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2759.6200000000003s)]
*  interest for someone else far away who you don't know that will be highly [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2765.9s)]
*  intuitive to people and then actually can gain some purchase and more purchase [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2771.14s)]
*  than a zero-sum case that is appealing to some people yes but I don't think [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2774.42s)]
*  it's where most Americans are there are several people who have asked questions [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2777.98s)]
*  that pertain to actually wanting to know more about what it was like to be the [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2782.62s)]
*  National Security Advisor what it would like to do that job and so I'm gonna [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2786.62s)]
*  give you a couple of them one is the political hostility outside of the [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2791.02s)]
*  White House ever really affect you in the job as National Security Advisor [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2794.72s)]
*  another is can you talk more about the kind of policy process in the [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2799.62s)]
*  interagency and how you thought about that and managing managing that and can [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2803.46s)]
*  you share a piece of advice that a mentor gave you that was important in [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2809.2999999999997s)]
*  your in your work as NSA yeah sure so yes the political hostility affected me [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2814.2599999999998s)]
*  it bummed me out you know like it that's a big change just in my in the span of [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2823.7s)]
*  my career you know when Secretary Clinton came in as Secretary of State I [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2829.54s)]
*  had Republicans senators down to the State Department to do events with the [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2838.14s)]
*  Foreign Service Officers Secretary Clinton did these huge bipartisan [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2844.1s)]
*  gatherings of members and kinds of things that like are now unthinkable a [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2849.2999999999997s)]
*  mere 15 years later okay it's just been a radical change in my view over the [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2853.26s)]
*  course of a relatively short amount of time not that everything was hunky-dory [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2860.5800000000004s)]
*  but the basic idea of some bipartisan comedy when it came to national security [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2865.42s)]
*  and foreign policy was there and it's gone to the point where I really wonder [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2870.7400000000002s)]
*  you know if we had a major terrorist attack like we did on 9-eleven if [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2878.02s)]
*  everyone would pull together the way they did after 9-eleven or if in fact [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2884.38s)]
*  all of the political kind of physics of today would push things in a much [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2888.46s)]
*  different direction and I really hope we would pull together so sitting there in [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2895.42s)]
*  the midst of that cauldron kind of sucks you know it's like not a pleasant way to [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2902.7s)]
*  operate it would have been much more pleasant to operate where you know being [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2909.62s)]
*  the National Security Advisor you're a bit outside of politics and you can work [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2913.14s)]
*  with everyone and have good faith disagreements and battle out policy and [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2917.06s)]
*  so forth and I you know I don't deny in a kind of a corrosive impact of it and I [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2920.7799999999997s)]
*  would just say like I've said this before like working in government is very hard [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2928.54s)]
*  so it can make you hard and make you like less of a good person maybe not [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2932.54s)]
*  good person but less of a patient person over the course of your time and like [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2937.38s)]
*  part of getting out of government is about replenishing your intellectual [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2942.14s)]
*  reservoir but part of it is about like restoring your soul which you know of [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2945.2599999999998s)]
*  just being a decent nice friendly don't be a jerk right I tried not to be in [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2951.02s)]
*  government but like you just get there's a lot of pressure in that job in terms [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2956.58s)]
*  of policy process I would just say the most interesting thing about my four [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2963.18s)]
*  years in the sea was we had a huge number of crises and challenges but also [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2969.66s)]
*  we had this incredibly interdisciplinary foreign policy and national security [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2972.7799999999997s)]
*  semiconductor export controls a global infrastructure initiative you know the [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2976.98s)]
*  industrial strategy that we were innovating and pioneering and putting [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2983.38s)]
*  into action that just required a different group of people around the [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2986.9s)]
*  table than you historically have so you know the role of the Commerce Department [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2990.3s)]
*  the role of the Development Finance Corporation a lot of voices who you'd be [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=2996.78s)]
*  bringing forward to play a critical role on central national security issues who [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3001.94s)]
*  historically didn't have as amplified a voice that was a big part of what I [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3006.58s)]
*  tried to bring to the table and what I tried to do at the NSA was build the [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3010.22s)]
*  capacity for that a new directorate on technology and national security you know [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3013.2999999999997s)]
*  a whole new kind of muscle around global infrastructure build out supply chain [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3017.98s)]
*  resilience these kinds of things that weren't really a part of the [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3024.02s)]
*  conversation before but it becomes central now and that just means [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3026.62s)]
*  coordination is so much more important today than it even was 20 years ago and [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3029.8999999999996s)]
*  that's why the basic dismantlement of the NSC is so bizarre to me because I [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3034.06s)]
*  think it is more crucial we need that very badly and then finally in terms of [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3038.22s)]
*  a piece of advice you know I clerked for Justice Breyer at Supreme Court and he [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3042.2999999999997s)]
*  had a huge impact on me in terms of being open-minded and willing to take [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3048.3399999999997s)]
*  on argument and evidence and change my view and he you know early on I went to [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3053.66s)]
*  see him and I said mr. you know justice I think you should maybe decide the case [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3062.14s)]
*  this way this is my recommendation and he said no no no no no no well maybe [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3068.7799999999997s)]
*  yes that's an argument I agree we should do that and I it was a kind of funny [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3075.8199999999997s)]
*  moment but he had this phrase that's an argument and kind of what he meant was I [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3082.2999999999997s)]
*  hadn't considered that I hadn't thought of that but you're right okay and I [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3087.86s)]
*  really have tried to bring that habit of mine to everything that I do and so you [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3092.78s)]
*  know I tried to run a very flat NSC meaning for big ticket items you don't [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3097.2200000000003s)]
*  just bring in the senior director you bring in the team and you go for it you [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3101.6600000000003s)]
*  hash it out and everybody has a right to speak and express their point of view [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3108.06s)]
*  and there would be days where I'd be like no thank you I disagree and move on [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3113.06s)]
*  but there'd be a lot of days speaking of being impatient but there'd be a lot of [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3118.2599999999998s)]
*  days where I would say you know what actually yes that's right let's go with [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3121.94s)]
*  that and that was often from the most junior person in the room and I think [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3125.46s)]
*  the more you guys do that kind of thing as a habit in your lives whatever role [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3128.66s)]
*  you're in the more effective you will end up being I'm gonna finish because we [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3132.42s)]
*  only have a couple of minutes left but there are two C's that we haven't talked [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3137.98s)]
*  about yet and I want to finish with that there's also a g7 meeting coming up [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3141.02s)]
*  obviously next week in Canada which will be interesting given the backdrop of [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3145.42s)]
*  relationships between the participants climate and China climate is something [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3149.78s)]
*  that has worked its way through a number of multilateral institutions even NATO [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3156.22s)]
*  now has a center on climate it has historically been part of g7 statements [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3161.58s)]
*  and commitments of the major advanced democracies to work together I think [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3168.98s)]
*  it's probably unlikely that there will be a joint statement on climate at the [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3174.18s)]
*  g7 next week how do you think how do you think policy analysts should be looking [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3176.94s)]
*  at what the potential future pathways are for coordination on the climate [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3184.26s)]
*  crisis and then on China do you think the discourse in Washington is too [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3188.38s)]
*  hawkish to dovish to pro engagement to pro confrontation right now and how do [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3196.06s)]
*  you think that'll play out as we try as assumedly the administration tries to [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3204.7799999999997s)]
*  build a coalition around you know on the on the China question I think the [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3209.38s)]
*  discourse on China was a one-way ratchet more and more hawkish with each passing [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3215.34s)]
*  year but somewhere along the way I think it crested to a more responsible kind [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3219.94s)]
*  of conversation not among everybody there are those prominent people who [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3226.02s)]
*  write op-ed saying we must basically crush the CCP and and make China bend [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3230.42s)]
*  the knee let's say by and large the basic formula that there's competition [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3234.82s)]
*  we need to manage it so it doesn't turn into conflict and we need to find areas [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3239.94s)]
*  to work together it's in our mutual interest that basic formula which I [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3243.58s)]
*  think is the right approach to China one can articulate that across Washington [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3247.02s)]
*  and get pretty broad purchase so I I'm not as as concerned about the overall [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3252.5s)]
*  state of play of the China debate in Washington as I might have predicted [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3261.02s)]
*  things would go five years ago or ten years ago that being said I do think [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3265.46s)]
*  there are some areas like this whole question of scrutinizing to the you know [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3270.54s)]
*  basically trying to reduce by a dramatic amount the number of Chinese students [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3276.58s)]
*  and researchers in the United States I think it's a complete own goal and is not [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3279.98s)]
*  in our national security interests of course we should look for vetting you [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3283.98s)]
*  know vetting cases of espionage and so forth but it kind of stated goal of [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3288.54s)]
*  driving away talent from our shores is totally antithetical I think to an [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3292.62s)]
*  effective foreign policy on climate I wish I had better news to report but I [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3297.26s)]
*  think the first Trump term has given us a window into what the second Trump term [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3301.3s)]
*  will be which is essentially an abandonment of any kind of role on [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3307.5s)]
*  leadership when it comes to the climate crisis and so will be left to others the [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3312.3s)]
*  good news is in the first term a lot of others stepped up state local [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3316.42s)]
*  nonprofit some private sector I want to see that again but I also think it needs [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3321.86s)]
*  to rekindle a debate about what comes next because we're going to be even more [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NziSqrot2YY&t=3329.3s)]
