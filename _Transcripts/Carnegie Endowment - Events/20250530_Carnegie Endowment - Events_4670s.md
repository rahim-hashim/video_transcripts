Video Description: The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of African Affairs recently unveiled a commercial diplomacy strategy towards Africa that reframes U.S. foreign policy towards the continent. This six-point plan aims to streamline U.S. diplomatic engagement to focus on activities that increase U.S. exports and investment in Africa, eliminate trade deficits, and drive mutual prosperity.
Concurrently, the Trump administration has announced plans to host a U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit later this year. To learn more about the new commercial diplomacy strategy and the upcoming summit, the Carnegie Africa Program will host a fireside chat with Ambassador Troy Fitrell, senior bureau official at the Bureau of African Affairs at the U.S. Department of State.
Join Dr. Zainab Usman, inaugural director of the Carnegie Africa Program, as she sits down with Ambassador Fitrell to discuss the administration’s evolving strategy toward Africa and the growing role of commercial diplomacy in the future of U.S.-Africa relations.

*  I have ambassadors here I don't want to offend anyone [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  at the Carnegie Endowment Africa program we focus on the economic the political and the transnational issues shaping Africa today and into the future [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=518.1800000000001s)]
*  a key objective of our work is to inform global decision making in international policy to advance the continent's economic development [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=528.18s)]
*  we do this by producing technical analyses on key policy areas such as the energy transition [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=537.18s)]
*  digital technology policy trade and investments [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=544.18s)]
*  in this new era of international affairs [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=548.18s)]
*  we also serve as a bridge for policy dialogues between stakeholders here in DC and in Africa [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=552.18s)]
*  through these twin threads the Carnegie Africa program is playing an explainer role of the seismic policy shifts happening here in DC [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=559.18s)]
*  as they affect the African continent and the wider global south [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=569.18s)]
*  just this year we at the Africa program have leveraged our analytical and our convening capacity [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=575.18s)]
*  to explain the impacts and the opportunities for African countries of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=581.18s)]
*  among others rapid changes in US tariffs and trade policy [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=587.18s)]
*  the evolving role that critical energy transition minerals will play in the US DRC relationship [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=593.18s)]
*  and also the global policy reframe from energy transition to energy security [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=601.18s)]
*  I urge you all to check out our website for these publications [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=607.18s)]
*  with a new administration well not new newish administration in the US White House [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=612.18s)]
*  the policy environment in Washington DC has become very fluid [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=617.18s)]
*  in the first 100 days the Trump administration moved swiftly to implement a far-reaching domestic and international policy agenda [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=623.18s)]
*  in doing so the administration has upended many of the norms that underpin global trade aid and diplomacy [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=633.18s)]
*  it is in a sense a new world that we find ourselves in today [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=642.18s)]
*  from energy diplomacy to trade policy to development assistance and digital technologies [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=647.18s)]
*  prevailing modes of operation that once seemed immutable are changing rapidly [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=653.18s)]
*  there is thus an imperative for organizations like the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=659.18s)]
*  to help global stakeholders better understand this rapidly evolving operating environment [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=665.18s)]
*  we are therefore very proud to welcome Ambassador Troy Fitzgerald here today for a discussion [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=670.18s)]
*  on the US State Department's engagement with Africa and the growing role of commercial diplomacy [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=675.18s)]
*  in the future of US Africa relations [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=681.18s)]
*  speaking of commercial diplomacy I thought to share some numbers with all of you here today [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=685.18s)]
*  two-way trade between the US and Africa in 2024 was less than 80 billion dollars [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=691.18s)]
*  by comparison trade between China and Africa in the same period amounted to a record high of 292 billion dollars [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=697.18s)]
*  the prominence of both the US and China in Africa's trade completely inverted within two decades [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=707.18s)]
*  in 2003 China was the preferred trading partner over the US for only 18 African countries [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=715.18s)]
*  that's 35% of the countries on the continent fast forward to 2023 solidifying itself as a manufacturing and trading behemoth [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=724.18s)]
*  52 African countries that's 97% of the continent trade more with China than with America [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=734.18s)]
*  I thought to share these numbers to underscore the importance of effective commercial diplomacy for Africa's economic future [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=742.18s)]
*  but also for the future of US engagement with the continent [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=750.18s)]
*  the Trump administration is definitely repositioning the US economic relationship with the continent [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=754.18s)]
*  two weeks ago the public was treated to the unveiling of the Bureau of African Affairs new commercial diplomacy strategy [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=760.18s)]
*  and we will hear more about this commercial diplomacy strategy from Ambassador Fitzgerald [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=767.18s)]
*  Furthermore, Ambassador Fitzgerald spoke, and this was in Abidjan, about an upcoming US Africa leader summit to take place later this year [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=775.18s)]
*  this is also something we're going to hear more of today [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=784.18s)]
*  I had some thoughts on the summit already but I think I'll reserve those for our discussion [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=788.18s)]
*  to dive into all of this I want to officially welcome Ambassador Troy Fitzgerald [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=794.18s)]
*  He is a senior Bureau official at the Department of State's Bureau of African Affairs [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=800.18s)]
*  Prior to his current position, Ambassador Fitzgerald served as the US Ambassador to Guinea [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=805.18s)]
*  as the Director of the Offices of West African Affairs and Southern African Affairs [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=811.18s)]
*  and as Deputy Director of the Office of International Security Cooperation in the Bureau of Political and Military Affairs [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=816.18s)]
*  Ambassador Fitzgerald, welcome to the stage [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=823.18s)]
*  A round of applause please [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=825.18s)]
*  Alright, good afternoon everyone, thank you for being here [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=833.18s)]
*  I see a lot of faces I recognize but also many that I don't so thank you all for being here [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=836.18s)]
*  and especially thank you Dr. Zaidhan for your warm welcome and for the Carnegie Endowment for having us here [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=842.18s)]
*  and for having all of these types of things that really further how we discuss issues in Washington [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=848.18s)]
*  and it plays an important role I think, it really feeds into the policy process [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=855.18s)]
*  if you ever wonder where you have influence, I think you have it right here [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=860.18s)]
*  So, wonderful, as many of you have known, as Dr. Zaidhan just told you [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=865.18s)]
*  the Department of State has undertaken a comprehensive shift in how we approach economic engagement on the African continent [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=870.18s)]
*  We recognize that Africa is not only a region of immense potential [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=876.18s)]
*  but let's get past that, we're always talking about how much potential Africa has [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=880.18s)]
*  It's already a key geopolitical and economic actor [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=885.18s)]
*  It's already a critical actor on the world stage [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=889.18s)]
*  and so we're reimagining how diplomacy can be a powerful catalyst for trade, investment and sustainable growth [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=892.18s)]
*  Historically our engagement has leaned heavily on development assistance [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=901.18s)]
*  and with those efforts we have saved lives, we have built infrastructure [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=905.18s)]
*  and brought us to some common understandings [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=910.18s)]
*  as we're now entering a new chapter, one where we emphasize partnerships grounded in mutual economic interest [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=913.18s)]
*  That means leveraging our diplomatic platforms to connect U.S. businesses with African markets [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=920.18s)]
*  advocating for regulatory reforms that enable commerce [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=925.18s)]
*  and working directly with African governments to shape enabling environments for investment [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=929.18s)]
*  Our strategy is simple but it's ambitious [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=933.18s)]
*  Make commercial diplomacy a core focus of our diplomatic engagement [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=936.18s)]
*  That is not rhetoric [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=941.18s)]
*  We are measuring success in real terms by the deals signed, the investments made and the new market access created [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=943.18s)]
*  Just within the past few months, U.S. ambassadors across the continent have helped facilitate more than 30 major commercial deals [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=949.18s)]
*  totaling more than $6 billion [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=956.18s)]
*  And by the way, we put those numbers here in this comment because I said that several weeks ago in Abidjan [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=959.18s)]
*  But this morning I noticed we're at 71 new deals since the advent of the new administration [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=965.18s)]
*  These include infrastructure, clean energy, tech ventures [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=972.18s)]
*  These deliver not only financial returns but also skills development and job creation for African communities [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=977.18s)]
*  One of the biggest concerns we've heard from the U.S. companies is that our government tools [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=983.18s)]
*  financing, project development and trade facilitation have been too fragmented and too slow [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=988.18s)]
*  We need to change that [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=994.18s)]
*  We are pushing for reforms to our export and investment support frameworks [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=996.18s)]
*  so that U.S. firms can better compete with global actors including China and Russia [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=999.18s)]
*  who often bring aggressive financing and state-backed leverage [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1004.18s)]
*  We're also encouraging our development finance institutions to take on more risk [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1007.18s)]
*  because the opportunity is worth it [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1012.18s)]
*  African markets are dynamic, youthful and increasingly digital [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1014.18s)]
*  By 2050, the continent will be home to 2.5 billion people with a projected purchasing power exceeding $16 trillion [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1019.18s)]
*  This rivals the economic output of our three largest current trading partners combined [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1025.1799999999998s)]
*  It matters [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1031.1799999999998s)]
*  And this is not a U.S. only effort [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1033.1799999999998s)]
*  We're working hand-in-hand with African leaders to identify market reforms needed to unlock investment [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1035.1799999999998s)]
*  These include reducing non-tariff barriers, improving contract enforcement and modernizing customs procedures [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1040.18s)]
*  Where those reforms are made, we will spotlight those countries as priority destinations for trade and investment [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1047.18s)]
*  especially at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit that we hope to hold later this year [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1053.18s)]
*  Our goals are not transactional [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1058.18s)]
*  They are transformational [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1061.18s)]
*  Where African governments choose American companies, they aren't just selecting products [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1063.18s)]
*  They're choosing quality, innovation, transportation and long-term value [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1068.18s)]
*  American companies bring with them not only capital, but also training, jobs and community investment [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1073.18s)]
*  That's the American way of doing business [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1079.18s)]
*  We pay taxes, we pay sovereign royalties, we invest in workforces and we don't bring in floods of expatriate workers [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1082.18s)]
*  Visit any American company on the continent and you won't find locals just in labor positions [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1090.18s)]
*  You'll find local technicians, accountants, directors and CEOs [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1095.18s)]
*  We don't have state-owned enterprises that I can simply direct [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1100.18s)]
*  But that is a strength, not a weakness [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1104.18s)]
*  The innovation, the drive and the commitment to true viability in investment [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1107.18s)]
*  These are the key factors for sustainable economic growth [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1111.18s)]
*  And we're committed to widening the bridge of opportunity [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1115.18s)]
*  That means bringing more small and medium-sized American businesses into African markets [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1118.18s)]
*  There are nearly 300,000 export-ready U.S. firms that have never done business on the continent [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1122.18s)]
*  That's a missed opportunity and we aim to correct that through outreach, matchmaking and market intelligence [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1128.18s)]
*  In closing, just let me emphasize [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1134.18s)]
*  The United States sees Africa as a partner in shaping the 21st century global economy [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1137.18s)]
*  We intend to root this partnership in shared prosperity, mutual respect and a clear-eyed recognition of our interconnected futures [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1142.18s)]
*  We're in Africa because it matters [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1149.18s)]
*  And so with that, let's jump into the conversation [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1152.18s)]
*  Thank you [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1154.18s)]
*  Thank you very much, Ambassador Fitzgerald [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1155.18s)]
*  So before we start, I want to walk everyone through our run of show [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1163.18s)]
*  We're going to have a discussion with Ambassador Fitzgerald for about 20 minutes [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1169.18s)]
*  And then we'll open up for Q&A [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1172.18s)]
*  This is something I always like to do [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1175.18s)]
*  All of you are here because you want to engage and we'll definitely give an opportunity for that [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1177.18s)]
*  And then we'll wrap up [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1182.18s)]
*  But before we start, I also want to take this opportunity to recognize the honorable ambassadors in our midst [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1185.18s)]
*  Honorable Ambassador from Cote d'Ivoire, honorable ambassador from Togo, honorable ambassador from Namibia [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1192.18s)]
*  Honorable ambassador from Rwanda, honorable ambassador from Djibouti and also honorable ambassador from Botswana [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1204.18s)]
*  And then we have 14 African diplomatic missions here as well as six European diplomatic missions [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1212.18s)]
*  I don't want to call any country in particular and one Asian diplomatic mission [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1221.18s)]
*  So just something I thought to do [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1226.18s)]
*  So I suppose the first question I want to ask you, Ambassador Fitzgerald, just on this commercial diplomacy strategy you mentioned [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1230.18s)]
*  Is that at the core of commerce is trade, imports and exports [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1242.18s)]
*  Do you have a strategy for trade flows in the opposite direction? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1253.18s)]
*  So you mentioned of course investments and US companies being able to export to the African market [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1259.18s)]
*  But is there a strategy for trade flows in the opposite direction? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1269.18s)]
*  And basically here I'm asking a question about AGOA, the African Growth and Opportunity Act [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1274.18s)]
*  Whose future right now is uncertain [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1280.18s)]
*  When I talk to people they say, I just came back from some African countries and people said, oh AGOA is dead [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1282.18s)]
*  I was like, no, well it's not dead, maybe it's on its deathbed but not dead yet [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1288.18s)]
*  And you know miracles can happen so things you can do on that front [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1293.18s)]
*  And AGOA is probably quite important here or just as a mechanism for facilitating African exports also to the US market [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1298.18s)]
*  And this perhaps in the context of moving the relationship to one you mentioned of mutual prosperity [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1309.18s)]
*  So any thoughts on that? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1315.18s)]
*  Yeah, okay, kind of two questions [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1317.18s)]
*  If you want the AGOA question first we can do it [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1319.18s)]
*  I'm a fan of AGOA, I was working in Africa while we were creating AGOA [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1323.18s)]
*  I was living in Zambia and I was doing economic and commercial work there [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1329.18s)]
*  We were doing the initial creation of AGOA and its immediate implementation [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1332.18s)]
*  But that was 25 years ago and the world was a very different place 25 years ago [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1339.18s)]
*  Africa was a very different continent 25 years ago [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1344.18s)]
*  I'll tell you, the Zambia today is unrecognizable from the Zambia 25 years ago [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1347.18s)]
*  And so I'm a fan of AGOA, I hope that we get some kind of renovation in order to reinstate it [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1352.18s)]
*  It's due to expire later this year but this is a legislative project [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1362.18s)]
*  When my dear colleagues, the ambassadors from the African diplomatic corps asked me about this [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1369.18s)]
*  About what I was doing to get AGOA reauthorized [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1374.18s)]
*  If you may remember, my response was, what are you doing to get AGOA reauthorized? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1377.18s)]
*  I'm not supposed to be lobbying Congress, but you can [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1382.18s)]
*  But if there's going to be a renewal, it's also going to be a renovation [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1385.18s)]
*  The world is vastly different today than it was then [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1390.18s)]
*  And there should be something much more recognizably equivalent in this [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1393.18s)]
*  There should be a general sense of reciprocity in it [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1402.18s)]
*  What we've seen is, the countries in the world that have opened up their own markets [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1405.18s)]
*  Have just done wonderfully long term [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1410.18s)]
*  This is an advantage [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1413.18s)]
*  I know they're hard decisions to make [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1415.18s)]
*  But that kind of reciprocity really does work both ways [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1417.18s)]
*  And does encourage development in both directions [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1422.18s)]
*  So that's where I am on AGOA [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1425.18s)]
*  We'll see, my standard answer when I don't want to answer a question [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1428.18s)]
*  Is to say that the administration is only a few months old [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1433.18s)]
*  That's a good one [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1438.18s)]
*  Give them some time [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1439.18s)]
*  But I think I did answer the question [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1440.18s)]
*  But we're only a few months old [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1442.18s)]
*  And so while I've been in the State Department for 30 years [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1445.18s)]
*  I took on this position on January the 20th [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1448.18s)]
*  And so we're just getting started [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1451.18s)]
*  And there are some policy positions we are yet to take [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1455.18s)]
*  And so I've been arguing what I feel is the future of our bilateral trade relationship [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1459.18s)]
*  And we'll see what happens when all the other entities get involved [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1465.18s)]
*  Now, the other part of the question was about simply engaging in trade [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1469.18s)]
*  There are a lot of aspects that matter [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1475.18s)]
*  What I found is some of the greatest [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1478.18s)]
*  Encouraging African businesses is incredibly useful for anyone who's interested in a proper business [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1481.18s)]
*  At the CEO forum in Abidjan a couple weeks ago [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1487.18s)]
*  We talked to wonderful companies who were saying [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1491.18s)]
*  Okay, this company is only 15 years old [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1494.18s)]
*  And it's doing a billion dollars a year in business in Africa [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1496.18s)]
*  But it's also doing 600 million outside of Africa [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1500.18s)]
*  You realize that there's actually a tremendous amount of force and vitality within the continent [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1503.18s)]
*  That's there if we can get it open [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1509.18s)]
*  So this is when we talk about improving the business environment and opening market access [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1513.18s)]
*  Yes, I want access for the American companies [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1518.18s)]
*  But this will also help the African companies operate [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1521.18s)]
*  We say that there is an African free trade agreement [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1524.18s)]
*  And we have an institution set up in Accra for it [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1528.18s)]
*  But if you go stand at a border, at a land border [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1530.18s)]
*  And see the customs issues and the migration issues that you're facing [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1534.18s)]
*  You realize that implementation is the hard part [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1539.18s)]
*  And so creating a better business environment is what will work for both sides [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1542.18s)]
*  And that's what we're really after in that component of our strategy [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1548.18s)]
*  Okay, thank you for that [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1553.18s)]
*  I want to move on to another pressing question that I'm sure is on the minds of a number of people here [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1556.18s)]
*  I wonder if you could speak to the role of other US federal bureaus, departments, agencies in this commercial strategy [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1562.18s)]
*  And specifically given massive reductions in workforce [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1574.18s)]
*  But maybe even anticipated reductions in embassy staffing across the continent [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1581.18s)]
*  Coupled with the shuttering of tools, whether it's a Prosper Africa USAID [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1588.18s)]
*  And then possible reorganization maybe even shuttering or collapsing of MCC into other entities like the DFC [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1596.18s)]
*  So there's just basically describing a landscape here that is changing rapidly [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1605.18s)]
*  How are you thinking about basically interagency coordination? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1611.18s)]
*  At the end of the day, the State Department handles diplomacy [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1617.18s)]
*  There are certain aspects of implementation that might be better suited [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1622.18s)]
*  Or that might be more effective when there is more interagency coordination [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1629.18s)]
*  It's funny you should say that the State Department handles foreign policy, I think you just said [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1635.18s)]
*  Diplomacy [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1640.18s)]
*  I'd say the State Department handles relationships [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1642.18s)]
*  And our ambassadors are not chiefs of the State Department [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1645.18s)]
*  They're chiefs of the entire federal government [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1648.18s)]
*  And so we've always said that commerce and trade advocacy is a priority [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1650.18s)]
*  But we also said about 25 or 30 other things were priorities [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1655.18s)]
*  And they all tend to get lost together [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1658.18s)]
*  I think one of the reasons behind the strategy that we frankly imposed [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1661.18s)]
*  Was that no, this is up at the top [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1669.18s)]
*  This is the priority [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1672.18s)]
*  It is the responsibility of the ambassador to lead their country teams on this [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1674.18s)]
*  It is the role of everyone in the embassy to be cognizant of this as the priority [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1678.18s)]
*  And to be driving on this [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1685.18s)]
*  We've always said it was important [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1687.18s)]
*  Now we have to judge people on how they do in that regard [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1689.18s)]
*  Because people respond to incentives [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1692.18s)]
*  And if there was never really an incentive before to do this, now there is [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1695.18s)]
*  Because let's be honest, foreign service officers only care about two things [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1699.18s)]
*  And that's promotions and assignments [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1703.18s)]
*  And if we link those to their success in commercial advocacy [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1705.18s)]
*  We'll get more commercial advocacy [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1709.18s)]
*  Hence the 71 new projects since January the 20th [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1711.18s)]
*  So we link that [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1715.18s)]
*  Now you talk about the idea of interagency coordination [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1717.18s)]
*  When I came in in that first week [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1723.18s)]
*  And we started a blue-sky look at what are we doing badly [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1725.18s)]
*  What can we do better to do economic growth and commercial advocacy [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1730.18s)]
*  And we did not limit it just to the Africa Bureau or even just to the State Department [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1735.18s)]
*  We said, look, what is the US government, what could we do better [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1740.18s)]
*  And so we looked at all of that [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1743.18s)]
*  And that meant we were sticking our nose in where it really didn't belong [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1745.18s)]
*  And our colleagues at EdCommerce and DFC and ExSim were wondering why we were doing [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1748.18s)]
*  But the actual plan that we came up with was so well received [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1755.18s)]
*  They jumped on board on that [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1760.18s)]
*  And when you specifically talk about [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1763.18s)]
*  We weren't doing this because we dislike the foreign commercial service [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1765.18s)]
*  We were doing it because we love the foreign commercial service [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1769.18s)]
*  We need more of that [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1773.18s)]
*  We need that spread around [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1774.18s)]
*  But it can't just be one person in the embassy's task either [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1775.18s)]
*  It needs to be the team approach that you're referring to [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1778.18s)]
*  So here in Washington, in particular, DFC, ExSim, and the Department of Commerce [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1782.18s)]
*  We keep together on a regular basis [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1789.18s)]
*  Several of you, when you've had your delegations come into the State Department [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1792.18s)]
*  When you come to my office, you see all four of us [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1796.18s)]
*  Because we want there to be no difference in what you're hearing when you travel around Washington [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1799.18s)]
*  It also makes it easier so you only have to have one meeting instead of four [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1804.18s)]
*  But when your ministers come from your countries [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1807.18s)]
*  And your presidents and your vice presidents [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1810.18s)]
*  We have them meet as a team [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1812.18s)]
*  In our embassies, we call that our deal team [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1814.18s)]
*  And that's when all the people relevant to the issue at stake meet together [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1817.18s)]
*  To make sure commercial advocacy happens [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1821.18s)]
*  But we've copied that in Washington [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1824.18s)]
*  And we found it to be extraordinarily effective [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1826.18s)]
*  It means we all own it [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1828.18s)]
*  The Department of Commerce has some wonderful prospects [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1831.18s)]
*  With their commercial engagement partnerships [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1835.18s)]
*  But they're not everywhere on the continent [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1838.18s)]
*  And even where they are, it's not just left to them [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1841.18s)]
*  The ambassador needs to lead it [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1845.18s)]
*  Everyone needs to be involved [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1847.18s)]
*  It needs to be a priority [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1849.18s)]
*  And so far in this administration, it is [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1851.18s)]
*  Great. Very, very insightful [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1854.18s)]
*  Thank you for that [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1858.18s)]
*  I now want to move to the US Africa upcoming summit [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1860.18s)]
*  Is it a business summit? Is it a leader summit? Or both? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1865.18s)]
*  Can you just tell us a little bit more about it? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1868.18s)]
*  Starting with the CAVEA [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1871.18s)]
*  The administration is only a few months old [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1873.18s)]
*  I have submitted my recommendation of what we should do [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1875.18s)]
*  And I'm waiting optimistically [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1881.18s)]
*  And I think it will be improved [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1883.18s)]
*  But that's how we're going to do it [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1885.18s)]
*  That we are going to have an Africa leader summit [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1887.18s)]
*  Is just fact. That is happening [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1890.18s)]
*  So I'm recommending that it be in September [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1893.18s)]
*  Roughly alongside of the UN General Assembly [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1896.18s)]
*  Just because so many of the leaders are already here [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1900.18s)]
*  And it makes it easier for everyone to gather in that regard [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1902.18s)]
*  And it will be almost entirely focused on economic growth [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1906.18s)]
*  In all of its facets [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1913.18s)]
*  For me, of course, that's commercial advocacy [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1915.18s)]
*  But it's also stressing what we can do for market advocacy [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1918.18s)]
*  And ease of doing business [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1922.18s)]
*  And one of the things we've been telling our partners [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1925.18s)]
*  In our partner governments across the African continent [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1929.18s)]
*  Was have a couple of major deals [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1932.18s)]
*  Use this as an action forcing event [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1935.18s)]
*  But also look at some of those market reforms [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1938.18s)]
*  Showing that you're serious yourself about sustainable economic growth [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1940.18s)]
*  And we will highlight those at the summit [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1944.18s)]
*  And so that's part of the intention [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1948.18s)]
*  Using it as an action forcing event [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1950.18s)]
*  But almost entirely dedicated to economic growth [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1952.18s)]
*  Sustainable economic growth and commercial advocacy [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1957.18s)]
*  And private, public sector private sector partnerships [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1960.18s)]
*  So maybe September for the summit maybe [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1964.18s)]
*  That's your recommendation [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1967.18s)]
*  That's what I think is going to happen [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1969.18s)]
*  But until I get that signature [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1971.18s)]
*  Okay [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1973.18s)]
*  I know there are questions on that [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1975.18s)]
*  But I will just move on to this [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1977.18s)]
*  I know we have a few more minutes before we open up [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1979.18s)]
*  The next question has to do with [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1981.18s)]
*  I suppose the Lobito corridor project [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1985.18s)]
*  So in December, here at the Africa program at Carnegie [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1988.18s)]
*  We put together this compendium of chapters [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1993.18s)]
*  With all of the scholars and the staff and the program [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=1998.18s)]
*  I have to kind of sell stuff here [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2001.18s)]
*  But no, but on a serious note [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2006.18s)]
*  It's on how we think the administration can focus on [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2009.18s)]
*  Strengthening the economic relationship with Africa [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2013.18s)]
*  As you know, a major focus of our work is foreign policy [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2016.18s)]
*  Through the lens of economic development as it relates to Africa [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2020.18s)]
*  And chapter three here is a chapter on the Lobito corridor and beyond [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2024.18s)]
*  Mobilizing US investments in Africa's critical minerals [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2030.18s)]
*  We make a couple of recommendations there [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2036.18s)]
*  And the good thing is each chapter is like three pages long [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2038.18s)]
*  So it's not too long [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2041.18s)]
*  We know this is for policymakers [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2042.18s)]
*  People don't have time to read lengthy documents [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2044.18s)]
*  And I want to highlight two recommendations we make here [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2048.1800000000003s)]
*  Because that's going to be part of the question that I ask you [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2052.18s)]
*  One is that when it comes to the Lobito corridor project [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2054.18s)]
*  My sense and speaking to a lot of experts [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2058.18s)]
*  But also people on the ground in a lot of countries is [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2061.18s)]
*  It's great that the US is finally in the infrastructure business in Africa [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2064.18s)]
*  But it cannot be an extractive project of [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2068.18s)]
*  Africa has this history with the rest of the world where its minerals [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2072.18s)]
*  Have been extracted for centuries actually [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2076.18s)]
*  So there needs to be processing, refining, manufacturing of those minerals [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2080.18s)]
*  And we make that case that maybe this is how to consider [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2085.18s)]
*  Branding the Lobito corridor project in this administration [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2090.18s)]
*  And the second recommendation we make is that maybe there needs to be a second corridor project [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2094.18s)]
*  But this time in West Africa [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2099.18s)]
*  Or a third and fourth and fifth [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2101.18s)]
*  Yes, agreed [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2103.18s)]
*  So based on those two points [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2104.18s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen to the Lobito corridor project? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2109.18s)]
*  First off, we're all in on Lobito, 100% [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2112.18s)]
*  My goal is to see rail make it all the way to Kowhazy [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2115.18s)]
*  There are a couple different routes, both of which are viable [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2120.18s)]
*  They're not mutually exclusive [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2123.18s)]
*  But we are all in on Lobito [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2125.18s)]
*  And we're already seeing the benefits [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2127.18s)]
*  And how it generates further economic activity [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2129.18s)]
*  Outside of the transport and mining sectors [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2133.18s)]
*  And that's the intention [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2136.18s)]
*  So first let me get back to one of the [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2138.18s)]
*  Sort of the undercurrents of one of the questions you had [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2141.18s)]
*  And of course I'm going to use a Guinea example because that's where I spent the last three years [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2144.18s)]
*  If 80% of your country's foreign [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2148.18s)]
*  You know cash receipts come from the mining sector [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2152.18s)]
*  But 80% of your population works in agriculture [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2155.18s)]
*  Then you have this fundamental disconnect between the people of the country and the economy [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2158.18s)]
*  And that is not sustainable [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2163.18s)]
*  There is no future for a country like that [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2166.18s)]
*  That doesn't include agriculture [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2169.18s)]
*  Now, you're not going to be able to build [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2171.18s)]
*  At a million dollars a kilometer [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2174.18s)]
*  A railroad just to support the agriculture sector [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2178.18s)]
*  But if you can build that railroad for the large extractive industries [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2181.18s)]
*  Such that the railroad is available for the other forms of commercial engagement [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2185.18s)]
*  Then you've got some really interesting opportunities [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2191.18s)]
*  Same thing with power [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2195.18s)]
*  You talk about the refining and the value added [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2197.18s)]
*  Every mining license and mining concession in Guinea's history [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2200.18s)]
*  Has required that they process bauxite into Illumina there on site [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2205.18s)]
*  And for 70 years no one's really done it [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2211.18s)]
*  Because they all had the same argument [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2215.18s)]
*  That we don't have the power [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2217.18s)]
*  The power grid will not support this [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2218.18s)]
*  Therefore we have to just export the raw bauxite [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2220.18s)]
*  One, for having American companies involved [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2223.18s)]
*  We've actually solved that problem [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2226.18s)]
*  By an LNG project that we got ratified just about six months ago [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2228.18s)]
*  So now suddenly the mining companies are being told [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2233.18s)]
*  You have to live up to that thing that you've been promising you would do [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2237.18s)]
*  If you ever got power [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2241.18s)]
*  So now we are seeing the construction of refineries [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2242.18s)]
*  But it just makes sense [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2245.18s)]
*  When you have the business environment ready [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2248.18s)]
*  Then you can do this [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2250.18s)]
*  But you have to get that infrastructure part correct [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2252.18s)]
*  Let me go back to the agriculture again [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2254.18s)]
*  In central Guinea you have massive poultry operations [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2257.18s)]
*  But if you go to a supermarket in Conakry [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2263.18s)]
*  They're importing eggs from Spain [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2266.18s)]
*  There are eggs just 100 kilometers away [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2268.18s)]
*  But if you try to bring them in [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2272.18s)]
*  They'll all be broken because of the state of the roads [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2274.18s)]
*  It's really that simple sometimes [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2276.18s)]
*  To just get the infrastructure right [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2279.18s)]
*  And so the paving of the roads right now [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2281.18s)]
*  We're expecting to have a huge boom in agricultural production in central Guinea [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2283.18s)]
*  It's not going to make any newspaper headlines [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2289.18s)]
*  Because everyone's always talking about iron and bauxite [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2292.18s)]
*  But it really matters [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2294.18s)]
*  And that's where that infrastructure can come [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2296.18s)]
*  So for me the Lubita corridor [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2298.18s)]
*  You already see the vitality that's coming through it [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2301.18s)]
*  When you see the railroad starts running their trains [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2304.18s)]
*  The very first locomotive, an American-made locomotive I will have you note [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2307.18s)]
*  Was just commissioned for the new railway in Guinea [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2311.18s)]
*  You get this [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2317.18s)]
*  Wabtec locomotives, the old General Electric [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2318.18s)]
*  98% of all the locomotives they've ever built are still operating [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2321.18s)]
*  You don't see that with anything made anywhere else [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2326.18s)]
*  So when you look at initial costs [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2329.18s)]
*  You have to look at life cycle costs [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2331.18s)]
*  And these things matter [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2333.18s)]
*  But that kind of engagement [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2334.18s)]
*  So where should we do Lubita again? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2336.18s)]
*  Because as I say it's a model [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2339.18s)]
*  A model that's worked spectacularly [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2341.18s)]
*  And one that we should copy elsewhere [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2344.18s)]
*  I personally think we should be getting rail all the way out to the Malian border [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2347.18s)]
*  To Sighiri through Guinea [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2350.18s)]
*  But also with eyes on Bamako after that [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2352.18s)]
*  Honestly, Malini needs to have a calmer political and security situation before that's viable [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2356.18s)]
*  But getting to the border in the first place [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2363.18s)]
*  I would also seek running up through the length of Cote d'Ivoire would matter [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2365.18s)]
*  And then connecting across [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2368.18s)]
*  West Africa needs integrated infrastructure [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2370.18s)]
*  I can tell you the interconnectors for the electrical grid [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2375.18s)]
*  Between Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2380.18s)]
*  Near the town of Nzerekore [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2383.18s)]
*  And between Guinea and Senegal [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2385.18s)]
*  Near the town of Labé [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2388.18s)]
*  Both occurred during the last three years [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2390.18s)]
*  And the difference in those two cities [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2392.18s)]
*  After they were connected to reliable power [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2395.18s)]
*  Was phenomenal [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2397.18s)]
*  And what we saw was not just that [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2398.18s)]
*  Oh now we buy power from Senegal or Cote d'Ivoire [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2400.18s)]
*  But during the rainy season [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2404.18s)]
*  When the reservoirs were full and Guinea had excess power [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2406.18s)]
*  They were selling power back the other way [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2409.18s)]
*  Infrastructure needs to be regionalized [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2412.18s)]
*  And that's the kind of big ticket item [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2415.18s)]
*  That projects like Lobito matter [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2417.18s)]
*  And the nice thing we see on there is [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2421.18s)]
*  It's not supposed to just be DFC come in and finance a project in its entirety [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2423.18s)]
*  But if DFC comes in and takes an equity stake or puts an initial fund in [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2427.18s)]
*  Just having the US government participation automatically de-risks it [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2431.18s)]
*  And allows for private capital to come flowing in [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2436.18s)]
*  And we saw that in abundance [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2439.18s)]
*  And we still see it today with Lobito [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2441.18s)]
*  And I think that will be seen everywhere else as well [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2444.18s)]
*  Blended finance matters [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2446.18s)]
*  It doesn't need to be a single point project [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2448.18s)]
*  Fascinating [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2451.18s)]
*  No, no, no, that's absolutely fascinating [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2453.18s)]
*  I mean you were also ambassador of [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2455.18s)]
*  US ambassador to Guinea [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2457.18s)]
*  So you know the intricacies of what we're discussing here [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2460.18s)]
*  And that's amazing [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2464.18s)]
*  So I want to open up now for Q&A [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2466.18s)]
*  We have maybe about 30 [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2468.18s)]
*  25 minutes or so [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2470.18s)]
*  We will take questions in batches [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2472.18s)]
*  If you could first introduce yourself [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2475.18s)]
*  And then ask your question [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2477.18s)]
*  Please make the question very concise [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2479.18s)]
*  So that we can take as many as possible [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2481.18s)]
*  But before we open up [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2483.18s)]
*  I want to give our honorable ambassadors a chance to weigh in on what they've heard [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2485.18s)]
*  I know some of them would like to speak [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2489.18s)]
*  Tell me where I'm wrong [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2491.18s)]
*  Thank you so much [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2495.18s)]
*  I'm Mathilde, ambassador of Rwanda [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2496.18s)]
*  And thank you so much for what you did [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2498.18s)]
*  Thank you Dr. Znaab for giving us again the opportunity to come and discuss [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2501.18s)]
*  This thing at Carnegie [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2506.18s)]
*  You do a great job, so thank you [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2508.18s)]
*  So [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2510.18s)]
*  Ambassador [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2512.18s)]
*  It's a question [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2514.18s)]
*  I'm not weighing in on anything [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2515.18s)]
*  Because you are always great [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2517.18s)]
*  You come and brief us [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2519.18s)]
*  You do many things [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2521.18s)]
*  But I'm just going to make my question very brief [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2522.18s)]
*  You have been on the continent [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2525.18s)]
*  And you've really worked there [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2527.18s)]
*  And you sometimes call you the African ambassador [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2529.18s)]
*  Because you have been [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2533.18s)]
*  And you also understand [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2535.18s)]
*  You were talking about [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2537.18s)]
*  The lack of trade [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2539.18s)]
*  Between Africa and the continent and the south [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2541.18s)]
*  There are two questions [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2545.18s)]
*  There's one question but with two parts of it [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2546.18s)]
*  One is [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2549.18s)]
*  In the past what happens is that [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2551.18s)]
*  To do business with Africa and other countries [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2553.18s)]
*  Not just one [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2557.18s)]
*  There were more political considerations than economic ones [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2558.18s)]
*  No matter what you do [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2562.18s)]
*  You'll find people for instance who have been [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2564.18s)]
*  Rejected from MCC [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2568.18s)]
*  Not because they can't do business [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2571.18s)]
*  But they are political considerations [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2573.18s)]
*  That sometimes are defined [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2575.18s)]
*  We don't even know how they are defined [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2578.18s)]
*  The second one [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2580.18s)]
*  There are many countries that were ejected from AGOA [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2582.18s)]
*  From Africa [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2585.18s)]
*  So that's the second thing [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2586.18s)]
*  It was not because they couldn't do business [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2588.18s)]
*  It was because of political considerations [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2590.18s)]
*  So it gets me to this question again [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2593.18s)]
*  Number one [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2596.18s)]
*  Because of that low thing [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2598.18s)]
*  It's because we are seen as risky for business [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2600.18s)]
*  What are the steps we could take to de-risk the continent [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2604.18s)]
*  Because obviously in general [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2608.18s)]
*  The riches of Africa are being used [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2613.18s)]
*  But when it comes to legitimate trade we are risky [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2616.18s)]
*  Why are we risky? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2620.18s)]
*  So how do we start to de-risk the continent [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2621.18s)]
*  That you can really come and do the business [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2625.18s)]
*  And we are able to be doing this [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2628.18s)]
*  Because that's a very [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2630.18s)]
*  It's a question that is out there [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2632.18s)]
*  And so what are the steps we should be taking? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2634.18s)]
*  And where if I'm coming to do business with ABCD [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2637.18s)]
*  I have technology [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2641.18s)]
*  But then tomorrow you say [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2643.18s)]
*  But there's a little bit of a consideration [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2645.18s)]
*  In the political landscape we need to solve [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2647.18s)]
*  So those are the questions I would really like for you to weigh on [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2650.18s)]
*  And we are happy to see that people are really focusing on business [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2655.18s)]
*  But where do we begin? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2660.18s)]
*  To be able to say bring my business here [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2663.18s)]
*  And I bring your business here [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2666.18s)]
*  Thank you so much [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2668.18s)]
*  Thank you Ambassador [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2670.18s)]
*  Before you address that if any other Ambassador [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2671.18s)]
*  So we can take them in a batch [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2674.18s)]
*  Thank you very much Dr. Zainab [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2676.18s)]
*  Thank you very much Ambassador Trailerz [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2679.18s)]
*  It's lovely to be here and good afternoon [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2682.18s)]
*  My name is Margaret Mensah Williams [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2685.18s)]
*  The Ambassador of Namibia [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2687.18s)]
*  And some other countries [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2689.18s)]
*  Some other countries representing some other countries [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2694.18s)]
*  Where we are [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2697.18s)]
*  I'm grateful for this very insightful [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2698.18s)]
*  And informative discussion [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2702.18s)]
*  You have also enlightened a bit [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2704.18s)]
*  You know the audience on some of the insights [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2707.18s)]
*  Of what can happen [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2710.18s)]
*  I am also very happy for your always very analytic way [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2712.18s)]
*  Of placing questions on our behalf also [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2716.18s)]
*  And for the research you are doing [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2719.18s)]
*  And for the information you're sharing [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2721.18s)]
*  Likewise Ambassador [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2724.18s)]
*  With what my sister and co-Ambassador just asked [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2726.18s)]
*  At the moment [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2731.18s)]
*  And it's great [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2733.18s)]
*  Our new President have also now added trade [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2735.18s)]
*  To our Ministry of International Relations [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2738.18s)]
*  Which is the Foreign Ministry [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2741.18s)]
*  So commerce and redefining how we should operate [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2743.18s)]
*  In the political atmosphere that we have [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2750.18s)]
*  But I'm also happy that you say [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2754.18s)]
*  It's not only transactional [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2756.18s)]
*  It is transformative [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2759.18s)]
*  And we also want that transition [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2761.18s)]
*  From being aid institutions as countries [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2764.18s)]
*  And from being countries where our resources are tapped [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2769.18s)]
*  But there's no beneficiation at the end of the day [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2774.18s)]
*  We would also like to understand [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2778.18s)]
*  As it is with the current situation of tariffs [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2781.18s)]
*  We have a problem with possible investors [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2785.18s)]
*  To our country and from our country [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2789.18s)]
*  To do exactly what the current administration want us to do [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2792.18s)]
*  And they are saying [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2797.18s)]
*  You know they have a wait and see attitude [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2799.18s)]
*  They don't want to engage us [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2801.18s)]
*  They don't want to move forward [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2803.18s)]
*  They want to wait and see [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2805.18s)]
*  And in the interest of time to give others also some chance [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2806.18s)]
*  I will end there [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2809.18s)]
*  Thank you so much [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2810.18s)]
*  Thank you very much Ambassador [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2811.18s)]
*  Any other? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2813.18s)]
*  Thank you [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2814.18s)]
*  Mine is a very short one [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2816.18s)]
*  My name is Ambassador Muputin from Botswana [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2818.18s)]
*  I normally like the concept of Thomas Friedman [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2821.18s)]
*  When he talks about the golden straight jacket [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2827.18s)]
*  And he talks about the fast moving train [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2829.18s)]
*  I just wanted to find out as we transition from aid to the partnership [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2832.18s)]
*  In terms of commerce [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2839.18s)]
*  And understanding how Africa has been a little bit behind [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2841.18s)]
*  When you look with the rest of the continents [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2845.18s)]
*  Your strategy, what does it actually say to ensure that [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2848.18s)]
*  We don't all fit into the design golden straight jacket [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2853.18s)]
*  Or that fast moving train [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2860.18s)]
*  Without necessarily giving aid or spoiling us [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2862.18s)]
*  But to ensure that we catch up with the rest of the world [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2866.18s)]
*  Thank you [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2870.18s)]
*  Okay [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2871.18s)]
*  Okay [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2872.18s)]
*  Alright [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2873.18s)]
*  We have three questions for you [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2874.18s)]
*  Sure [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2876.18s)]
*  We'll open them and then we'll open up [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2877.18s)]
*  A whole bunch of questions in there [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2878.18s)]
*  Let me just run down [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2880.18s)]
*  That's why I started taking notes [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2881.18s)]
*  Because the last time I [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2882.18s)]
*  Especially when I engaged with the African Diplomatic Corps [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2883.18s)]
*  I got so many questions that by the time I started answering [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2886.18s)]
*  I started forgetting them [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2889.18s)]
*  So I was writing down [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2890.18s)]
*  As far as I'm to do business in Africa [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2891.18s)]
*  You have to really mean it [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2893.18s)]
*  You can't just drop in and expect something to happen [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2895.18s)]
*  You have to build relationships [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2898.18s)]
*  And that's one of the things I'm always telling prospective investors [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2899.18s)]
*  And I'm on the other side and receiving them [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2904.18s)]
*  You have to really mean it [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2907.18s)]
*  You need to make sure you're here for the long term [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2908.18s)]
*  You have to make sure that you are engaged [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2910.18s)]
*  And you have the right relationships [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2912.18s)]
*  And so in doing that [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2915.18s)]
*  You talk about the political considerations that they came in [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2917.18s)]
*  And you mentioned MCC and AGOA [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2920.18s)]
*  Look, both of those are things that were just tremendous [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2922.18s)]
*  Just gifts straight out [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2927.18s)]
*  MCC was we are just going to come in and pay for a massive amount of infrastructure [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2928.18s)]
*  But in a lot of cases we did that through open tenders and things [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2933.18s)]
*  And they weren't necessarily going to US companies [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2938.18s)]
*  It was just here we're going to come build something for you [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2940.18s)]
*  It's nice [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2943.18s)]
*  I think everybody liked getting MCC in that regard [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2945.18s)]
*  But there was no relationship there [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2949.18s)]
*  It was just we're coming in to build a thing [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2951.18s)]
*  AGOA, the vast majority of the continent does engage with AGOA [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2954.18s)]
*  But we did say you had to have an elected government [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2960.18s)]
*  I mean to get it through, because it's a law [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2963.18s)]
*  To get it through our Congress [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2966.18s)]
*  It had to be this is for the countries that are trying to do things the right way [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2968.18s)]
*  And the vast majority of African countries are qualified for AGOA [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2973.18s)]
*  And when you look at the few that aren't [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2977.18s)]
*  One might suggest that their problems are not because they're not in AGOA [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2980.18s)]
*  Their problems are because of how they're governing their own countries [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2984.18s)]
*  And that's been an issue [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2988.18s)]
*  But the countries that have truly benefited from AGOA [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2990.18s)]
*  Have been doing so dramatically [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2993.18s)]
*  Because of how they took their approach to business [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=2995.18s)]
*  I mean when you were saying that though it reminded me of [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3001.18s)]
*  In the 1970s the poorest country in Africa was Mauritius [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3005.18s)]
*  And now it's the wealthiest country in Africa [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3009.18s)]
*  But in the 1970s everyone said oh it's not fair, poor Mauritius [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3013.18s)]
*  They're a little island and they're out in the middle of the ocean [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3017.18s)]
*  They don't have any scale economies [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3020.18s)]
*  It's difficult to, you know, logistics to be there [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3023.18s)]
*  It's not their fault [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3026.18s)]
*  But they opened up their economy, boomed [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3028.18s)]
*  And now they're the wealthiest country in Africa [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3031.18s)]
*  I would dare say Botswana's done some similar things [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3033.18s)]
*  There are a number of countries [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3036.18s)]
*  Just in the last 15 years the change of Benin [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3038.18s)]
*  And its economic growth [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3042.18s)]
*  These things happen through governance [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3046.18s)]
*  And so trying to make that happen [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3048.18s)]
*  Is one of the reasons why we had AGOA [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3050.18s)]
*  Was to try to encourage that kind of change [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3053.18s)]
*  It's what MCC was for [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3055.18s)]
*  It was for the countries that were doing everything right [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3057.18s)]
*  But we wanted to give an additional catalyst [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3060.18s)]
*  An additional jump start [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3063.18s)]
*  And that's where that came [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3064.18s)]
*  But certainly nobody was entitled to a $500 million project [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3066.18s)]
*  It was you're doing great things in your country [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3070.18s)]
*  Let us see what we can help on that [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3073.18s)]
*  Now we talk about how to de-risk [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3076.18s)]
*  How to de-risk [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3078.18s)]
*  That was one of the reasons why some of our engagement [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3079.18s)]
*  We have projects where they say we don't even necessarily want any finance [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3083.18s)]
*  We're good, we're either self-financed or we've already arranged it [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3087.18s)]
*  But we still want some EXIM or some DFC financing [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3090.18s)]
*  Because we want that U.S. government engagement [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3093.18s)]
*  Just to help get it off the ground [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3097.18s)]
*  Just to help demonstrate to our shareholders, to financiers [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3099.18s)]
*  That we're serious because we've got the U.S. government in there [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3102.18s)]
*  I know of two major investors recently who paid off their loans early [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3105.18s)]
*  Because they didn't need them [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3111.18s)]
*  They just wanted them to get the project off the ground [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3112.18s)]
*  And so that was good [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3115.18s)]
*  I can tell you when it comes also to de-risking [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3116.18s)]
*  Some of it is just who judges risk? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3118.18s)]
*  Rating agencies judge risk [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3121.18s)]
*  So I had several rating agencies come visit me in Guinea [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3123.18s)]
*  And I took them around [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3128.18s)]
*  Because don't just believe what you read or on the Internet [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3129.18s)]
*  Come see the place and take a look at this [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3132.18s)]
*  I would suggest if you think you've got a good story to tell [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3136.18s)]
*  Get Moody's and the others to come in and see your country [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3139.18s)]
*  And see what the risk really is [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3142.18s)]
*  Now be careful [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3144.18s)]
*  If they're going to come and find out that it's worse than they think [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3145.18s)]
*  You might regret that [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3148.18s)]
*  But if you've got a story to tell [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3150.18s)]
*  And I know you do [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3152.18s)]
*  Invite them in and let them see it [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3154.18s)]
*  A lot of international investment [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3156.18s)]
*  We have something like $27 trillion held up in the U.S. capital market [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3158.18s)]
*  In pension funds and the like [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3163.18s)]
*  Almost all of it is invested automatically [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3165.18s)]
*  Basically by bots [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3168.18s)]
*  They plug into what meets certain criteria that are available online [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3170.18s)]
*  There's no person thinking about it [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3175.18s)]
*  Getting people to think about Africa and recognize the opportunities [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3178.18s)]
*  Those are the ones [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3183.18s)]
*  That's what we're trying to get [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3184.18s)]
*  And that's what we're engaging with [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3186.18s)]
*  So engage with these sorts of people [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3187.18s)]
*  It really matters [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3189.18s)]
*  I'll tell you when I lived in Mauritius [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3191.18s)]
*  And I discovered that the United States was the number one investor [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3193.18s)]
*  Into the Mauritian stock market [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3196.18s)]
*  I thought how could that possibly be true? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3198.18s)]
*  And then I found out that it was all just automated investments [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3200.18s)]
*  From American retirement plans [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3203.18s)]
*  But it's publicly traded [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3206.18s)]
*  You could see the year-on-year results [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3208.18s)]
*  You could see the year-on-year ratings on security and sustainability [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3211.18s)]
*  And so automatically money was flowing that way [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3215.18s)]
*  Encourage those things [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3219.18s)]
*  When somebody's not thinking, encourage that way [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3221.18s)]
*  Other ways to de-risk are some of the contract enforcement [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3224.18s)]
*  Reliable judicial practices [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3227.18s)]
*  Those of course are different in every country [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3230.18s)]
*  They're different in every state in the United States [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3232.18s)]
*  So I understand the complications [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3235.18s)]
*  But making sure that people understand that if they come and invest there [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3237.18s)]
*  That their investment is at least safe [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3240.18s)]
*  That's another great way to de-risk [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3243.18s)]
*  So de-risking matters [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3245.18s)]
*  Okay, so we are going to open up now [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3248.18s)]
*  We'll try to do maybe two rounds [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3252.18s)]
*  I know we're running out of time [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3257.18s)]
*  And I'll try to be shorter in my answers [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3258.18s)]
*  We do have like a five-minute buffer too [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3260.18s)]
*  So for those of you who can stay on beyond 3 p.m. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3262.18s)]
*  I'll try to take maybe three also [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3265.18s)]
*  Drew? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3269.18s)]
*  There are like five there [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3271.18s)]
*  Femi, Akibi, Manchester Trade and I'm from Nigeria [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3274.18s)]
*  Just one question [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3278.18s)]
*  Have you been approached about damming the Inga Dam in Congo? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3279.18s)]
*  Inga? Okay [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3283.18s)]
*  If we do that, it will power the whole continent once and for all [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3284.18s)]
*  Thank you, that's all [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3288.18s)]
*  Okay, let's take Whitney [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3289.18s)]
*  Snatch the microphone [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3291.18s)]
*  And then the lady [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3293.18s)]
*  It's a jungle out here [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3294.18s)]
*  Don't get between Whitney and a microphone [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3295.18s)]
*  It's a jungle, I tell you [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3297.18s)]
*  Thank you very much for this conversation [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3299.18s)]
*  I've been putting commercial diplomacy at the forefront [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3301.18s)]
*  I want to follow up on Ambassador Matilda's question about de-risking [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3304.18s)]
*  And the notion of tax incentives for U.S. companies [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3309.18s)]
*  Which would help to change the dialogue from one of risk to one of opportunities [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3312.18s)]
*  And the second is you mentioned 71 deals [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3317.18s)]
*  Is there a website that folks can see what sector, what country and what dollar value [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3321.18s)]
*  So people can get more granular in terms of what's happening? Thanks [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3326.18s)]
*  The lady and then Mel and that's it [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3330.18s)]
*  Thank you very much [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3333.18s)]
*  Because if I don't give it to Mel, he's not going to forgive me [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3334.18s)]
*  Amy Stumbach, professor of anthropology and international studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3337.18s)]
*  And council on foreign relations visiting fellow [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3342.18s)]
*  My question for you is how do you connect commercial diplomacy to educational diplomacy and cultural exchange programs [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3345.18s)]
*  Which have really been vital for the connections that we've maintained across the Atlantic [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3351.18s)]
*  Thank you [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3356.18s)]
*  And then Mel, that's the final one for this round [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3357.18s)]
*  Mel Foot, constituency for Africa [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3360.18s)]
*  My question has to do with the role of the African diaspora [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3364.18s)]
*  And Trump's policy toward Africa [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3369.18s)]
*  You got a billion people in Africa [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3372.18s)]
*  You also got a billion Africans in the diaspora [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3374.18s)]
*  What is the role of the African Americans and the diaspora in this new Trump policy toward Africa? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3377.18s)]
*  Okay, that's for this round [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3384.18s)]
*  Okay, Roland, Inga [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3387.18s)]
*  I'm a big fan [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3389.18s)]
*  I've been advocating for engagement on that [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3391.18s)]
*  I know as important as it is and as much as I love it [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3393.18s)]
*  I tend not to stress things like it would power the whole continent [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3398.18s)]
*  Just simply because of line loss [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3402.18s)]
*  The usage of the electricity has to be relatively near where it's generated [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3404.18s)]
*  But you know what is near Inga is Kinshasa [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3410.18s)]
*  And so if you want to have the opportunity for distinct and significant economic growth in Kinshasa [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3413.18s)]
*  Inga is perfect [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3421.18s)]
*  And that matters because cities matter [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3423.18s)]
*  And so while it [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3426.18s)]
*  And by the way, and if you were going to do minerals processing [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3428.18s)]
*  Putting it within the sort of the concentric circles from where Inga is [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3431.18s)]
*  You could do a lot of minerals processing there that would matter also [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3438.18s)]
*  And of course what's near Kinshasa is Brazzaville [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3442.18s)]
*  And so you could get a good solid regional approach there [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3447.18s)]
*  It really is important [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3451.18s)]
*  So I'm a big fan of Inga [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3453.18s)]
*  We're not going to be powering gold mines in Guinea or in Ghana from Inga [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3455.18s)]
*  Just simply the line loss doesn't allow for that kind of transmission [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3460.18s)]
*  But it does mean that when you have available electricity [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3465.18s)]
*  Someone will come and use it [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3469.18s)]
*  We've seen that everywhere in the world [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3471.18s)]
*  We've seen that everywhere someone builds a hydrodam [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3473.18s)]
*  I just mentioned Ghana [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3475.18s)]
*  The dam, the Valco dam in Ghana was considered to be the permanent power source for all of West Africa [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3477.18s)]
*  And yet it was probably only about 10 years before they had to start rationing the power [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3486.18s)]
*  Because there was so much economic growth that was using it all [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3490.18s)]
*  That it's just a wonderful thing to see [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3494.18s)]
*  So yes, big fan of Inga [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3496.18s)]
*  Tax incentives [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3498.18s)]
*  That's a little out of my remit [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3500.18s)]
*  I love the concept [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3502.18s)]
*  Just not sure I'm the one to either address that [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3504.18s)]
*  To either fix it or even comment on it [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3507.18s)]
*  So I'll skip that [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3509.18s)]
*  But the list of 71 [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3511.18s)]
*  We don't necessarily want to publish the list [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3513.18s)]
*  Because sometimes it's got some things that are still ongoing [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3515.18s)]
*  And we don't want the arguments of that [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3518.18s)]
*  But we will certainly be making clear a large number of the examples [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3520.18s)]
*  Some of them you know well because when they sign there's big publicity around it [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3527.18s)]
*  But others, there are reasons why they're still continuing on with the project [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3532.18s)]
*  And they don't want to necessarily compromise their prospects [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3537.18s)]
*  And a lot of it's just business confidential information [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3543.18s)]
*  But we will be putting up a large number of examples of the kinds of deals that are happening [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3545.18s)]
*  How to link commercial with education and exchange [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3551.18s)]
*  I can tell you currently as we stand [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3556.18s)]
*  We use a lot of our exchange programming to focus on economic growth and on commercial advocacy [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3559.18s)]
*  But also on the sorts of things that make a good business environment [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3565.18s)]
*  Rule of law aspects [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3569.18s)]
*  We do a huge number of exchanges on that [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3571.18s)]
*  Our investments in education have not been very large for the last decades [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3574.18s)]
*  But I agree with you [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3582.18s)]
*  If you want sustainable growth you need to have investments in education [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3584.18s)]
*  The countries that have done that [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3589.18s)]
*  Have opened their economies and invested in their people [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3591.18s)]
*  Show benefits so rapidly and so significantly that they just can't be discounted [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3593.18s)]
*  For that I would largely say is when you get the investors paying their taxes [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3600.18s)]
*  And when it happens to be in the extractives paying actually paying their sovereign royalties [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3604.18s)]
*  That's the money that a state should use for its state functions [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3609.18s)]
*  I'm always a little afraid when somebody wants to put onto the private sector the functions of the state [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3614.18s)]
*  Because they tend over long term to be hugely problematic [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3621.18s)]
*  And you see that especially in the power sector [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3627.18s)]
*  But I'm getting a little off topic [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3630.18s)]
*  And then the diaspora [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3632.18s)]
*  The role of the diaspora especially with investors has just been incredibly dramatic [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3634.18s)]
*  But also when people see opportunity [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3641.18s)]
*  And again I'm going to have to go to a Guinea example [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3644.18s)]
*  Every single government ministry in Guinea [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3649.18s)]
*  Somewhere in their front office [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3652.18s)]
*  Chief of staff, senior advisor, minister, deputy minister [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3654.18s)]
*  There's someone in the front office of every single ministry who's from the diaspora [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3658.18s)]
*  Who's from North America [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3662.18s)]
*  And it's because okay I could just join the rat race here in the United States [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3664.18s)]
*  Or I could go be part of something magnificent and new [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3670.18s)]
*  And the desire to come back and put their skills and efforts into their [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3674.18s)]
*  I would say not their home countries because they're dual citizens [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3679.18s)]
*  But into the country that their families come from [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3684.18s)]
*  It's just amazing [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3688.18s)]
*  It also makes it kind of easy to be an American ambassador there [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3690.18s)]
*  Because you can always find a friend in the front office of every mission [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3692.18s)]
*  But also we tell you you've got to mean it, you've got to care [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3695.18s)]
*  Diaspora communities are fantastic at helping mobilize that kind of interest [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3700.18s)]
*  Diaspora communities are also incredibly successful here in the United States [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3705.18s)]
*  And so their ability to invest themselves and be leading edge investors has been spectacular [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3709.18s)]
*  Ghana and Nigeria are both particularly interesting examples of that [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3715.18s)]
*  We love the engagement with the diaspora communities [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3720.18s)]
*  And they've been incredible like sort of force multipliers in everything we're trying to do [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3724.18s)]
*  Great. We're going to take one more round [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3730.18s)]
*  I'm going to try and take it as met [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3733.18s)]
*  It's going to be the hunger games here with respect to the microphone [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3735.18s)]
*  But we'll do our best [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3738.18s)]
*  Okay so we'll take one from the gentleman there and then Steve [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3740.18s)]
*  And then we'll come here and then yeah okay [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3743.18s)]
*  Please make the questions very brief [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3746.18s)]
*  I mean we're running out of time [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3748.18s)]
*  Matias Hammer with Semaphore here [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3750.18s)]
*  Foreign policy reporter [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3753.18s)]
*  Did you say Semaphore? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3754.18s)]
*  Yes [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3755.18s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your comments regarding potential corridors beyond libito [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3756.18s)]
*  When you said this is something you wish this has happened to happen [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3762.18s)]
*  Is this something where there are concrete plans or ambitions within the State Department for to encourage or to foster some of these projects? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3765.18s)]
*  What can we expect from the State Department and from this administration on beyond libito? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3772.18s)]
*  Okay [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3778.18s)]
*  Steve? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3779.18s)]
*  Oh, oh [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3780.18s)]
*  Steven, that's okay [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3782.18s)]
*  Okay sorry [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3783.18s)]
*  That's my question [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3784.18s)]
*  Okay [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3785.18s)]
*  Hi, Steve Landy [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3786.18s)]
*  A quick remembrance for Charlie Wrangel [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3788.18s)]
*  For President Nujoma who both have passed very recently [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3791.18s)]
*  And we miss him [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3795.18s)]
*  Quick comment and then a quick observation then comment [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3797.18s)]
*  One, I woke up this morning and I said what the hell can I do at 83 to add something to this conversation [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3801.18s)]
*  I said I'm going to ask the new guard not the Talmud but artificial intelligence [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3807.18s)]
*  I asked him I said what would happen if we did not renew a GOA and allowed it to expire before the summit [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3812.18s)]
*  It came back with five paragraph answer which I will not read but I suggested you refer it to Scott Besant, Mr. Ludwig, Jameson, etc. to find out [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3819.18s)]
*  But it was a very good answer for those who would like to see [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3829.18s)]
*  Not a GOA simply renewed and enhanced possibly extended for a short time because we don't want to do it in a rush [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3832.18s)]
*  My recommendation was given the recent decision of the Court of International Trade which may put the schedule in terms of tariffs [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3840.18s)]
*  Can you suggest that the negotiations with Africa whether they're for the leadership summit [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3849.18s)]
*  Whether they're for the advice on the renewal of a GOA [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3856.18s)]
*  Whether they're tied to the reciprocal duty program that they propose the 10% [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3859.18s)]
*  That they be put together in one group and maybe we pull Africa out and we deal with it [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3865.18s)]
*  And my example would be the way we dealt with Canada and Mexico and the USMCA [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3871.18s)]
*  We excluded eligible products from any increased duties but we did work on improving them [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3877.18s)]
*  And I think Africa is very willing to take steps to increase US exports into their countries [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3884.18s)]
*  Thank you very much [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3890.18s)]
*  Thank you so much [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3892.18s)]
*  Cool [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3893.18s)]
*  Maybe two here and then two here [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3894.18s)]
*  Thank you [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3899.18s)]
*  My name is Rosalind Spencer I'm originally from Liberia next door to Guinea [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3901.18s)]
*  Senior Minister tomorrow [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3906.18s)]
*  Wonderful thank you [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3908.18s)]
*  But I've been in the US for a long time and my background is all pension, pension and pensions [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3910.18s)]
*  And you know that's where the money is [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3914.18s)]
*  The problem we are having is education [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3917.18s)]
*  And you hit that when you talk about we need education [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3919.18s)]
*  But we need education for pension investors who have the allocation [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3923.18s)]
*  But are reluctant to invest with African fund managers or in Africa because of the various reasons [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3928.18s)]
*  What is this administration doing in terms of guarantees, support, grants [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3935.18s)]
*  To help bring these pension funds up to speed so that they can invest in partnerships and opportunities on the continent [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3942.18s)]
*  Thank you so much [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3950.18s)]
*  There's a gentleman behind her [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3952.18s)]
*  Ben Mwanguchuchu I have a question on the Robito coal I am in the mining sector in DRC [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3954.18s)]
*  So is there a specific program to smelt the minerals on the ground [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3962.18s)]
*  Or is it Robito Coal just for evacuation [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3969.18s)]
*  Given the situation between the US and China where most of the minerals are shipped for transformation [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3973.18s)]
*  And then brought back to the US [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3981.18s)]
*  I'm curious to understand the whole logic [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3983.18s)]
*  Thank you [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3986.18s)]
*  Okay we'll take two more from here [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3987.18s)]
*  Hi, Zach Coleman with Politico [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3989.18s)]
*  I know the powering Africa summit you were there [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3991.18s)]
*  Talking about partnering with Africa on their energy transition to energy systems [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3993.18s)]
*  I want to know because climate change is affecting Africa disproportionately compared to other continents [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=3997.18s)]
*  What is the administration's policy on helping African nations implement their climate plans when it comes to renewable power like solar and wind [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4003.18s)]
*  Okay one more, Ryan [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4011.18s)]
*  Thank you my name is Ryan Masar I'm with the Center for International Private Enterprise [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4013.18s)]
*  We work with chambers of commerce and business associations in Africa to advocate for better business environments [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4021.18s)]
*  In your comments in Abidjan the second criteria that you said you were looking for a goal was [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4028.18s)]
*  To work on implementing the top five market reforms identified by the private sector [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4037.18s)]
*  I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that a little bit [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4043.18s)]
*  If you're looking for a formal process is the private sector the local private sector US private sector both [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4046.18s)]
*  If you could just expand on that point a little bit [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4053.18s)]
*  Okay sorry we'll have to close now we're running out of time [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4057.18s)]
*  And you know you don't have to answer all of them you can pick [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4060.18s)]
*  And then maybe they can meet you after the session thank you guys [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4063.18s)]
*  So let's see Lobito was the first one the idea of furthering it [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4068.18s)]
*  One is to continue I mean what we've seen already is phase one [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4072.18s)]
*  I very that's what I was saying is I want I want to see rail to Kowazi sort of in my time I want that to happen [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4076.18s)]
*  But that doesn't need to be the end of it I'd certainly like to continue on north from there [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4084.18s)]
*  I'd like to hit the lake to allow for barge traffic that could really open up not just not just Katanga [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4089.18s)]
*  But also the entire eastern part of of DRC I think these are absolutely critical [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4095.18s)]
*  These are the kinds of the infrastructure that are needed so we're definitely going to continue on from there [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4101.18s)]
*  But then also copying that as a model elsewhere I'd mentioned wanting to get across Guinea and into into Mali [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4105.18s)]
*  I certainly like to see something running through the length of Cote d'Ivoire [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4113.18s)]
*  I'd like to be able to link Rwanda to the rail both in Tanzania but also north as well [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4117.18s)]
*  Because these kinds of infrastructure investments pay off they just they just do we see where where they are [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4125.18s)]
*  But they need they need to be viable projects and that's what the the model was for sourcing multiple serious investors [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4132.18s)]
*  Blended finance and copying that model so they're definitely planning on that [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4141.18s)]
*  I was really glad that you mentioned using AI because that triggered my mind of of open AI wanting to do massive Stargate data centers in Africa [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4146.18s)]
*  The question is who's ready to do it and so if your country is interested you need to be engaging [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4157.18s)]
*  But you need to create the circumstances that make that possible [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4163.18s)]
*  They'll probably be at least two but that I keep saying it that matters and so we go to that [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4167.18s)]
*  But your question was about tariffs and while you were talking it I was wondering is I do you have access to my email account [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4174.18s)]
*  Because you seem to be reading exactly what we've been suggesting I would say there's one difference though [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4180.18s)]
*  I don't want to try to use Africa as one group and try to negotiate as a group because there are such wildly different experiences and situations [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4185.18s)]
*  If you have a country that's just sitting at the minimum 10 percent they don't care as much as Lesotho which is sitting at a 48 percent [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4195.18s)]
*  Lesotho cares they want to be there and so the countries that have the most immediate needs have already come forward with proposals [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4201.18s)]
*  And I don't want those proposals to just sit and gather dust while we try to work some kind of broad overarching decision [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4209.18s)]
*  With a bunch of countries that many of whom don't necessarily care that much but all the rest of it let's freeze this in place [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4218.18s)]
*  Give us some time to work start taking these proposals in and making decisions because the whole point was to bring us to a negotiated solution [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4225.18s)]
*  But if we're going to have a negotiated solution we need to start negotiating so that hugely matters to me [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4234.18s)]
*  Steve sorry sorry but I got a whole bunch more questions I got a whole bunch more questions [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4240.18s)]
*  So the pensions question about attracting the pensions [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4246.18s)]
*  A part of that is you think about the people that don't think it's well then make your numbers work [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4251.18s)]
*  Nobody was thinking about investing in the Mauritian stock market but their automated investment profiles made it happen because they saw the returns [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4258.18s)]
*  It's showing why if you try to do it as oh do it for altruism sake you're not going to get a lot of investors that way [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4266.18s)]
*  But if you're doing it because you'll get returns and by the way when something's if something is rated as risky but you really think it isn't [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4274.18s)]
*  That's a great bet if you're expecting you have to have an internal rate of return of 15 percent to make you know to overcome the risk of investing here [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4282.18s)]
*  But you don't actually think it's that risky that's a great bet it's so that's idea of promoting what the opportunities are [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4291.18s)]
*  But you show those numbers year on year on year you'll get people interested but it is there is a matter of just disabusing people of their preconceived notions [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4299.18s)]
*  And when it comes to preconceived notions I'll say one great opportunity thing on that was I was talking to a very senior official in the US government about Nigeria [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4309.18s)]
*  And it's like well of course but you know everything in Nigeria is based around petroleum [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4318.18s)]
*  And when I explained that the tech industry is larger than the petroleum industry in Nigeria I mean the jaw almost fell off of his face [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4322.18s)]
*  Because he just never considered that to be a possibility again because you're thinking in terms that are 20 years old [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4330.18s)]
*  It's a new place it's a new Nigeria it's a new Africa and so sometimes disabusing people of those preconceived notions [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4337.18s)]
*  This is why we have events like this to try to promote exactly those kinds of issues [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4345.18s)]
*  Smilting minerals in the in the DRC DRC is huge so it also depends which minerals and where [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4351.18s)]
*  And so if you're going to do massive operations with copper you've got to get it at least to cathode in order to be able to toss it on the back of the truck [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4359.18s)]
*  So there's some processing cobalt you need to leach it out with other types of minerals the processing can be done locally but this also tremendously energy intensive [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4368.18s)]
*  If you're somewhere if you're near Inga you can and Inga gets built the phase two and phase three then you're golden [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4379.18s)]
*  If you're close enough to some kind of grid or some kind of power source and we've seen some of the places mines building their own micro mini hydro dam [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4390.18s)]
*  Just on site just to power their own operation a lot of it really depends on that [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4401.18s)]
*  Remember it's cheaper and easier to ship refined material people ship the ore just because they don't want to bother doing this otherwise [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4406.18s)]
*  And that's where you see it processing but I'll say you kind of mentioned that and going and processing all that in the United States [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4414.18s)]
*  We don't do a lot of that processing that business model is the Chinese business model [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4420.18s)]
*  Yeah don't cover us with that we are not following the Chinese business model if you want to dig a big hole in the ground and you don't care that the river turns brown [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4425.18s)]
*  They're the ones you go to but if you want it done in a modern forward leaning way with the latest technologies [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4433.18s)]
*  Yeah and the river's still blue that's how we do that [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4441.18s)]
*  Okay climate change now you were at the powering Africa we talked there so you already heard my answer on this [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4444.18s)]
*  So I'm guessing you asked me because you just wanted me to hear it you wanted to hear it again [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4452.18s)]
*  But you know the simple fact is that we still mine coal in America and generate electricity from it [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4456.18s)]
*  So for me to try to tell a country that they can't use the resources that they have seems a little problematic [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4463.18s)]
*  And that's just not something we're going to do and so you heard Secretary Wright say it's all of the above [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4470.18s)]
*  Whatever what we're interested if you can make a proper viable business case will support anything [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4476.18s)]
*  And yes I said it in thing is that code for carbon yeah that's code for carbon [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4482.18s)]
*  But that doesn't mean we're not interested in green technologies [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4488.18s)]
*  I spent a good part of the weekend over the last couple days making phone calls to Nigeria about a solar project there [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4491.18s)]
*  We're still big on solar projects and when I'm down in Luanda in a couple weeks for the corporate council on Africa summit [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4497.18s)]
*  I'm going to be hugely promoting solar projects because we have viable business cases for it [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4504.18s)]
*  So we believe in in green energy because it's appropriate in a lot of places it's the best decision in a lot of places [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4510.18s)]
*  But we're not going to restrict ourselves from the other the other opportunities if that's what a country needs to do to manage its own development [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4517.18s)]
*  The exact same way Europe and North America did for their own development [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4525.18s)]
*  Ambassador I'm afraid we have to end Ryan I know you asked that question at least you had the opportunity to ask it and we can connect offline [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4529.18s)]
*  I know a lot of people have questions to someone mouthed a CFTA to me so I have to mention it [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4537.18s)]
*  But I think all of this shows that there's so much appetite for this conversation [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4543.18s)]
*  You can see that 90 percent of the audience here people here are still here even though we're running a little bit out of time [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4549.18s)]
*  Meaning that there's more people people are hungry for information the truth is there's a lot of disruption and there's a lot of uncertainty [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4556.18s)]
*  So if the more information we can get the more I think people will feel that they have a sense of what is going on with respect to US Africa relations [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4563.18s)]
*  And certainly we at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace we will continue to provide the platform to have these conversations [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4573.18s)]
*  We are nonpartisan and we're really interested in the policy shifts that are happening [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4580.18s)]
*  I really want to take this opportunity to thank you Ambassador Fitzgerald for being available to have this very candid conversation [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4585.18s)]
*  For being open to having an open Q&A with our audience and thank you very much to all of you for coming here today [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4592.18s)]
*  And finally thank you to my colleagues at the Carnegie Endowment the Africa program in particular [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4600.18s)]
*  Andrew Danek, Blaine Solomon, Alexander Chinadi, Sylvester Kwanzaa and Tani Washington as well as Jane Monga and all of the amazing work she's doing on tech [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4605.18s)]
*  And our colleagues and coms I can see Zach, Emily, Mira, Clarissa and a couple of others [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4616.18s)]
*  Thank you so much for making all of this a success I wish you a lovely evening [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4623.18s)]
*  Thank you so much [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4628.18s)]
*  Thank you [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZiXn_FL8Jc&t=4646.18s)]
