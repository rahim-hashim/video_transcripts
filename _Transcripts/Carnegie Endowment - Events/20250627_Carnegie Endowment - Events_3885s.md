Video Description: For more than a century, Soviet and Russian spymasters have poured enormous resources into the training and deployment of deep-cover spies known as “illegals.” These agents live behind enemy lines for years, sometimes even decades, to establish elaborate false identities.
In a riveting new book entitled The Illegals, longtime foreign correspondent Shaun Walker traces the evolution of the KGB’s most secretive spy network from its Bolshevik beginnings to a series of spectacular operational failures under Vladimir Putin. Walker’s book is based on years of investigative reporting, archival research across more than a dozen countries, and hundreds of hours of interviews, including with undercover veterans of Soviet-era and Russian intelligence operations.
Join the Carnegie Endowment’s Russia and Eurasia Program for a conversation between Shaun Walker and David Hoffman, the Washington Post’s former foreign editor and Moscow bureau chief as well as the author of several books, including The Billion Dollar Spy: A True Story of Cold War Espionage and Betrayal. They will delve into the clandestine world of Russia’s sleeper agents and what this secret history reveals about the enduring ambitions and risk appetite of Putin’s security apparatus.

*  Had real remarkable access to CIA operational material and was just a truly unique [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=207.52s)]
*  Espionage tale among the other things David has written and then our special guest Sean Walker [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  longtime foreign correspondent for the Guardian who is the author of what is now the authoritative history of Russia's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=219.8s)]
*  deep cover [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=227.12s)]
*  operatives program the illegals and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=228.72s)]
*  Sean I'll just by way before I hand this over to David [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=231.4s)]
*  This is his second book. I would highly recommend everyone the long hangover which came out in 2018 [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=234.76s)]
*  Which is a really gritty and very compelling picture of what life's really been like for people in the Putin era and really captures the way [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  People have become disillusioned and and and dissatisfied over the course of Putin's tenure [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  before I turn this over to David and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=253.16s)]
*  Sean I did want to just put my one little question out there [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=256.96s)]
*  Which is we're going to talk about these really intense Russian investments in time and energy [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=261.8s)]
*  to place people under fake identities in foreign countries and then conduct their espionage operations and I dug up last night this [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=267.64s)]
*  wonderful FBI [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=275.88s)]
*  Press release when they rolled up a series of ten Russian illegals [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  Who were in the US and I'd love this part on the FBI's announcement [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  We had them under surveillance for a decade so like you know their living rooms and their kitchen tables were bugged and they never noticed [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=286.68s)]
*  So I'm just really looking forward to hearing how these super spies managed to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=293.04s)]
*  You know I'll be arrested. You know over the series the last couple decades [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=297.36s)]
*  And what that tells us today about Russia's power on the world stage and priorities welcome both of you. Oh [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  And then I should mention. I'm sorry before I hand this totally over there will be book signing and a reception for Sean [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=309.24s)]
*  Immediately after this event, so I really hope everyone will stick around and and cheer Sean and David on thanks [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=315.12s)]
*  With my friend Sean I [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=328.04s)]
*  Wanted just to say a couple quick things [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  Then we'll have a conversation that I hope will go about 30 minutes [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=332.36s)]
*  And then we'll turn it over to your questions for 30 minutes. Maybe even a little bit longer [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  But I want to say I can [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=340.88s)]
*  honestly tell you that I was at the early stages of this book when Sean and I had a couple of coffees in Washington DC to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=342.92s)]
*  talk about it and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=350.68s)]
*  It gives me a great deal of pleasure to read it and see that it matured into such a fine piece of work [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=352.04s)]
*  I can tell you from my own experience that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=358.64s)]
*  writing a book about intelligence is [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=361.92s)]
*  Often really hard because there's a lot of secrets writing a nonfiction book about intelligence is really hard because there's hard [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=365.24s)]
*  Get those secrets out and to find the holes and missing information and then to write a book about Russian [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=374.24s)]
*  Secret intelligence, especially at this time. It's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=380.6s)]
*  Monumental and Sean has just handled this like a pro [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=384.32s)]
*  Cut through it like butter to use a few more cliches. It's really a terrific read [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=388.24s)]
*  It's deeply meticulously researched [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=394.16s)]
*  I think it's fair and it's illuminating and I get a try to help bring out some of this [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  In the next hour, but please will allow a lot of time for your question [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=404.16s)]
*  So Sean, I guess I'd like to start off by saying congratulations and then [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=409.3s)]
*  Asking you to tell us why did you do this book? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  Why did you take on such a really hard thing and tell us a little bit about the inspiration and the process? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=417.44s)]
*  Sure. Well, first of all, yeah, thank you for such kind words. Thank you Andrew for the invitation and thanks everyone for coming to listen [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=424.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a bit of it. It's been a bit of an odyssey this book. It's it started off in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=432.48s)]
*  2016 [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  when I managed to persuade the two sons of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=440.72s)]
*  two of the couple of illegals that were arrested in 2010 the arrest that Andrew was alluding to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=445.48s)]
*  And they'd been 16 and 20 at the time of the arrest [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  They widely are born both born in Canada [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=455.92s)]
*  Naturalized Americans they thought of themselves as Canadian Americans [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=459.44s)]
*  And the FBI comes knocking and it basically turns out their parents were you know from Siberia? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  Deep cover KGB spies who'd been in the field since before well SVR spies now [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  But had been in the field since the 1980s when they were KGB spies [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=475.68s)]
*  So [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=480.04s)]
*  talking to these two I mean no longer kids young men [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=481.64s)]
*  Got me interested in the psychological side of this this kind of almost impossible to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=488.12s)]
*  Calibrate story of well how how this could happen and how you could what it would be like to find this out about your family [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=495.48s)]
*  When you're 16 or 20 [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=502.52s)]
*  And [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=505.28s)]
*  At that time I just I didn't know much about the illegals program. I'd known you know 2010 [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=506.44s)]
*  I I was in Moscow then we sort of chased these people around a bit looking for Anna Chapman and the others who'd been [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  Deported in 2010, but I didn't know much of the history and I started reading it [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=518.36s)]
*  and I just [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=522.36s)]
*  It took me a while before I decided there was enough to do a book on it [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=523.68s)]
*  But through a kind of mix of all kinds of different sources interviews archives and so on [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=527.6s)]
*  But the thing that really caught me about it as well as the the psychological side was that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=533.32s)]
*  just managing to trace this program back a whole century and feeling like [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=539.5200000000001s)]
*  kind of at every stage of the way it was a really interesting reflection of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=544.44s)]
*  Where Russia was or the Soviet Union was at that time its priorities its relations with the West? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  So what I was kind of trying to do was like tell a bunch of cool spy stories [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  But also have a shadow history of Russia for over the last hundred years [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=560.52s)]
*  You know Sean there's a [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=566.76s)]
*  former CIA [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=569.76s)]
*  Fell who wrote a book in the open the book by saying when you strip away all the claptrap of espionage [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=570.92s)]
*  All the spying all the things you see on television and public culture [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=576.92s)]
*  What really matters is the cause for which the spy represents and you quote George Blake in here saying a very similar thing about [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=580.56s)]
*  The Russian side too, you know, what really matters is the cause and I wonder can you tell us these people who go out into the world? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=588.36s)]
*  Undercover for ten years disappear change their personality [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=595.84s)]
*  Were they believers in the cause of Soviet communism and you know, did they actually do this for? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=599.48s)]
*  Feeling that they were changing the world or were they just sort of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=606.88s)]
*  function in this [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a really interesting question and I think it I mean, I think we'll talk [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=612.12s)]
*  I'm sure we'll talk in more detail about the different periods of the program [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=617.48s)]
*  But I think the answer the change is depending on the time [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=621.1800000000001s)]
*  So, you know the first illegals in the 1920s the 1930s. These are really passionate communists [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=623.46s)]
*  Many of them have a background in the communist underground. They're used to having just bit working in disguise [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  They're really passionate about the cause [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=637.2s)]
*  and then later [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=639.88s)]
*  During the Cold War [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=642.56s)]
*  It's a bit of a different situation [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=644.12s)]
*  And of course that these are not people who already speak six languages and are used to living in the world. They're plucking [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=645.48s)]
*  Soviet teenagers who seem to be smart and promising at languages and putting them through this program and for them I think [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=652.08s)]
*  The kind of the motivation is pretty clear [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=661.48s)]
*  It's it's one of the probably one of the few where well definitely one of the few ways you can see the world as a young [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=664.08s)]
*  Intelligent Soviet citizen [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=670.32s)]
*  and then when they're abroad [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=672.6s)]
*  You know, the interesting thing about illegals is they don't actually see much of life in the Soviet Union because they're plucked out of university [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=675.92s)]
*  They're trained in these very very isolated [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=683.12s)]
*  Consequat theory like safe houses basically dotted across Moscow [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=687.04s)]
*  They have this they're not allowed to go out and socialize and have normal lives there [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=691.28s)]
*  So they don't see much of the life around them and then they go abroad and they do see all of the obvious flaws in [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=695.64s)]
*  the West and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=702.0s)]
*  So it actually becomes what I find I find it becomes quite easy for them to remain committed [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=703.6s)]
*  What's interesting to me is what's harder for me to explain is why? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=710.68s)]
*  Clever [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=717.68s)]
*  22 year olds Russian today or five years ago or ten years ago [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=719.92s)]
*  Would be motivated to do this and I think we had a partial answer to that. There was a recent New York Times piece about [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=725.4s)]
*  young early career illegals being caught in Brazil and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=732.56s)]
*  There was some leaked communications between them where they're basically saying what the hell did we sign up to this for? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=737.0799999999999s)]
*  like I mean what this is a disaster this life and I think you know now when [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=742.6s)]
*  If you're I mean, you know, there's an interesting question of post 2022 those opportunities are narrower again [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=747.48s)]
*  Ten years ago if you're very clever [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=753.4s)]
*  Russian who speaks several languages, you know, you have loads of possibilities different possibilities than you would have done in the Soviet era [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=758.16s)]
*  So I think trying to understand what the motivation is now is a bit trickier, but but certainly for most of the program [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=765.6s)]
*  People were committed and I think just to just finally to you know, the comparison with the CIA [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=773.24s)]
*  Situation I mean I think part of the I guess the point of that Blake quote as well is that you know, there is this kind of [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=779.72s)]
*  you know [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=787.56s)]
*  there is this idea of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=788.88s)]
*  sacrifice and of and I mean it's partly a mythology but it also does run through this right from [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=791.0s)]
*  The beginnings of the revolution and the underground that you know, this is something that you devote everything to that. It's it's sort of [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=797.96s)]
*  Certainly in the way that Russia now mythologizes the illegals it's this ultimate sacrifice [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=805.84s)]
*  It's giving up your normal life for the cause and I think that's something that has resonated over the years [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=810.6400000000001s)]
*  Just quickly. Can you help us? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=816.84s)]
*  Understand what does the illegals mean? Why they call me illegals and help us understand that versus [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=819.44s)]
*  The regular spies who are they? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=825.6400000000001s)]
*  Yes, I mean the idea the term illegal in Russian illegal now [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't quite mean illegal. It's like more like it's not about law, right? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=834.76s)]
*  It's no exactly like yeah, so it comes out it comes out of Lenin and the Bolshevik underground basically [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=838.7199999999999s)]
*  and [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=844.92s)]
*  during the you know the bizarre [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=846.68s)]
*  Before the revolution he gives like certain there were certain [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=849.24s)]
*  gentle liberalization so [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=852.88s)]
*  Lenin decided that you know, they're gonna use those possibilities and they will have legal operatives [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=855.24s)]
*  So the legal Bolsheviks will run for the Parliament [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=860.04s)]
*  They will work in trade unions and so on agreement above ground above ground using their own name their own documents [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=863.04s)]
*  And then you'll have the illegal side which will be you know in disguise will be doing things clandestinely [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  So that's the and then when the Bolsheviks take over they kind of transpose this on to [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=876.36s)]
*  their [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=882.56s)]
*  First operatives. I mean, they don't have diplomatic relations with many people [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=883.56s)]
*  So they can't send diplomats abroad in the traditional way and what would later the Soviets would call legal spies would be the spies [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=887.36s)]
*  Under diplomatic cover, but they do have all of these talented [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=895.24s)]
*  Clandestine operatives and so they send those as illegals. So illegals are really the deep deep cover [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=899.92s)]
*  They've never identified they want to be concealed forever. They're not under they don't go to embassies. They don't hang out at parties [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=906.2s)]
*  Exactly. And you know most big intelligence services have these rights of the CIA has Knox non-official cover [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=914.48s)]
*  It's a similar concept. They don't work in the embassy [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  but the difference being that [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=924.32s)]
*  Usually they are American. They're not pretending to be foreigners [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=927.08s)]
*  Of course in the Cold War there was no such thing as a traveling Soviet businessman or consultant [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=931.12s)]
*  Journalists that you wouldn't know anyone anyone presenting in New York as I hello [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=937.52s)]
*  I'm a Soviet business person trade representative [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=942.8599999999999s)]
*  They would immediately be suspected of being a spy because it's a closed society people can't travel [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=946.3599999999999s)]
*  So they need this extra layer of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  disguise [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=954.8399999999999s)]
*  to pull it off [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=956.28s)]
*  I'm just curious on this subject of how [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  Effectively did the illegals over this century actually remain concealed, you know [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=961.8000000000001s)]
*  We're all taken with the pop of our culture the Americans [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=967.4000000000001s)]
*  Introduced us to illegals in a big way [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=971.1600000000001s)]
*  But also the arrest of Anna Chapman, you know the whole idea that they were out there. I [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  wonder if if I were in headquarters and [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=980.9200000000001s)]
*  Is it possible to stay concealed for long periods? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  Did they succeed at that deep cover hiding themselves for a long time? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=989.08s)]
*  I mean many of them did and I mean on the one hand in a book like this you sort of you [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=993.5200000000001s)]
*  Inevitably have some level of failure bias because the guys who get caught or the women who get caught they are [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1001.44s)]
*  There's more out there about them. There's often the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1007.96s)]
*  counterintelligence [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1011.48s)]
*  Assessments, there's the you know surveillance documents and so on but I think when you look at the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1012.9200000000001s)]
*  Big source I used for the books in the trochan archive which was [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1018.72s)]
*  an archivist in the KGB who copied thousands of documents and then [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1022.88s)]
*  Took them out to Britain in the early 90s. And so here you actually have the raw stuff. So you you have [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1027.6000000000001s)]
*  Include you have people who you know would never nobody ever knew anything about them until he brought his documents out [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1034.44s)]
*  and yeah, you you see that on the whole it is very difficult to you know to go and [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1040.56s)]
*  Abroad for years and years and not be caught plenty of people manage it, but there's over the decades. There's [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1047.84s)]
*  You know endless cases of people either cracking up at this kind of psychological tension [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1055.24s)]
*  Some become alcoholic some go sometimes they crack up themselves and sometimes they get caught [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1060.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, or some yeah, they get caught or there's a defector who gives them away. Yeah [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1067.12s)]
*  But but there are you know, there's the one of my favorite characters in the book [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1073.1999999999998s)]
*  a guy called Joseph Grigoryevich [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1078.32s)]
*  Who was born in Lithuania? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1081.32s)]
*  He had he adopts the cover of a Costa Rican and even though he's never been to Costa Rica [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1083.9599999999998s)]
*  He gets appointed the Costa Rican ambassador to Rome [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  And he spends like [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1092.8s)]
*  Three or four years in Rome. He's meeting the Pope. He's meeting the Italian president. He's gets accredited to Yugoslavia [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1095.1999999999998s)]
*  He's actually been ordered to kill Tito the leader of Yugoslavia [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1101.52s)]
*  And then at the last minute Stalin dies the mission is called off and he's recalled back to Moscow and [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1105.3999999999999s)]
*  Costa Rica has no idea what an earth happened to their ambassador [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1112.92s)]
*  until [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1117.24s)]
*  1990 sort of 37 years later [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1118.32s)]
*  When the archives open and it comes out [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1122.12s)]
*  So I mean that's one example of you know [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1124.76s)]
*  It is kind of possible even in this quite high-profile job the guy was on, you know newspaper front pages and things [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1126.76s)]
*  Managed to keep it quiet [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1133.64s)]
*  You know so one of the important questions that this book raises that I wanted to ask you and I did ask you but [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1136.5600000000002s)]
*  I'll ask you again in front of everybody is [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1142.96s)]
*  Tell us if illegals really work in other words in intelligence [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1145.5600000000002s)]
*  Often talk about PI or positive intelligence the fruits of spying [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1152.48s)]
*  This is not the sort of sexy part about operations [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1158.0400000000002s)]
*  But it's actually about the goods and I wonder in all this hundred years [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1162.12s)]
*  Maybe you could break it down a little bit [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1167.6s)]
*  But were the illegals ever really successful at getting Russia and the Soviet Union? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1169.36s)]
*  Good intelligence did they ever have the access to get close to people to steal secrets or were they all? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1176.2s)]
*  Real estate agents that did cryptography after dinner [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1183.64s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean this is this is probably though this is the key question isn't it and I mean my it's a bit more complicated [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1187.68s)]
*  but my kind of [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1194.48s)]
*  Overview answer is that with it with every passing decade it got harder and harder to do this [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1196.6000000000001s)]
*  It got harder and harder to create like [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1202.32s)]
*  Solid [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1205.76s)]
*  cover stories and documents and to be able to bring these characters to life without detection and [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1207.52s)]
*  As it got harder and harder the returns got smaller and smaller [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1213.88s)]
*  So I mean in that in the early period like absolutely there was positive intelligence [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1217.72s)]
*  I mean some of these early illegals that are going out and the one that I focus on in the book school Demetri [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1221.8200000000002s)]
*  Bistro, I love [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1227.16s)]
*  Who's a super talented guy kind of speaks multiple languages? He has a cover of [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1228.5600000000002s)]
*  Hungarian count who's fallen on hard times and works for a bank [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1234.3200000000002s)]
*  And he manages to you know, he gets into the good graces of a British [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1239.16s)]
*  foreign office cipher clerk [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1245.72s)]
*  Blackmails him sleeps with his wife. It's the sort of full full package [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1248.5600000000002s)]
*  And you know, he's carrying out folders and folders of secret British diplomatic documents over a period of years [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1253.28s)]
*  And and there are several illegals doing things like that in the 20s and it's it is kind of a brilliant response [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1261.28s)]
*  to the Soviet need to understand what's happening in this diplomatic world that they're isolated from [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1268.8400000000001s)]
*  And to use the resources they have when they don't have reliable embassies diplomats and so on [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1275.16s)]
*  But then kind of with each iteration and you know, there's so many moments in this hundred years where you're like, okay [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1281.96s)]
*  But you know that was good, but maybe that should be the natural end of this program now and then it comes back and it comes back [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1288.38s)]
*  and [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1295.76s)]
*  Yes, certainly in the later Cold War [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1296.92s)]
*  They're not [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1300.76s)]
*  My particularly in the US for example, much of the idea is that they should be sleepers [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1302.2s)]
*  They should be there for if there is a hot war [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1306.6000000000001s)]
*  All the diplomats are sent home and suddenly you have these sleeper cells you can activate and they don't do that much [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1310.28s)]
*  I mean one one little bit of kind of counterintuitive conclusion that I came to is that [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1316.8000000000002s)]
*  You know even in the 1980s [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1323.4s)]
*  I mean it was they were only useful because the Soviet Union was so closed but because it was closed and [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1326.2s)]
*  You know, there were no Soviet tourists wandering the streets of New York without minders [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1333.3200000000002s)]
*  Even the people in the embassy couldn't walk freely and discuss things with Americans [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1338.44s)]
*  So if you have an illegal who after all this intensive training ends up [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1343.24s)]
*  Delivering packages in New York, for example [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1349.72s)]
*  And you think well, and this is the most absurd use of time and resources to train this person for years to do that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1352.16s)]
*  But then they write these reports back and we know that and drop off the chairman of the KGB [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1358.6000000000001s)]
*  He religiously read all of the reports from the illegals [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1362.76s)]
*  He would meet them in his office when they came back for their trips to Moscow. So in some weird way [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1366.0800000000002s)]
*  They were providing the closest thing to a kind of real insight into life in the West that the Soviet elite [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1372.24s)]
*  could get [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1378.72s)]
*  But it's certainly a pretty roundabout way to do that [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1380.48s)]
*  But couldn't they have just sent somebody out on the streets to soak up the mood [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1384.16s)]
*  I mean, did you really need to have a sleeper agent to tell you about the mood in the United States? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1387.68s)]
*  Well, you did if you were a society that didn't let anybody simply go, you know [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1392.16s)]
*  Even the KGB people in the embassy were being watched by the KGB counterintelligence, you know in the 80s you have [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1395.8799999999999s)]
*  the resident the legal resident in [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1401.56s)]
*  New York having even the wives of Soviet diplomats were not allowed to enter into any contact with an American [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1403.8000000000002s)]
*  So there just wasn't these there wasn't this casual understanding [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1409.76s)]
*  you know when you read the the memoirs of Yuri Drozdov who was the [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1413.72s)]
*  Became the boss of the illegals department [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1418.0800000000002s)]
*  He was the resident in New York for four years and it seems that in four years [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1420.0s)]
*  You know [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1424.6000000000001s)]
*  He went to the theater once and drove to Niagara Falls and the rest of the time he was in the embassy [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1425.2s)]
*  Where which was kind of a mini version of the Soviet Union so these people didn't really understand [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1430.68s)]
*  America didn't didn't see it in the same way, but is there any sort of great Cold War case? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1436.56s)]
*  So I realized the Cold War is the second part of this when we're in the illegal [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1441.96s)]
*  Brought home the bacon, you know really stole some secrets that were really valuable made a difference [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1446.0s)]
*  So I think you know one [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1453.8s)]
*  Trying to pinpoint the the giant piece of intelligence in the way of so you know the big successes like the atomic [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1456.68s)]
*  US atomic program which yeah, there was some tangential and illegal involvement, but [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1463.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's no there's no one moment where you're like wow if they didn't have the illegals [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1469.6s)]
*  They wouldn't have managed to do this what I think is quite telling and again [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1475.08s)]
*  Feels like this way that I saw it as the kind of reflection of the the sort of arc of the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1480.7s)]
*  Soviet period is that actually the place they're most useful in the Cold War is inside the Soviet block [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1487.26s)]
*  so they send when the Prague Spring breaks out in 1968 and [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  The KGB is terrified of is this going to spiral out of control like Hungary in 1956 [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1498.78s)]
*  And so for the first time and drop-off who's just been made chairman of the KGB [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1504.3s)]
*  He comes up with his plan to send in like 15 illegals [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1508.5800000000002s)]
*  disguised as Westerners [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1512.7s)]
*  So they will go into Prague they make friends with the people who are the leading lights of the anti-soviet movement the journalists and the [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1514.3000000000002s)]
*  artists and some of the politicians [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1522.18s)]
*  And they think this goes brilliantly for them. They send back information [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1524.5400000000002s)]
*  They provide kind of timely stuff that allows the Soviets to arrest people to crush this [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1528.1000000000001s)]
*  Uprising and they're so happy with this that they start to use [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1534.8600000000001s)]
*  There's something called operation. They call it operation progress and this goes on right until [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1538.0600000000002s)]
*  1990 and at some point they start using it also inside the Soviet Union [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1543.7s)]
*  So illegals will pretend to be from the CIA and they will approach [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1547.3400000000001s)]
*  Suspected dissidents to check whether or not the dissidents would agree to cooperate with these fake CIA people [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1551.94s)]
*  So, you know, it's really I think telling that you have this thing that was designed in the 20s is this brilliant [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1558.22s)]
*  offensive intelligence [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1565.1000000000001s)]
*  Operation and you're using it as a kind of paranoid counterintelligence [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1567.26s)]
*  Yeah, you I think one time in our discussions [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1572.1799999999998s)]
*  You said to the program had become Baroque and that's how I like to see it [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1575.02s)]
*  I mean they kept using it. It was very pretty and it had all kinds of [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1579.9399999999998s)]
*  You know decorations, but it's still hard to sort of see its utility [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1583.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and it just I mean as I say it becomes harder and harder you have hundreds of people [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1588.74s)]
*  Working on the back sort of back office of this, you know to look for possible identities to check if they will be suitable [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1593.78s)]
*  To check there are no relatives of the dead child. You've just found that you want to bring back to life [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1600.74s)]
*  You know to [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1607.1399999999999s)]
*  Facilitate all the communications with Moscow to spot the people in the universities to train them for years [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1608.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just this enormous [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1614.46s)]
*  Machine to sustain these people who then they get out and they don't actually do that much [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1616.46s)]
*  So for me, yeah, whereas the first part the sort of pre second world war [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1622.26s)]
*  It's really all about exciting spy stuff in the Cold War period [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1626.78s)]
*  I was much more interested in the kind of psychological impact of like what does it mean to [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1631.02s)]
*  essentially take on a new identity for decades and then to end up in actually not really a [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1636.3s)]
*  achieving much by the way of [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1643.38s)]
*  As you say positive intelligence. Yeah [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1645.42s)]
*  So one of the questions that I think we'd all like to hear from you is what is this story? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1647.94s)]
*  Tell us about Russia today. What kind of characteristics of Russia showing? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1654.22s)]
*  Essentially fielding illegals for a century that might help us understand [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1660.18s)]
*  Putin might help us understand the war [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1665.22s)]
*  Look, are there any sort of big lessons here about Russia and how it behaves? I [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1668.9s)]
*  Mean, I think what's what's interesting is that when you look at the the sort of post-soviet [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1674.06s)]
*  arc of this that again, I mean [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1679.94s)]
*  Soviet Union collapses in 1991 [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1683.74s)]
*  These people these illegals out in the field. They their instructions stop coming their money stops coming [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1687.34s)]
*  Kind of again. This is another one of these points where you're like, okay, that's obviously the end of this program [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1693.78s)]
*  Some people like the you know, the couple we mentioned at the beginning in in Boston they stay but [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1699.58s)]
*  Essentially many of them I come to the conclusion stayed because they quite like their new identities as you know [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1705.78s)]
*  Young Canadian family and why would you go back to chaotic? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1711.7s)]
*  Moscow when you could stay with your kids in this rather nice new life you'd build and it's only later when [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1716.54s)]
*  Putin comes into office and sort of resurrects the program that they come back in and sort of a rule into spying again [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1723.26s)]
*  I mean, I think the most you know, I think [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1730.1s)]
*  What what I've noticed? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1733.3799999999999s)]
*  In the last really five or six years is that in Russia [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1735.5s)]
*  This they've really promoted this almost a kind of cult of the illegal. So you'll see you know monthly [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1740.58s)]
*  documentaries on TV about illegals popular culture. Yeah [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1747.46s)]
*  Monuments documentaries [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1751.82s)]
*  carefully kind of curated books by former KGB authors who are given access to archive files and all of that all of the stuff we [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1754.1799999999998s)]
*  Talk about about you know, the psychological toll about the fact they weren't actually achieving much. That's all [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1761.54s)]
*  Carefully kind of avoided and as Putin himself said, you know, these are our greatest spies [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1767.02s)]
*  Nobody else has anything like this like they are [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1771.54s)]
*  sacrificing for the motherland and [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1775.1799999999998s)]
*  Kind of illegal so yeah, they've been put in the service of this this kind of idea of [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1777.8600000000001s)]
*  Russian martyrdom sacrifice [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1784.54s)]
*  Uniqueness that the Putin likes to talk about and I think that's part of the reason why we see that, you know [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1786.98s)]
*  yet again against all the odds in this time of biometric passports and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1792.94s)]
*  Easy travel and why on earth do you need to? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1798.5800000000002s)]
*  Train a Russian to pretend to be an Argentinian for five years when you can just have a traveling Russian and you know [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1801.9s)]
*  Do what every other most other? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1808.82s)]
*  Espionage services do I think that's part of the reason why Russia is still sticking to this program [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1811.8600000000001s)]
*  We still see illegals getting arrested kind of you know as we speak kind of thing [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1817.6200000000001s)]
*  And my last question is comes off of this which is in this world. I think all of us now live in a [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1822.26s)]
*  Sort of surveillance world that's different than the one of the past [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1829.7s)]
*  You know certainly China Russia and the United States all have heavy [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1833.42s)]
*  kinds of public surveillance and so on is it possible to run in the illegal program and when we live in this kind of [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1838.14s)]
*  digital surveillance world I [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1844.26s)]
*  Mean, it's very difficult which is why they keep getting caught I think [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1846.5400000000002s)]
*  And yeah, I think you know, obviously [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1850.0200000000002s)]
*  intelligence services don't reveal the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1852.9s)]
*  Sources but all the sort of circumstantial things [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1856.46s)]
*  I've been told about this recent wave of illegals being caught suggests that they've been caught through documents through [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1860.22s)]
*  anomalies in [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1867.82s)]
*  In the birth certificates and when you look at some of these kind of there's a case of the [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1870.82s)]
*  Suppose it Argentinian couple in Slovenia who were arrested in 2023 [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1876.38s)]
*  end of 2022 [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1882.1000000000001s)]
*  And [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1884.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he was he was an Argentinian born in Namibia allegedly [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1885.6599999999999s)]
*  So clearly they managed to doctor some birth records in Namibia pull out this go with this [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1890.5s)]
*  Say, you know, I was the son of Argentinian parents in Namibia. Please give me a passport [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1896.06s)]
*  I mean, it's so it's possible they were out there for ten years before they were arrested [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1900.62s)]
*  But it's it's clearly much much harder [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1904.86s)]
*  and just [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1908.3s)]
*  creating a [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1910.1s)]
*  creating a [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1911.34s)]
*  New character is very difficult. And I mean if and and certainly I think all intelligence services have had to cope with that, right? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1913.22s)]
*  You can't just there's no such thing as the short term cover where you just pick up [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1920.14s)]
*  One of your stack of 50 passports and travel the world on it and come back and take another one [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1924.18s)]
*  Because of fingerprints and biometrics and databases [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1929.1000000000001s)]
*  So I'd like to switch the questions I just want to remind those online if you have questions [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1934.66s)]
*  There's a QR code you can use to submit them and they'll pop up right here [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1940.84s)]
*  I've got one here waiting but before I do let's take a few from the audience [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1944.8s)]
*  I can't see very well because there's light but please raise your hands. I'll try and recognize people. I think there are microphones [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1948.76s)]
*  Do we have microphones Nina or just people should speak up [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1958.28s)]
*  Well, let's start right here [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1963.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1968.72s)]
*  We have it coming [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1971.52s)]
*  Thank you very much for an interesting talk [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1979.1599999999999s)]
*  Could you talk a little bit how the Russians prevent abuse on the part of the illegals? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1980.96s)]
*  I mean it seems to me if they've sent me to San Francisco and I'm living there with a false identity [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1986.76s)]
*  It'd be very easy for me to just I could make up fake sources [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1991.1599999999999s)]
*  I met so-and-so in a bar [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1994.52s)]
*  He told me this about the local political scene send information back that I read the newspapers and if they try to call me back to [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=1995.92s)]
*  Moscow I'd say no, thank you. And there's nothing stopping me from staying here because I've got a new idea American identity [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2002.0800000000002s)]
*  I speak perfect English. How do they prevent did that happen a lot? And how do they prevent that? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2007.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think that that classic thing that probably is [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2013.5600000000002s)]
*  You know happens in all intelligence services of kind of packaging [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2017.48s)]
*  Something that you've found in an open-source setting as some super top-secret intelligence [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2021.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean it's when you're when your bosses in Moscow as I say have so little access to what's really happening [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2027.58s)]
*  It's it's much easier to do that and that definitely happened in terms of you know staying there [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2034.86s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the things I was I was so fascinated by the training program and I spoke to a few people [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2039.6399999999999s)]
*  Who've been through it in the Soviet period and you know, you usually buy it by the 60s [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2045.9399999999998s)]
*  it was sort of four or five years of really really intense one-on-one with different trainers every day and [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2050.98s)]
*  obviously part of this was because it's really difficult to take on the identity of another [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2059.42s)]
*  Nationality so as language training it was reading the school textbooks of the country [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2066.18s)]
*  You're supposed to have gone to school in all this kind of thing [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2070.54s)]
*  But I also kind of realized that there was a way people talked about it [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2073.18s)]
*  There's kind of an element where it seemed more like a cult induction [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2077.16s)]
*  So, you know, they'd be followed around then they'd be tested on what they did [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2081.2599999999998s)]
*  And if they got a tiny thing wrong, it would be made clear that they'd been being followed and it would have been spotted [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2085.48s)]
*  They would have bugs in their apartment [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2091.06s)]
*  so, you know one I managed to get some training files from the archives in Kiev because some of the [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2093.3399999999997s)]
*  Some of the illegals were trained in Kiev and you see that they'd had without the operative knowing there's like hundreds of pages of [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2100.0s)]
*  bugged conversations when this guy's parents came to visit him in Kiev and they wanted to make sure that you know [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2108.08s)]
*  He's not he's his cover is that he's working in a scientific institute and you know [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2114.48s)]
*  They want to make sure he's not even in a quiet moment whispering to his parents by the way [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2119.28s)]
*  I've got a really cool job in the KGB and I'm being trained for this amazing program [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2123.08s)]
*  You just can't do that and as one of these characters said to me just he had this mantra that like you can't lie to the center [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2127.14s)]
*  You can't lie to the center and it was kind of drilled into him like something you just kind of [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2133.62s)]
*  Like you just repeat and repeat. So I think there was this exactly because you know, this is a paranoid [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2138.3399999999997s)]
*  Regime that is very scared about letting anybody travel without oversight and then they're sending these people out [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2146.02s)]
*  Who by definition they have to be on a long leash you can't watch them you can't have diplomats go to them [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2152.82s)]
*  so I think there was a real effort to [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2158.86s)]
*  To sort of in induct them into the program in a way that they wouldn't want to just stay in San Francisco [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2163.26s)]
*  But indeed in many cases [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2169.3s)]
*  You know that the program is kind of littered with there are on the one hand people who go through it all [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2172.54s)]
*  Remain ideologically rigid and go back again [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2178.94s)]
*  But then also people who you know, there's one one guy who goes out in the mid 50s and sort of within a week [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2181.36s)]
*  He's like got drunk decided he's fallen in love with the guesthouse owner where he's staying tells her everything [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2187.9s)]
*  And she tells him to go to the police to report it and he does [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2195.34s)]
*  So, you know, it's sometimes it works sometimes it didn't [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2200.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2203.84s)]
*  See one of the back here [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2208.6000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks so much for your book and for the comments you made a few minutes ago [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2210.6400000000003s)]
*  You said that when Putin came into power [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2217.28s)]
*  he resurrected the program and [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2221.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm wondering if you've seen any continuity [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2225.88s)]
*  Between the fall and the falling of the Soviet Union [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2229.96s)]
*  through that period of [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2235.12s)]
*  the 90s of the 90s in terms of the illegals and in terms of the [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2237.48s)]
*  Spies the use of spycraft [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2242.7999999999997s)]
*  You mean if they were still active during the 90s in that yeah [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2245.68s)]
*  So yes and no, I mean there does seem to have been some kind of [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2250.44s)]
*  illegals [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2256.6s)]
*  So so when you talk to the people who were out in the 90s they would yeah the [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2257.96s)]
*  The weekly radio messages the packages of money this kind of stuff stopped. So there was just nothing [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2262.6800000000003s)]
*  On the other hand you do have I mean, there's this [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2270.0s)]
*  Forgotten the year now, but there's a crazy story of I think it's 93 or 94 [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2273.16s)]
*  where [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2278.76s)]
*  To a couple fly in on British passports to Finland and they have you know cash and some radio equipment [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2279.8s)]
*  In their bag and they've got British passports [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2287.92s)]
*  But they don't know that there was an election in Britain like the week previously and they get their arrested and deported to Russia and you know [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2290.28s)]
*  There are these sort of isolated stories where I mean this stuff would never have happened in the Soviet period [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2298.28s)]
*  I think you do have people plenty of people [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2303.52s)]
*  like the Boston couple [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2307.88s)]
*  Andre and Yelena the ones who arrested in [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2310.16s)]
*  2010 who stay out all of these years [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2312.56s)]
*  But so I mean just just to like slightly expand on on what I was talking about when it comes to them [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2316.0s)]
*  So when I when you when I interviewed her [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2322.04s)]
*  And when she's spoken and you know [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2325.7999999999997s)]
*  She goes on Russian TV shows and talks about all this amazing stuff that they were doing and her [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2327.8399999999997s)]
*  Her telling of the 90s was you know, the motherland was in a difficult position [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2333.12s)]
*  But [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2337.52s)]
*  We wanted to help it and we knew that one day things would be better [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2339.56s)]
*  So we kind of stuck it out and we waited until we could be useful again for the motherland [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2343.2s)]
*  and when I was talking I tracked down some of the people that [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2348.12s)]
*  Andre the husband Don Heathfield [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2352.68s)]
*  Studied with and he did an MBA in Paris in [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2355.92s)]
*  1995 and again, Elena says oh we moved to Paris because we thought this is a place we would be useful [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2358.72s)]
*  For Russian intelligence and one of the one of the students who studied with with him [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  had this extraordinary story that [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2370.48s)]
*  That one of the lectures in this MBA was being taught by an economist from Russia [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2372.7200000000003s)]
*  Who was doing a course on post-soviet economics and out of nowhere? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2378.48s)]
*  Their friend Don Heathfield suddenly starts talking to this guy in Russian and everyone's like what the hell like don you don't know? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2383.36s)]
*  You never told us you speak Russian [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2390.96s)]
*  And he's like, oh, yes. Yeah, it's just like a skill that I have and then it's never mentioned again [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2392.84s)]
*  You know for me this like so talking in writing [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2398.6800000000003s)]
*  This is something an illegal can never do they can't whisper to each other in bed in Russian in the night [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2401.1200000000003s)]
*  So this is not a party trick that you just whip out at a lecture [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2405.36s)]
*  So to me this was this kind of eureka moment of like these these guys were not [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2409.28s)]
*  Working for Moscow collecting intelligence, even though actually on this MBA course [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2414.5600000000004s)]
*  There were all kinds of people who would have been fascinating for Russian intelligence and maybe later [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2419.24s)]
*  He went back to it and he was organizing trips to China for French businessmen [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2424.12s)]
*  I mean there was all sorts of interesting things and he later comes back and goes to Harvard Kennedy School by that time [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2427.92s)]
*  Maybe he was [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2433.24s)]
*  Actively working but this one story made me realize that actually maybe you know [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2435.2799999999997s)]
*  He was Don Heathfield's like doing an MBA and looking forward to his life as a Canadian [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2440.46s)]
*  And I just the one more story on that because it's one of my favorite [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2446.04s)]
*  kind of [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2450.6800000000003s)]
*  Is that so the the KGB as well as running its own illegals program and as well as spying on all the Soviet bloc in [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2452.1600000000003s)]
*  Operation progress it helped the others the Soviet bloc services run their own illegals program [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2459.1600000000003s)]
*  So the Czechs and the Hungarians and the Poles with KGB support ran their own [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2464.6s)]
*  Illegals and in one of these countries I was told by a source a kind of retired intelligence guy that [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2469.7599999999998s)]
*  When the country was preparing to enter NATO they kind of did an audit of all their intelligence operations [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2476.96s)]
*  And they were like, oh my god [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2482.96s)]
*  Like we have these files of these illegals that we sent out in the 80s and like no they never came back [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2486.0s)]
*  Nobody's been in touch with them [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2491.56s)]
*  So they sent they sent someone out to track these people down because like we can't have a spy living in a NATO country [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2493.04s)]
*  We're joining NATO countries and they knock on this guy's door and he basically says, you know [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2499.2s)]
*  This is my life now like my family don't know anything my background. I'm not spying. Leave me alone [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2504.64s)]
*  Go away, and they go home and think about it and they decide okay [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2510.24s)]
*  We think this guy's harmless will just leave him to stay there [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2513.66s)]
*  so there were these, you know, I think the 90s was this time where [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2516.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course some people stayed in some people decided to go home [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2521.12s)]
*  Some kind of ramp program was was [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2527.12s)]
*  Gently resurrecting I think in the late 90s, but it's only really when Putin comes back and I think specifically in [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2530.4s)]
*  2004 there is a kind of real push to okay [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2537.8s)]
*  Let's let's really revamp refund restart this program send out new operatives and then it's kind of an upward trend from there [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2541.44s)]
*  I [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2550.6800000000003s)]
*  See a few hands, but I got one or two online too [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2551.88s)]
*  And I want to remind people online you can ask questions with the QR code [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2554.7200000000003s)]
*  Sean do you think that the same amount of research will be able to be conducted in the future with things like archives? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2559.28s)]
*  Now are closing down foyer is getting harder. Could you do the same book today? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2566.32s)]
*  Well, I mean so I think [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2575.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah for the Soviet periods, I mean the big thing is the KGB archive [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2577.72s)]
*  That's fully closed. It's gonna be closed [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2583.0s)]
*  I'd be amazed if it reopens in the mission pieces right Matrokin, Lithuania [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2587.68s)]
*  Some stuff from the periphery. Yeah, so Matrokin is is great [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2593.4399999999996s)]
*  But Matrokin is like, you know when I when I got this file from Kiev of training file [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2597.7999999999997s)]
*  I made me realize how I mean Matrokin is fantastic [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2603.72s)]
*  But you know the man could make maybe four paragraphs of notes on an illegal maybe in the most [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2608.08s)]
*  promising case a page or two and [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2614.48s)]
*  The files of the illegal who was trained I got in Kiev three thousand pages just of his training [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2617.48s)]
*  It's operational files when he was later sent out. Those are all in Moscow. Those are closed [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2624.2s)]
*  So this there is there are files with an extraordinary level of detail [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2628.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of Russian books which are written by as I said KGB [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2632.2s)]
*  Historians, but many of them actually, you know [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2636.2799999999997s)]
*  When you there's a lot of interesting stuff that when you read between the lines, you know [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2638.7599999999998s)]
*  You're not getting everything but some of the stuff you're getting is quite useful and interesting and some of it's just interesting in that useful [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2642.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes, and then but the problem there is also a problem in terms of you know [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2648.96s)]
*  Data protection with archives in the West and that I mean while I was working on this half of the Matrokin archive was closed for [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2653.92s)]
*  GDPR kind of data protection grounds as a suddenly stuff that I'd been working on [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2661.92s)]
*  I mean a lot I was lucky to have seen most of it, but I couldn't go back and look at it again because it was closed [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2667.8s)]
*  Okay, one other from online. Can you tell us how close or far from fiction is the series the Americans? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2673.7200000000003s)]
*  I [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2682.52s)]
*  Think it's so, you know the so the Americans basically takes this family that I've been talking about [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2685.48s)]
*  Andre Elena Boston Paris NBA and [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2691.4s)]
*  Is two kids it's kind of their story, but they move it back to the 80s, right? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2695.48s)]
*  and the kind of and end game of the Cold War and [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2701.48s)]
*  Yeah, both my observations and actually asking you lana the same question of because they've watched it [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2706.7200000000003s)]
*  I think this [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2714.44s)]
*  I think the psychological aspect of it was was pretty well done. I think you know the the idea that [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2716.96s)]
*  One that one half of the couple was having more doubts than the other half [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2726.64s)]
*  I think that's part of the whole reason actually they started sending them out in couples because [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2730.0s)]
*  They realized that just sending somebody to be in their own personal unit was a recipe to send them mad and that if [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2733.7200000000003s)]
*  There was two people they could kind of support each other also [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2740.6s)]
*  They could if someone was really losing it they could drag them back before they defected this kind of thing so that I think that [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2744.2s)]
*  the husband wife kids family dynamics [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2751.52s)]
*  Missing them up miss missing the homeland all those things [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2755.6s)]
*  You know Elena has this extraordinary story of like flying to a South American [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2760.04s)]
*  capital to meet a handler and the handler kind of driving their hair out into a forest and giving her a bit of Russian blackbread and [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2765.04s)]
*  Shot of vodka and some letters from home which were then burned and then you know she goes back off and she tells her kids [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2772.36s)]
*  Like I was just you know on an errand in Canada or something [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2778.4s)]
*  So like that that kind of stuff. I think we're accurate, but the yeah the assassinations and the wigs and the disguises [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2782.4s)]
*  You know that what you quickly [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2788.96s)]
*  Find is that once you get to the Cold War and you get to this counterintelligence environment particularly in the US [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2791.04s)]
*  You can't like if you've trained someone for five years [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2797.76s)]
*  You're not gonna send them out to do a risky offensive espionage operation wearing a wig where they might get busted [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2800.1200000000003s)]
*  And on the occasions where they do try to do that people do get caught very quickly [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2807.4s)]
*  So yeah, I think on that side [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2812.2400000000002s)]
*  They were kind of the psychology was accurate for the 80s and the operations were maybe more accurate for the 20s or 30s [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2813.96s)]
*  I would say with the Americans all right Jacob Weisberg if you're listening I [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2820.5600000000004s)]
*  See some now in the room [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2824.52s)]
*  Right here in the middle I see a hand [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2826.6s)]
*  I think there's a microphone I [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2830.96s)]
*  Was wondering if they're [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2834.96s)]
*  The program that you're describing if they modernized it at all and if like right now [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2837.56s)]
*  What's the most like how how big of a threat is it to the US this program versus any other intelligence? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2843.16s)]
*  Methods that the Russians are engaging in [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2850.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean so I think the by his nature because the training is so hard and individual and long like this is always a [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2852.76s)]
*  Boutique program right it's always I think at the height of the Cold War there are about hundreds KGB illegals [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2860.68s)]
*  That had been trained at any one moment [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2867.7200000000003s)]
*  So I don't think you know if you like a few of my friends who for people [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2870.76s)]
*  I know who've like read the book and come back to me and be like, oh my god [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2874.92s)]
*  I knew there was something weird about like my neighbor [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2877.96s)]
*  I think I think realistically is unlikely [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2880.52s)]
*  These are it is a really small number of people and I think there are other aspects of [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2884.72s)]
*  Russian intelligence operations today that are perhaps scarier, but I do think was what's so fascinating about this is the [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2891.24s)]
*  And when you talk to the you know [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2902.92s)]
*  You know and when you talk to the you know [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2905.16s)]
*  Counterintelligence people about this program. There's a sort of this twin reaction [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2908.12s)]
*  And it's sort of the how I end the book well on the one hand that sort of say this is laughable [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2912.56s)]
*  I mean I can't believe we can't believe they're still doing this in 2025 like what a waste of time [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2917.4s)]
*  Ha ha ha and then they sort of stop and they're like, but you know [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2922.28s)]
*  You just need one in the wrong place and then it's really dangerous [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2925.96s)]
*  And that's why we still have to put all these resources into tracking them and I mean you see [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2928.7200000000003s)]
*  Just to give you one example [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2934.92s)]
*  Maria Adela Kufelt Riviera who was a Peruvian jewelry designer, but actually a GIU illegal [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2938.52s)]
*  Called I think Anna Kolobova Olga Kolobova. She was she was [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2947.52s)]
*  She was withdrawn actually, but later [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2952.6s)]
*  Kristo Grozev and [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2955.04s)]
*  these wonderful open source investigators [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2957.04s)]
*  Uncovered her because she had a passport number that was quite similar to some other known GIU operatives [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2960.14s)]
*  So she was living in Naples. She had her jewelry brand [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2965.34s)]
*  She was the president of the local Lions Club and she was organizing all of these events for you know [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2969.86s)]
*  US Navy people NATO people who are based at the military the the naval base in Naples [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2976.78s)]
*  So you can you start to think well, okay, that's actually [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2983.66s)]
*  Interesting and dangerous and [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2987.54s)]
*  and so I think you know the [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2990.4199999999996s)]
*  The overall answer is the no, it's not a threat, but then actually it can be still I [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=2993.4199999999996s)]
*  Know we have some more hands here right here. Can we get a microphone up to? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3001.2599999999998s)]
*  Thank you [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3006.98s)]
*  Thank you for the talk [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3013.42s)]
*  So obviously you mentioned that there were like a few gaffes like speaking Russian openly at the lecture [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3014.82s)]
*  But can you speak to the overall quality of Russian tradecraft like were they on? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3020.1s)]
*  Par with their Western peers or were they sort of lagging behind because of a lack of cultural understanding [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3025.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's a really good question and it's I mean I [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3032.06s)]
*  Sorry to keep giving these like a but B answers [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3036.14s)]
*  But it's kind of the same thing that I mean on the one hand it clearly takes like an enormous amount of discipline to you know [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3039.8199999999997s)]
*  Andrei Bezrukov posed as Don Heathfield in [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3047.2599999999998s)]
*  Canadian had a weird voice [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3052.66s)]
*  But I mean he would did an MBA with a bunch of other Canadians and they all thought there was something a bit weird about him [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3054.62s)]
*  but nobody [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3059.46s)]
*  Started to guess what it was [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3061.3399999999997s)]
*  So it's clearly quite impressive that if you could pull that off [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3063.58s)]
*  But [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3068.1800000000003s)]
*  There are also in that 2010 cohort there's nine or ten of them who are arrested in 2010 and [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3070.06s)]
*  The the way that the FBI got into their communications was that another couple had left [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3076.9s)]
*  I think they'd left the floppy disk and the password for how to get into their communication system in their house [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3083.98s)]
*  So the FBI did a house search found it and after that could read everything [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3091.38s)]
*  And that the sort of that was the crazy thing with those as Andrei said at the beginning [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3095.86s)]
*  I mean, you know [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3099.98s)]
*  This couple's lying to their kids for ten years and the whole time the FBI knows everything about them [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3101.02s)]
*  And the whole thing has been kind of pointless [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3106.34s)]
*  So it's a sort of I think it's it's it's a mixed bag I think you do get [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3110.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, there's been over the years there are people who are watched by the FBI for years on end and they don't spot it [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3115.78s)]
*  But I think it's very hard to spot and I think you know, that's [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3123.26s)]
*  You know just dimension Christo again [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3127.6600000000003s)]
*  He calls this the the hunter being hunted syndrome [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3129.5400000000004s)]
*  Like if you are in this position and you're sort of snooping into everyone else you kind of don't [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3131.9s)]
*  You're just not on guard so much [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3137.1400000000003s)]
*  Even though these people have been trained to like detect surveillance to go out on [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3139.42s)]
*  Do all of these surveillance runs? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3143.98s)]
*  But when when the FBI when the FBI has found them and kind of knows where they are and is doing this [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3146.1s)]
*  Somehow for ten years none of these people notice [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3151.86s)]
*  Well, now we got a bunch of them here [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3156.6600000000003s)]
*  Thank you, I'm a physicist so I like numbers and I wanted to know more about how many [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3169.54s)]
*  People were out there. He said a hundred or so at the peak and where were they located and how did the Russians decide? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3175.06s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna send somebody to Canada and Naples but not to [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3181.94s)]
*  Belgium and and also [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3186.58s)]
*  Curious whether any of these people were sent into very sensitive operations. We have North Koreans now who are [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3189.3s)]
*  posing as [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3196.42s)]
*  IT workers and working remotely in some very sensitive jobs [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3197.94s)]
*  Yes, I'll talk about the Soviet period because that's there the Cold War period because that's where the best archive data is for the for the sort of [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3205.5s)]
*  Geographical [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3213.7400000000002s)]
*  distribution so [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3215.38s)]
*  They used them everywhere [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3217.18s)]
*  The US was always the primary target and quite often people would be sent out for so Canada was usually a [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3219.54s)]
*  Stepping stone. So the idea is you go to Canada [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3228.26s)]
*  You'd build up your cover as a Canadian in a sort of less demanding [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3230.62s)]
*  Counterintelligence environment and then you'd move to the US after you were naturalized or after you got all your documents in order [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3234.86s)]
*  There was also yeah, sometimes that would happen with South America [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3243.02s)]
*  One of the people I interviewed so he was his cover was an Austrian citizen and he was in Ireland he was [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3247.14s)]
*  in [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3255.58s)]
*  Germany a lot and [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3257.3s)]
*  Part of his task was always to look out for Americans like do you as soon as you meet somebody? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3259.1400000000003s)]
*  Do they have relatives who live in America? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3264.5s)]
*  Do they know about America might might they be able to? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3266.54s)]
*  Be somebody who could be developed that would give you an in that you could later move to America [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3269.6600000000003s)]
*  So there was a focus on America, but [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3274.2200000000003s)]
*  illegals were working [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3277.38s)]
*  Everywhere there was some that worked as European business people and it was a Swiss beauty salon in [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3279.1400000000003s)]
*  One of the East African capitals there was a couple that was running it that were illegals there was [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3285.38s)]
*  Guy there was a trainer for one of the people I spoke to who his cover was that he was a [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3291.9s)]
*  Think a year big some kind of European businessman in Pakistan [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3297.2599999999998s)]
*  And there is that there's a really interesting moment. So after the Soviet Union and China have a split [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3301.3399999999997s)]
*  They try to start training Chinese illegals and they do this [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3308.38s)]
*  With a mixture of Chinese they tried with Chinese emigres and they try with [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3313.1s)]
*  some Central Asians Kazakhs [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3317.9s)]
*  Kikis who they think might be able to pass for Chinese and it's a complete failure with both of them [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3320.66s)]
*  and there's these stories of how they sort of infiltrate them and within a [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3327.02s)]
*  Couple of weeks these people always busted because you know [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3331.94s)]
*  They've one had like cigarettes that were only supposed to be given to foreigners and like local people didn't smoke them [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3334.5s)]
*  Some of the emigres had like forgotten the new customs of communist or didn't know the new customs of communist China [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3339.98s)]
*  and again, it was it was [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3346.86s)]
*  Much harder. So this this works really in a open society [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3349.5s)]
*  Where people don't ask too many questions where you can sort of blend in if you're trying to infiltrate an illegal into a closed society [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3354.3s)]
*  That's obviously much harder to paperwork and checks and people are looking out for suspicious aliens all the time [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3361.46s)]
*  Yeah, does that was that everything okay, you know [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3367.98s)]
*  Sean and I talked about this that in some ways the Russians and Soviets showed they were better at human source intelligence [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3371.66s)]
*  For a long time and the United States we were sort of getting our feet wet after the war [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3378.74s)]
*  We had these huge programs which Frank Wisner ran to infiltrate, you know, Ukraine Albania [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3382.9s)]
*  They were all disasters. It was very hard for us to get people into a closed society. It was much easier [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3389.58s)]
*  In the Cold War to get their [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3395.3s)]
*  Sleepers into our society and I think that's always been a dichotomy [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3398.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, just quickly on that. I mean, there's something I hope somebody writes a book about it someday, but there are these amazing [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3402.38s)]
*  CIA documents of this [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3408.5800000000004s)]
*  Program in the early 50s alongside all those ones you mentioned where they go to the refugee camps in [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3411.1400000000003s)]
*  Germany they look for [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3418.5800000000004s)]
*  Russians who emigrate [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3420.5800000000004s)]
*  Russians who emigrates or prisoners of war [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3423.14s)]
*  Yeah, and they train about 12 of these people up parachute them into the Soviet Union as kind of [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3427.42s)]
*  Illegals essentially and the idea is that they'll be sending back information and again, they [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3435.18s)]
*  Got five more minutes, let's see what else I got one another question here. Yeah [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3443.06s)]
*  Thank you [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3453.22s)]
*  You mentioned that with information technology is very difficult now to have a this kind of deep cover or reef [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3454.22s)]
*  recycling of one's persona reinvention of a persona and [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3460.14s)]
*  Yet we've seen several cases that could be arguably called [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3464.94s)]
*  illegals from the PRC [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3470.18s)]
*  operating for long periods of time on the West Coast and the East Coast [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3472.46s)]
*  and [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3476.5s)]
*  It's not clear that there's some systematic program in the PRC generating these kinds of [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3478.06s)]
*  Performers, but I'm wondering when you look at the news [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3485.02s)]
*  Do you given your experience and they question for you David also? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3487.7799999999997s)]
*  Do you sense that there is some kind of long-term extensive illegals program being generated in the PRC? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3491.82s)]
*  I'll tell you my answer absolutely [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3499.74s)]
*  And I think that if you look just at the transnational repression and the machinery that China created to carry that out [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3502.22s)]
*  Police stations all over the world hidden police stations [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3509.18s)]
*  I'm sure they have their resident orders and their illegals [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3512.9799999999996s)]
*  All over the place and it's probably been easier because there's a big Chinese [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3517.2599999999998s)]
*  Diaspora, you know for them to fit in I think it's an untold story completely [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3523.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I'm not a specialist on China, but what I would I think with the thing with the [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3528.64s)]
*  you know the the biometric passports and the and the [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3532.84s)]
*  Databases and so on is that in some ways it's actually a long term illegal is [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3537.04s)]
*  Easier to create than the kind of rotating short-term covers [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3542.36s)]
*  So if you if you're able to bring a character to life and you have the passport and you get your first fingerprints [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3545.7200000000003s)]
*  Kind of and you haven't previously traveled abroad with those fingerprints under and you know, that is then your identity [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3552.04s)]
*  That's something that I think you can do [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3557.56s)]
*  But what you can't do is this sort of switching and changing and picking up a new passport each week [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3559.32s)]
*  And also we've seen a lot of examples [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3563.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying anything secret here that the Chinese Ministry of State Security approaches people abroad [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3566.46s)]
*  Just civilians about their lives who are in sensitive position and tries to pressure them into into working for them [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3572.48s)]
*  And and there are threats the threats against their family back home. So in some ways their model could be a little bit different [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3578.56s)]
*  Okay, do I have any more questions out there oh here's one, okay, please [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3584.4s)]
*  Sorry, so I'm curious you last okay you talk about how they're indoctrinated [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3597.8s)]
*  During their training to believe in their mother country. And so even though I could see perhaps [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3603.56s)]
*  Being away from their native country and culture for a long time [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3610.52s)]
*  They still have an affinity for it [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3614.8399999999997s)]
*  What about language if they're never using their Russian? Do they do they forget how to speak Russian? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3617.66s)]
*  Nelzer so machine in your [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3624.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, there's a guy yeah, there's a guy what the the longest-serving illegal who went back in 2010 [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3628.7s)]
*  His name was Michael Vasenkov and his cover name was Juan Lazaro. He was a Peruvian Uruguayan photographer [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3634.7599999999998s)]
*  He'd been sent out in 1976. So he was what's that like 34 years? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3641.2s)]
*  He was living in New York. He'd retired already and he'd actually asked that he was as a favor [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3647.2799999999997s)]
*  He was allowed to remain in New York [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3651.7799999999997s)]
*  I had a Peruvian wife and the only thing only operational thing he do is once a year [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3654.98s)]
*  He'd pick up some money from a handler basically a pension [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3659.56s)]
*  And he was caught rounded up sent back in 2010 and indeed he could [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3663.6400000000003s)]
*  Remember Russian but it when you heard him speak it sound it was crazy Russian with a really strong [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3668.92s)]
*  Hispanic accent he didn't apparently he didn't like speaking it [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3675.88s)]
*  He wasn't happy to be back in Russia, even though for all those years he'd apparently been this kind of dedicated operative [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3679.6000000000004s)]
*  So yeah, absolutely. I think you do you people do forget the languages [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3685.5600000000004s)]
*  And I mean I I spent some time with an eight with a couple who were posted abroad under [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3690.36s)]
*  German speaking cover and I mean they still when they argue they still argue in German [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3696.1200000000003s)]
*  Okay, Andrew you want to close this up [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3703.28s)]
*  Thanks both of your Sean and David for doing this [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3711.1600000000003s)]
*  I just want to ask you about Putin and the illegals program and the way [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3713.36s)]
*  We've all seen Putin play ice hockey at night against you know, the greats from the NHL [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3717.76s)]
*  He's now saying he was part of this program himself [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3722.84s)]
*  And I'm just sort of curious what that tells you about Putin [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3726.48s)]
*  Is he a wannabe is he you know what what what gives in terms of his desire to you know? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCIJ7lwxpKM&t=3729.84s)]
