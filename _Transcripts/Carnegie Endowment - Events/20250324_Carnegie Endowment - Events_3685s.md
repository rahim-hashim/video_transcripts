Video Description: The Assad regime fell in December 2024, ending nearly half a century of iron-fist repression and over a decade of civil war. Now, a transitional government has formed, demobilization has begun, and leaders are working to address the urgent humanitarian, security, reconciliation, and reconstruction needs facing the war-torn country. As part of this process, Syrian interim authorities have taken early steps towards developing and implementing a national dialogue, a new constitution, and the transitional justice measures that will be needed to achieve an inclusive, sustainable and stable future.  
From the regime’s use of chemical weapons and starvation as a method of war against civilians, to the torture, arbitrary detention, and forced disappearance of hundreds of thousands of Syrians, the atrocities committed throughout the civil war are among the most well-documented in modern history. This has been due in large part to the documentation efforts of the Syrian civil society itself, with the assistance of the international community, which has mandated numerous investigations. Justice and accountability for such crimes remains essential to finding a sustainable path forward for Syria.   

What does accountability look like for post-Assad Syria? How can it be pursued amidst the varying, and often competing, priorities facing Syria’s new authorities? What challenges lay ahead for its pursuit, and what are the key avenues worth exploring to do so?

Join the Global Order and Institutions Program for a panel discussion moderated by Federica D’Alessandra, a British Academy Global Innovation Fellow and author of the recent Carnegie paper, International Crimes Accountability Matters in Post-Assad Syria, featuring former US Ambassador Stephen J. Rapp, UN Assistant Secretary General Robert Petit, and Nousha Kawabat, as they examine these and other questions.

# Looking Back to Look Forward: The Role and Challenges of Accountability in Post-Assad Syria
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI)
*  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's program on the role and challenges [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=0.0s)]
*  of accountability in post-Assad Syria. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  My name is Federica D'Alessandra. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=22.12s)]
*  I'm the British Academy Global Innovation Fellow with Carnegie's Global Order and Institutions [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=23.6s)]
*  Program, which is hosting today's discussion. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=28.76s)]
*  It has been a little over three months since Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria was ousted [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=32.68s)]
*  in a lightning rebel offensive that put to end 14 years of civil war and four decades [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=38.2s)]
*  of brutal rule under his family dynasty. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=44.2s)]
*  The unexpected fall of the regime was initially met with scupor and cautious optimism. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  As serious new president al-Sharam vowed to set the country on a new path of national [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  reconciliation and future stability, draw up a new constitution and hold the most responsible [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  among former officials accountable for the countless atrocities that they inflicted on [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=65.2s)]
*  the Syrian people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=70.08s)]

*  however, also left no doubt about the immense challenges that the country continues to face [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=77.12s)]
*  around issues of security, humanitarian and reconstruction needs, all of which are complicated [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=82.72s)]
*  by scarce resources, competing priorities, ongoing sectarian divisions and foreign interests [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=88.56s)]
*  both in Syria and within the broader region. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=94.88s)]
*  The pursuit of accountability in societies and transitions is always challenging. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=98.0s)]
*  And although a lot of groundwork has already been laid over the last 14 years, the complexities [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=104.08s)]
*  of these developing situations continue to raise questions about how to balance accountability [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  amidst countless other priorities and how this can or should be achieved as part of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  a broader transitional justice strategy for Syria. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=121.11999999999999s)]

*  Steven Rapp, who among other positions, but most relevant for this discussion is chair [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=171.92000000000002s)]

*  of the Syrian Civil War. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=200.72s)]
*  Thank you all for joining us, esteemed panelists. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=202.96s)]
*  We do have a lot of ground to cover. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=208.08s)]
*  So without further ado, I'd like to start with you, Omar. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  You are among the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have experienced directly on [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=216.56s)]
*  your scan the horrendous brutality of the regime. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=222.24s)]
*  Since your release, you've also dedicated yourself to supporting accountability efforts [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=226.08s)]
*  and advocating for other detainees in a sad, vast and horrific prison system. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=230.96s)]
*  I like to, I think it makes sense for us to begin this conversation to ask you to articulate [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=237.28s)]
*  maybe why accountability is so necessary as seen by those who have been harmed by this regime [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=245.28s)]
*  and why it is so important for the process of national reconciliation, as well as you [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=254.08s)]
*  address that, if maybe you can bring us up to speed in terms of why so much documentation [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=261.2s)]
*  is already taking place and where are we with documentation efforts more generally. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=267.6s)]
*  Over to you, Omar. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=272.8s)]
*  Omar. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=273.6s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=274.8s)]
*  It's been a few months since the fall of the Syrian butcher Bashar al-Assad and it's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  still unreal that that dictated fell. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  It's unbelievable feeling and it feels like a dream and every day you have to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=286.72s)]
*  really reread the news to make sure it's real because at some point, Syrians who fought [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=291.04s)]
*  for so many years started to think that he will never fall. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=296.48s)]
*  Suddenly, we had it on an early morning, the dictator has fallen. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=300.64s)]
*  When the revolution started in 2011, we documented everything not for the sake of any sort of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=306.4s)]
*  prosecutions. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=313.28s)]
*  We documented every protest we went to because it was a thing that we thought it will be a joy [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=314.0s)]
*  and honor to look back at the videos because the regime will fall in a few weeks. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  We always believe that the same regime will fall in a few weeks and we started, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  I went out to the streets and a few months have passed and then we started to see the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=327.2s)]
*  brutality. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=331.76s)]
*  The first documentation, the real documentation that I noticed of the Syrian war or the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  massacres of the Syrian regime against its people is the massacre that happened in my [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=338.64s)]
*  hometown, in my village when I was arrested for the first time on April 12th of 2011 when [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  intelligence services came and sort of invaded our hometown and burned and killed from the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=349.04s)]
*  famous video where they were stepping on the people and asking them, do you want freedom? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  That was the first documentation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=364.16s)]
*  It was by the intelligence services themselves documenting these brutality because they [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=365.36s)]
*  felt they are so impugned that they will never be prosecuted for any crime. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=370.8s)]
*  They could document everything, show their faces because this regime is so strong with [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=374.32000000000005s)]
*  its relations with China, with Russia, with Iran and all different parties that supported [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=378.4s)]
*  this regime for over 13, 14 years. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  And with the time we have learned that we have to document everything because we started [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  to believe that we need the help of the democratic countries around the world. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=392.23999999999995s)]
*  If we show them what we're doing, if we show them that we are on the street every Friday [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=398.08s)]
*  and then later every single day on the street asking for freedom and democracy, they will [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=402.23999999999995s)]
*  definitely support us in the end. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=406.23999999999995s)]
*  Their values is human rights, supporting human rights, supporting democracy here and there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=407.84s)]
*  And so we ask them for things just like what they believe in. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=412.23999999999995s)]
*  So it's very obvious that as soon as the world knows, the democratic world knows what we're [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=415.28s)]
*  doing, that will support us. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  To my shock and the shock of the Syrian people, the democratic world did almost nothing to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=423.12s)]
*  end the massacres that were taking place in Syria. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=428.55999999999995s)]
*  They welcomed refugees in many of the countries and for that we're definitely very grateful, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=430.96s)]
*  but they did nothing to stop the slaughter that was going on on a daily basis. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=435.12s)]
*  And Syrians with the year after year started to feel like this documentation may not really [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=438.96s)]
*  lead to something. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=445.76s)]
*  A lot of people would reach out to me and say, hey, I don't know if it's even worth [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  documenting that my son died under torture or my brother died under torture. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=453.36s)]
*  Who is going to prosecute this criminal? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=457.04s)]
*  No one cares. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=458.88s)]
*  The international community seems to not care. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=459.76s)]
*  But I and with my work with the Syrian emergency task force and the great support of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=462.48s)]
*  ambassadors who have arrived and actually triple IM, we have decided to believe that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  at some point this dictated would fall. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  I will never lost this hope because of the resilience that I saw the Syrian people for [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  13, 14 years. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=482.8s)]
*  They've been bombed, killed, slaughtered, displaced, starved, and yet people were, some [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  of them out on the street demonstrating peacefully and others fighting with weapon [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=490.72s)]
*  against this dictator. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=494.72s)]
*  Despite everything, despite the fact that at some point like Ukraine is being questioned [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  today, if they started the war against or provoke the war with Russia, Syrians were [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=501.04s)]
*  questioned the same thing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=506.16s)]
*  What was your mistake going out to the street and asking for something? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=507.36s)]
*  Syria was fine before 2011. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  We came to that level where the international community somehow decided to leave us alone [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=513.76s)]
*  and the Syrian people started to feel disappointed. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=520.72s)]
*  But there were so many organizations, so many individuals that decided to document [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=523.0400000000001s)]
*  everything on a daily basis from the massacre that were taking place to the demonstrations, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=526.48s)]
*  but also to the small and to the names and the pictures of people who've been arrested. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  And I remember when mothers, fathers, siblings, wives would reach out to me even like seven, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=537.12s)]
*  eight years since I got out of prison. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=545.36s)]
*  After I got out of prison, they would reach out to me and say, hey, my son was taken to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  prison in 2011. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=552.0s)]
*  Have you seen him? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=553.2s)]
*  Been gone for eight years. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=554.4000000000001s)]
*  Have you seen him? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=555.44s)]
*  My daughter, my wife, my husband, and so on. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=556.24s)]
*  Mothers, fathers, everyone would reach out because they had some slight, a little bit [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=558.96s)]
*  of hope that their beloved ones would be alive. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=564.72s)]
*  And the only thing that kept that hope alive is the fact that there was organizations working [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=567.6s)]
*  to document everything to see, okay, like Syria Network for Human Rights, making sure [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=572.24s)]
*  those people are documented, those people are registered, that there's evidence those [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=577.28s)]
*  are dead and no evidence that those people aren't dead or are dead. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=580.88s)]
*  And that helped keep the hope of the mothers, of the fathers and the families, that their [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  beloved ones may be still alive. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=590.64s)]
*  And then in December of last year, the Assad regime fell. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=594.9599999999999s)]
*  But that wasn't, for me, the most beautiful moment. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=599.12s)]
*  The most beautiful moment was just hours before that when prisons, one after one, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=601.52s)]
*  were being liberated. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=607.28s)]
*  You know, because when I was in my cell, I never believed I will get out in my entire [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=608.56s)]
*  life. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=613.6s)]
*  I never believed that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=614.0s)]
*  I always thought that I will die under torture. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=615.12s)]
*  It may take a year or two, but I will die under torture. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=618.16s)]
*  Then when I was taken out of prison, I was smuggled with a mock execution. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=620.64s)]
*  I thought I died. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  But it was so different to see when you're seeing prisoners, the doors being opened, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=625.6s)]
*  they are shocked, they didn't know what's happening. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=629.76s)]
*  And they run, three, towards their homes, to their families. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  Question, what's happening? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=636.96s)]
*  You know, not even believing that the dictator has fallen. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  The most beautiful moment that I've seen, but also the most heartbreaking moment, is [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  when families were heading towards satanic prison, trying to dig to find another floor [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=645.6s)]
*  to find their beloved ones. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=650.4000000000001s)]
*  And yet today, months after the fall of the dictator Assad, you know, only, you know, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=652.08s)]
*  a couple, maybe 20,000 prisoners were liberated. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  And you have, we were expecting 150,000 to 250,000 prisoners to be liberated. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=663.92s)]
*  Where are the rest? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=669.76s)]
*  Obviously, I know from my time that most people die under torture, but you keep the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=670.64s)]
*  hope for yourself and for the family to talk to you that they may be alive. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  But the reality is very harsh, very dark, that a lot of people died under torture. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=679.68s)]
*  But for a mother, for a father, for a family, who doesn't see the body of their child, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=684.88s)]
*  their family member, they will never be able to believe that their beloved ones are dead. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=691.76s)]
*  They need a sort of evidence. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=697.52s)]
*  And one of the issues we faced with Syria since the fall of the Assad regime is that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=699.84s)]
*  evidence is everywhere, but also there is no organizations on the ground doing the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=704.64s)]
*  important work of documenting everything, because before people come to those prisons, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=709.28s)]
*  civilians come to those prisons, some of them will paint that prison to remove the dark [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=713.4399999999999s)]
*  memories, which in their head, that may be a good thing. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=718.16s)]
*  But for someone who's been there, we know that this place should be left untouched until [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=720.64s)]
*  experts come to it and investigate the place, take evidence and so on. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=725.92s)]
*  Same thing with the mass graves. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=730.24s)]
*  In Syria, it's very necessary that the right documentation is being done, which is not [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=732.16s)]
*  the case yet in Syria. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=738.0s)]
*  So we need international support. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=739.1999999999999s)]
*  We need the organizations like the Ambassador of the Civil War and the Chabl Ayan are working [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=742.64s)]
*  to come to actually contribute as much as they can to collecting evidence, but also [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=747.36s)]
*  to build the cases against the Assad regime. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  Because even though we have built a lot of, using universal jurisdiction, we have built [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=755.36s)]
*  national courts against multiple members of the Assad regime, we still have Assad himself [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=760.4000000000001s)]
*  to prosecute for his crimes and his brother and members of his family and the heads of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=767.2s)]
*  the intelligence services and so on. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  So the work can one say, one can say, just started. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=773.76s)]
*  We have a lot of criminals to prosecute, but it's the important and good work and it doesn't [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=778.2399999999999s)]
*  have the miserable feeling we had for 14 years working like believing that this may never, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=784.9599999999999s)]
*  we may never reach justice. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  Now we close it to justice than ever before. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=793.92s)]
*  Thank you so much, Omar, for your powerful words and of hope and of course of pain for [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=797.36s)]
*  all that you and others in the country have suffered under the previous rule. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=807.52s)]
*  You touched on so many important points, the importance of accountability, not just [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=815.84s)]
*  for the purposes of national reconciliation and to sort of turn a page, but also for the families, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=822.64s)]
*  for victims themselves, for their own ability to find closure and to reconcile with the fate of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=829.04s)]
*  their loved ones. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=837.2s)]
*  And on the heels of that, and of course the importance of preserving the evidence that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=838.56s)]
*  continues to be unveiled about all that has taken place, including mass graves and prisons [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=843.6s)]
*  and so on and so forth. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=853.52s)]
*  I want to turn on the heels of that, I want to turn to you, Nusha, because we certainly know that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  as Omar was articulating, accountability has been an objective, has been a persistent demand of so [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=864.96s)]
*  many in the Syrian civil society. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=871.44s)]
*  And that's of course been articulated by your own organization as part of the work that you're doing [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  in the conversations that you are engaged in, including with victims themselves, as well as [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=881.7600000000001s)]
*  with serious new authorities about the importance of accountability as part of the transitional [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=889.5200000000001s)]
*  justice strategy, what that might look like, but also the crucial issue of the 130,000 people [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=895.12s)]
*  that are still estimated to be missing in Syria. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=903.04s)]
*  So I want to turn to you to maybe talk us through a little bit the work that you're doing and sort [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=905.92s)]
*  of how the center sees these issues and how to address them as part of the transitional [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=910.72s)]
*  justice strategy. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=917.76s)]
*  NUSHSA AL-MUZZAHID, M.D. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=918.64s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=919.28s)]
*  Hi, Federica. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=919.76s)]
*  Thank you so much and good morning, everyone. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm very humbled to be here, especially with Omar and Ambassador Rapp and Robert. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=923.84s)]
*  I think Omar ended with the perfect thing, which is to say, you know, we're in an incredible [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=930.24s)]
*  moment of being, you know, as close as we've ever been to pursuing justice. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=935.2s)]
*  And it's been really inspiring because, you know, I think a lot of the internationals are quickly [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=940.8s)]
*  losing hope or losing speed. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=946.96s)]
*  And I keep saying, you know, Syrians didn't give up for 14 years. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=949.52s)]
*  Well, as Omar framed it, you know, Syrians are being butchered. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=952.48s)]
*  And I think this is not the time to lose speed. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=956.64s)]
*  And I think that this is where, you know, we work together to accelerate and to push forward. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=958.88s)]
*  Over the past eight to nine years, ICTJ has been working with Syrian civil society and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=966.48s)]
*  have been documenting the violations that have been happening. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=972.0s)]
*  And a big part of our work was to amplify the voices of, you know, victims and survivors and to [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=975.2s)]
*  ensure that, you know, they play a central role in all of this. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=982.08s)]
*  You know, we very much believe in victims are the ones who inform these types of processes [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=986.0s)]
*  and that justice is not an event. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=992.0s)]
*  It's an ongoing process that needs to be embedded into every single conversation that we're having, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=994.0s)]
*  whether today, whether in the next year or whether in the next few years. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=998.72s)]
*  So over the past few months, like, Federica, you just said, you know, we've been quite engaged in [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1002.4799999999999s)]
*  these conversations, especially in Damascus, around, you know, what transitional justice can look like. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  I know it's not necessarily going as maybe fast as people would have hoped, but I think everyone [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1014.0s)]
*  sitting here, I'm sure watching and also on this panel understands that justice is a very sensitive [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1021.68s)]
*  topic and it's something that needs to be managed with care. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1027.52s)]
*  And at the core of that is trust, trust between, you know, authorities, trust between victims, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1030.56s)]
*  trust between civil society and the new authorities and all of this new Syria coming together and [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1038.0s)]
*  uniting with the purpose of justice. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1043.76s)]
*  In our conversations with authorities in Damascus, you know, in my very first conversation with them, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1046.8s)]
*  I said there's this focus on criminal accountability, which is incredible and which is [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  like Ammar is saying, this is the moment because there's so many people who have caused so much [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1058.8799999999999s)]
*  harm to Syrians. But again, these conversations are premature until we have trust being built [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1062.24s)]
*  between the government and its people, where we know for a fact that that's not there yet. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1068.1599999999999s)]
*  Transitional justice is not just about prosecuting perpetrators. It's about creating a Syria that is [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1073.84s)]
*  sustainable, that is peaceful, where every Syrian has a voice and has the ability to express their [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1082.3999999999999s)]
*  pain and the suffering that they've been through and to find the meaning of what justice means to [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1087.68s)]
*  them. And I think in our conversations, the first thing that, you know, I said to Minister Sheybani [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1091.52s)]
*  was, you're very lucky that, you know, sure Syria is in shambles, but this Syria comes with a civil [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1097.76s)]
*  society that has 14 years of experience. Like Ammar just said, you know, Syrians have documented, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1105.68s)]
*  they've done the work, they've put in the effort, you know, they understand and their expertise [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  and their experience and their experience and their experience in their, in all of this. And, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1116.48s)]
*  you know, engagement and, and reaching out to them and building those relationships will only make [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1121.52s)]
*  all of this 10 times better. And I think one, that's one of the main messages that we've [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1127.04s)]
*  continuously had with them is participation of, you know, civil society and victims is not [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1131.68s)]
*  optional. It is the only thing that will guarantee the success of all of this. Just to be fair, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1138.16s)]
*  previously, even with the Syrian opposition on issues around constitution, et cetera. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1144.3200000000002s)]
*  And we said the same thing to them is, you know, if you don't get the buy-in and the reflections [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1148.72s)]
*  and, you know, you engage civil society in your conversations, then all of this is pointless, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1154.88s)]
*  because at the end of the day, civil society is the basis of everything and the future of Syria. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1159.76s)]
*  So those are some of the main messages that we've had. And as I think some of you know, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1165.04s)]
*  we facilitated the meeting for families with the authorities in Damascus, which sure we saw as a [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1171.36s)]
*  symbolic step, but I think it was also a reminder that, which we all need to constantly be reminded [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1177.9199999999998s)]
*  of, that justice is about listening and centering people like Omar and the hundreds of thousands and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1184.3999999999999s)]
*  millions like him around these conversations. You know, justice comes from listening and engaging [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  and centralizing people like this because they know what the country needs and what the future [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1199.52s)]
*  needs to look like. So those conversations with the authorities, while still, I think, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1203.68s)]
*  at very early stages, we hope to continuously be able to say the most important thing is to build [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1208.16s)]
*  trust. And the only way to do that right now is through coordination. You know, again, you have [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1214.48s)]
*  organizations like institutions like the IIIM, the IIMP, you know, the Commission of Inquiry, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1220.4s)]
*  ambassadors like Steven Rapp, who are ready and we don't want this government to fail. We actually [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1226.56s)]
*  want success because Syrians need and deserve sustainable peace. And I think that time is now. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1232.1599999999999s)]
*  So I think there's many priorities that we think the government needs to be working on and that, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1239.04s)]
*  you know, we've been communicating, of course, preservation of evidence, you know, protection [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1244.6399999999999s)]
*  of mass graves, working with families and supporting them, you know, reconciliation and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1249.12s)]
*  amnesties. What does that mean? That's a very technical, complicated thing that we need to [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1254.0s)]
*  engage around and understand. Amnesties are some of the most powerful tools, but if not used [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1258.64s)]
*  correctly, you put aside victims and you push them away and that causes their pain and, you know, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1264.72s)]
*  the suffering to be even deeper, which creates even more, you know, strains on society. You know, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1271.12s)]
*  we're at a very crucial part in our history and I'm proud of everyone here that we continue to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  push for this. But, you know, right now government needs to also prioritize this, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1287.9199999999998s)]
*  which is security, but that also comes from national cohesion. What we saw, you know, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1292.96s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago is exactly this. It's time to engage. It's time to listen. It's time to center [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1297.12s)]
*  victims and families and civil society in the middle of these conversations and to understand [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1304.96s)]
*  that this is the time for us to all be partners in this and to engage positively. And I think [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1309.92s)]
*  for the internationals, you know, attending, I think Omar said something, you know, that I hope [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1318.96s)]
*  we can remember, which is this conflict went on for 14 years and civil society documented all [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1326.88s)]
*  of those violations because the international community told them, keep documenting, keep [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1333.68s)]
*  documenting because this regime is going to fall and, you know, we're going to be able to prosecute [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1338.16s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad and his government. Well, now that time is here and I think this is the time where you [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1343.2s)]
*  amplify the support to civil society because this is the only way that we can ensure that the new [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1349.76s)]
*  authorities listen and that, you know, they see civil society as partners by us continuing to, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1355.68s)]
*  you know, center Syrians around these conversations and ensure that, you know, they play this [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1361.84s)]
*  role and they lead the way. I'll stop there. Thank you so much, Nusha. You're so right in [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1367.1999999999998s)]
*  centering the need to have an inclusive process in which the, as you rightly said, like every [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1376.6399999999999s)]
*  Syrian feels like they have a voice because that's what you fought for for 14 years. And you're also [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1384.9599999999998s)]
*  right in underscoring how the, you know, when the regime fell so unexpectedly, many felt unprepared, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1391.04s)]
*  right? Because it was so unexpected. But I always think about it in terms of the only groups that [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  were actually prepared for this, where the Syrian civil society that have been carrying out [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1408.08s)]
*  persistent documentation for over 14 years, precisely because, as you say, not only did you [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1413.28s)]
*  not give up hope, but you very much look forward to the moment when all of that could be put to good [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1419.6s)]
*  use. And of course, as you also say, justice is not exclusively criminal justice. There is a lot [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  more to the concept of justice and to a reconciliation that needs to be factored in. But when it comes to [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1433.36s)]
*  judicial accountability, when it comes to criminal accountability, there is, you know, unprecedented [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1441.04s)]
*  opportunities, if you want. There's been lots of, as Omar was mentioning, universal jurisdiction cases [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1447.76s)]
*  in third jurisdictions. And of course, now there's the opportunity to also activate pending, you know, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1454.32s)]
*  lots of reform, of course, the domestic process, precisely for that purpose. I would like to turn [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1463.2s)]
*  to you, Robert, because of all international mandates and all sort of investigative bodies [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1470.16s)]
*  that have been created for Syria, you're the one that you lead, the IIIM, is uniquely positioned [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1477.12s)]
*  to support criminal accountability, because that's actually your mandate, but perhaps also play a role [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1484.4799999999998s)]
*  insofar as the broader transition is concerned. So I'd like you to come in and maybe help us [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1493.52s)]
*  understand a little bit more what the role of the IIIM is, why, how is it, how does it differ from [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1500.08s)]
*  other mandates that have been created over the years for Syria, and how do you see the potential [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1506.72s)]
*  for your mandate to play a role in the current, amidst current developments and further in the transition? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1512.64s)]
*  All right, thank you, Lassandra, thank you for the invitation, and thank you, Omar and Usha, for [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1522.88s)]
*  reminding us very clearly what this is about. And indeed, perhaps to make sure that everybody [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1527.92s)]
*  understands, the IIIM, it's much, much easier. The IIIM was created in December 2016 by the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1535.6s)]
*  General Assembly. 104 states decided to create, as you said, a unique body that is solely dedicated [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1542.08s)]
*  to criminal accountability for mass atrocities committed in Syria. We are unique in that way. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1550.0s)]
*  We're also unique in the fact that, as I said, we're created by the General Assembly. We're a [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1555.6799999999998s)]
*  standalone UN-funded body with no end date and limited only in the fact that we have a jurisdiction [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1559.68s)]
*  from March 2011 and to Syria. It is not limited to perpetrators or victims, although we obviously [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1568.4s)]
*  have a victim survivor-centered approach, but we are, in essence, what the Secretary General called [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1575.8400000000001s)]
*  us, a quasi-prosecutorial office. We don't have the power to arrest anyone or to prosecute anyone, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1582.48s)]
*  but we use international criminal law standards, recognized standards, to do what our mandate asks [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1590.16s)]
*  us to do, which is to collect, consolidate, preserve, analyze, and generate evidence of [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1597.8400000000001s)]
*  the perpetration of those crimes and who perpetrated them, and to support, as the [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1605.68s)]
*  resolution said back in 2016, current and future jurisdiction. As was mentioned quite eloquently, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1612.88s)]
*  there was always the hope that one day there would be accountability for Syria, a substantive, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1621.2s)]
*  widespread accountability for Syria. Now, yes, we are closer than ever to it, but back then, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1627.2s)]
*  it was an illusion. As some of your attendees may know, and I'm sure all of you know, there were [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1634.72s)]
*  several attempts by the United Nations Security Council to refer the crimes being committed to [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1642.16s)]
*  Syria to the ICC, the International Criminal Court, which would then have jurisdiction. Those [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1647.8400000000001s)]
*  attempts were blocked by Russia and China. There was no avenues for justice, so countries spurred [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1653.76s)]
*  on, motivated, and I should say very well by civil society, by Syrian civil society, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1661.84s)]
*  created this mandate and got it voted in general assembly. So since 2016, we have been preparing [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1673.76s)]
*  for this moment, but we've also been supporting what was until now the only avenue for justice [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1681.12s)]
*  for Syrians, which were those jurisdictions, those countries that were using their own [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1687.6s)]
*  universal jurisdiction legislation to prosecute crimes committed in Syria. To date, the IIIM has [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1692.9599999999998s)]
*  received 459 requests for assistance from 16 different jurisdictions, representing 315 distinct [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1702.08s)]
*  separate investigations and prosecutions all over the world. I'm happy to say that we've been able [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1712.32s)]
*  to support directly by the provision of evidence, analytical report, testimonies, 226 of those [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1717.2s)]
*  separate investigations and prosecutions. Up to now, that was the only light in the tunnel. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1725.28s)]
*  And now, obviously, we have this new possibility, one, as I said, which we've been preparing. We [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1732.88s)]
*  have been preparing since 2016 for this type of accountability. We've been preparing for [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1741.76s)]
*  being able to support it. A lot of our evidence, a lot of our data, we have almost 300 terabytes of [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1751.76s)]
*  it, was indeed collected by Syrian civil society to a lot of times, they're at their own risk and [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1758.08s)]
*  sometimes at their own tragic outcomes. But we've also been generating a lot of evidence, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1765.12s)]
*  and we've been collecting that evidence from various bodies, various international, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1772.4799999999998s)]
*  multilateral, or, again, as I said, civil society. And we've been using that evidence to also build [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1777.28s)]
*  separate lines of inquiries, cases. All the while, discharging that very crucial part of our mandate [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1783.6s)]
*  was just to preserve that evidence. And that role, I think, will be very important in the future of [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1790.96s)]
*  Syria accountability. But one other thing I wanted to come back to is that that role will be [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1797.52s)]
*  determined. The role that the IIIM can play in transitional justice in Syria will be determined [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1806.0s)]
*  by the Syrians. When I went in December, when I asked permission from the Karate Crew Authority [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1811.52s)]
*  to come to Damascus, I was there on the 21st of December, actually eight years to the day that [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1817.68s)]
*  the resolution was voted in the General Assembly. I wish I could say I was responsible for that [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1823.52s)]
*  timing, but I wasn't. But when I asked them to come, I said, I want to come and see how I can help. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1828.24s)]
*  Because that is the role that the IIIM, and that is actually the role that anyone, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1835.44s)]
*  but Syrians, should play into this, is to help this process fit our mandate into what Syrians [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1840.16s)]
*  will define themselves in the most inclusive manner. Otherwise it will fail what transitional [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1846.8s)]
*  justice means for them. That's why we have been engaging with the authorities since December [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1853.6s)]
*  on several occasions, and we are in contact with them, to be able to explain exactly what role [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1860.6399999999999s)]
*  we could play, again, depending on their position, and how we could bring our expertise [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  to the different fields that we have been working in since 2016. As I said, one of them is [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1876.16s)]
*  preservation. I was, as just everyone, shocked, understand, but was shocked about the amount of [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1882.8s)]
*  evidence, or what we could see in the first few weeks, the amount of evidence that was potentially [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1891.6s)]
*  lost in the aftermath of the fall. The urgency of going to Syria and to be able to help in the [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1896.0s)]
*  preservation, we're not going to do it all. As you said, as some have said, Syrian civil society [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1904.96s)]
*  are the most experienced, engaged, motivated actors in this field that have had the privilege [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1910.4s)]
*  of working in my five different tribunals or different accountabilities. It's a tremendous [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1915.76s)]
*  resource, as is the international community. We all have experience in this type of things, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1921.2s)]
*  but the IIIM, which has been doing this for criminal purposes for eight years, can certainly [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1926.4s)]
*  bring to it a lot of knowledge, not a lot of resources, but certainly a lot of experience [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1930.72s)]
*  and a lot of skills in helping to coordinate, to get this dialogue moving forward, and to preserve [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1937.76s)]
*  that evidence. It can then be used as Syrians will decide for accountability. You've mentioned that [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1944.0s)]
*  there could be a direct support by the IIIM to Syrian processes, indeed, but there is a lot to [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1950.08s)]
*  be done on the legal front before that can happen. Those processes, as Nusha mentioned, I think, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1959.04s)]
*  must be used to build a future stable, sustainable piece. Those processes, that judicial process [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1964.8799999999999s)]
*  must be up to international standards so that people can believe in it, can rest their hope [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1972.56s)]
*  for justice in it, and can use the results as a basis to rebuild Syria. The IIIM stands ready. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1977.6s)]
*  We're hoping to get permission from the caretaker authorities to come and work in Syria, to discharge [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1986.72s)]
*  our mandate in Syria. We need that permission. Syria is a sovereign state. We need the permission [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1992.48s)]
*  of the authorities before we can do anything there. As soon as we do, I can tell you the day after, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=1996.88s)]
*  we will be on the ground, and we will try and help in any way that we can. Thank you. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2002.88s)]
*  Thank you, Robert, for clarifying the uniqueness of the IIIM's mandate, but also [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
*  for underscoring something that is so important and really cannot be emphasized enough, which is [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2017.3600000000001s)]
*  no one but Syrians have a right to decide what type of transition and what type of [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  accountability forms they want to see, and everyone's role in the international community [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2030.56s)]
*  is but to assist that vision. So thank you for that reminder. I want to take this opportunity to [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2035.68s)]
*  also remind everyone in the audience who's interested to ask a question and interact with [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2044.96s)]
*  the panel to please send it over, post it in the chat, and I'll make sure that it is delivered. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2050.48s)]
*  But let me now turn to you, Ambassador Rapp. Stephen, you've been in the front lines, really, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2058.64s)]
*  of assisting and supporting, whether it's documentation, it's advocacy, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2066.32s)]
*  but essentially in the front lines of supporting opportunities and possibilities for accountability [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2072.2400000000002s)]
*  for serious international crimes. On the basis of where we are today, what do you see as some of the [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2078.7200000000003s)]
*  main avenues, but also some of the main challenges? What needs to happen on the ground in terms of [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2089.84s)]
*  the changes in the legislative framework, institutional reform that would need to be in [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2098.72s)]
*  place to make sure that accountability and justice can be delivered domestically, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2106.24s)]
*  but in a way that is inclusive and sets the course for a prosperous and reconciled future for the [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2112.8799999999997s)]
*  country? Well, thank you very much, Federica, and thank you, Carnegie, for bringing us together [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2121.3599999999997s)]
*  today. I've been to Syria twice since the overthrow of Assad, once in December and then [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2127.28s)]
*  again in February, and saw and felt the joy that Omar speaks of this day that we never thought [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2132.5600000000004s)]
*  would happen when this horrendous regime would be overthrown. But I also saw very much the demand [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2140.4s)]
*  for justice, particularly on this last trip going to the courthouse in Homs and seeing perhaps a [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2146.5600000000004s)]
*  hundred people there holding pictures of their missing loved ones, holding pieces of evidence [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2152.16s)]
*  about the individuals for whom they think were responsible. And moving around that courthouse, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2158.16s)]
*  meeting the judges and the investigative police with the new chief prosecutor Hassan al-Aqra, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2163.8399999999997s)]
*  everyone was grabbing his lapel and his shirt tail saying, my case, we need justice in this case. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2170.48s)]
*  And the answer was to send them to the police room where small notes would be taken about their [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2178.4s)]
*  case in a big ledger book. But basically, we've got to wait and see what approach we're going to [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2183.52s)]
*  take. And we need to move forward. That's my main message. I know that we need to build the trust, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2190.24s)]
*  we need to have the dialogue, et cetera. But this is something that frankly cannot wait. We already [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2196.96s)]
*  have seen the impact of the absence of justice, which often is private vengeance. Indeed, Al-Sharah [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2203.76s)]
*  said we must prevent the manifestation of revenge. And we certainly saw that in these horrendous [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2210.88s)]
*  acts that were committed in the coastal area. Homs itself has seen some violence, but not so much, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2216.7200000000003s)]
*  frankly, given the circumstances of a very divided community where whole neighborhoods like Bab al- [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2223.2000000000003s)]
*  Ahmad are completely flattened, where one can find the bones of children as one walks among the [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2229.04s)]
*  ruins. And then across the avenue, you see entirely intact neighborhoods, which were the [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2234.72s)]
*  neighborhoods in which lay of the people that were supportive of the regime. And frankly, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2241.12s)]
*  of the judges I met, most of them were appointed by the regime. But everybody's ready for a process, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2245.12s)]
*  but it's got to be a process based on truth, the process in which people are prosecuted on the [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2251.6s)]
*  basis of the conduct they did, not their association with particularly ethnic groups that [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2257.2s)]
*  they may share with the former regime or on the basis of even a job with the former government. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2262.0s)]
*  This is what the victims and survivors want to see. They've seen a system that's banned. They've [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2268.8799999999997s)]
*  seen a system that's corrupt, where all cases are made based upon torturing false information out [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2274.3999999999996s)]
*  of people. They want to see justice. And as others have said, we benefited enormously from [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2279.68s)]
*  the work of civil society, from the diaspora, but also because of people from inside that have come [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2286.16s)]
*  out. Omar and I working on the board of SCTF, where he's worked in running detainee affairs, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2291.6s)]
*  where we've had these defectors, people like Caesar. Now we know his name is Fareed El-Mawfan, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2298.08s)]
*  who brought out the 53,000 photos. We've had defectors like the gravediggers and the bulldozer [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2304.7999999999997s)]
*  drivers, who frankly buried thousands of individuals who were the cellmates of Omar [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2310.96s)]
*  in these mass graves. We've had the work of groups like CEJA, which I chair, which is brought out to [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2318.2400000000002s)]
*  more than 1.3 million pages of documents and shows the whole plan to sweep 200,000 or 300,000 people [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2325.04s)]
*  into the dungeons of death in order to suppress this hope people had that Syria might become a [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2334.2400000000002s)]
*  normal country. And I've said we had better evidence than we had at Nuremberg, but frankly, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2340.0s)]
*  we've got about 5% of the evidence that's available now in Syria. And it becomes extremely [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2345.92s)]
*  important for active efforts to go in and gather that. And so happy that we have the IIM, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2352.16s)]
*  which has been just a tremendous step forward by the international community, particularly in [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2360.16s)]
*  developing relationships with civil society. I mean, close to 100 relationship agreements [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2367.12s)]
*  with the person, helping build their skills and then verifying and vetting that information and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2373.2799999999997s)]
*  filling in the gaps. A key role in really helping coordinate the work of the NGOs and civil society [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2380.16s)]
*  groups that are really needed to do the work. UN can't do it from Geneva. People in Syria can do [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2391.04s)]
*  it. I mean, CJAS has 40 people that are Syrians. We're training more of them in Damascus. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2397.2000000000003s)]
*  So this is what needs to be done. But the key elements of all of this come from, I think, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2402.8s)]
*  the charter of Nusha's organization and transitional justice. What's the first pillar? Truth. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2407.6800000000003s)]
*  Second pillar, prosecutions of some of those responsible. Third pillar, reparations. Fourth [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2413.92s)]
*  pillar, fundamental guarantees of non-recurrence. And so as I've engaged with government actors, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2419.92s)]
*  the key part of this is the capital key one. And that is particularly the interest of the families [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2426.8s)]
*  of this 130,000 missing. Their documents have been pilfered. But according to the examination [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2433.04s)]
*  that our partners have done, there are at least 20 million pages of documents. CJAS in peripheral [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2439.6800000000003s)]
*  areas have now secured in government facilities more than a million pages. But it's in Damascus [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2447.84s)]
*  where the essential information is available. If we want to know what happened to the missing, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2454.96s)]
*  we'll see it in this regime mad. We saw it in Caesar. We saw it in the other documentation. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2461.92s)]
*  There will be information about when people were arrested and when they died. They won't tell the [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2467.6800000000003s)]
*  truth about what they died of, but they'll tell us that they died and they'll provide us with the [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2471.52s)]
*  false confession that they provided under torture, et cetera. And we can find a great deal [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2475.76s)]
*  from that information that can inform families. And then we need the project on the mass graves [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2481.5200000000004s)]
*  with survivors invited to come forward and provide the buccal saliva swabs, et cetera, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2487.76s)]
*  and those to be bagged and tagged. And then the process begun to excavate these mass graves. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2493.5200000000004s)]
*  And that process of truth can then inform the process of how to move forward in justice, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2500.88s)]
*  how to select those people who are the most responsible, not prosecute the conscripts, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2507.92s)]
*  but the people who made it happen. And also to follow up in finding the fugitives and getting [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2513.52s)]
*  cooperation of states to send those people back. And of course, some of that's happened already, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2520.8s)]
*  but people are sitting in detention when we don't have a process yet. And so they need to [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2525.68s)]
*  begin the process of deciding what kind of justice it's going to be. So as I say, in dealing with [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2530.16s)]
*  people, I can understand the desire to get it right, but I think there's nothing as right as [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2537.9199999999996s)]
*  establishing the truth. And that does involve the government. I've talked to Mr. Al-Khanaitra, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2544.72s)]
*  the deputy foreign minister who's in charge of the files on mass graves. He says he has a plan, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2550.96s)]
*  but it hasn't been approved yet at the high level. And then we can begin to build the process of [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2558.96s)]
*  justice that's the right of these victims. It's going to take international assistance. There's [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2565.68s)]
*  no question about that. And many of the groups are starved now of US funding, but there are other [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2571.44s)]
*  countries that are coming forth and I hope the US will eventually make ones available. And then [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2576.4s)]
*  obviously the IIM can perform an essential coordination function, but we have no time to [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2582.56s)]
*  lose. We can't let the vengeance be the go-to option of individuals. We have to see, and people [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2587.92s)]
*  in Syria need to see, a process of justice truly begin. Thank you so much, Stephen, for again that [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2596.4s)]
*  powerful intervention. And for your exhortation, it's really not just the importance, but the [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2605.36s)]
*  urgency of moving towards accountability as part of the transitional justice strategy. I want to [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2614.2400000000002s)]
*  actually, and also thank you for underscoring some of the ongoing challenges that are being faced when [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2625.04s)]
*  it comes to the preservation of evidence. I want to turn to you, Anusha, because you also just [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2633.6s)]
*  returned from Damascus and you have been meeting with and engaging with civil society on the ground, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2641.12s)]
*  with victims' family. And we keep going back to this point, which is the need to anchor everything [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2649.12s)]
*  with the needs and the priorities that are being expressed and that are being felt on the ground. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2658.4s)]
*  I want to take this opportunity to ask you, how do you see it? How do you see priorities? What [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2664.4s)]
*  fears and needs and hopes are you encountering in the course of your work while on the ground [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2671.12s)]
*  in Damascus and elsewhere in Syria? Thanks, Adriica. I completely agree with [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2677.76s)]
*  the Ambassador Robb that we need to get started. I kept thinking since our conversation a couple [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2685.52s)]
*  days ago about the main challenge, and I think clearly the main challenge is that there's no [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2693.2000000000003s)]
*  structures in place to be able to move forward with all of this and there's a lack of capacity. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2698.0800000000004s)]
*  And I see one of the questions, what kind of assistance from stakeholders are required as [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2702.8s)]
*  well. And I think this is the continued and amplified support. And I think that when I say [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2706.7200000000003s)]
*  that conversations and coordination is because we need to be able to build that capacity. And there [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2714.0800000000004s)]
*  needs to be this clear structure put into place to be able to tackle such issues as prosecuting [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2719.92s)]
*  people, which clearly right now is not available in Syria. I think, and then going back to your [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2725.2000000000003s)]
*  question, Federica, coming from Damascus, what Saamad was mentioning earlier, that this hope that [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2731.04s)]
*  people had of when prisons were opened and all of these people expecting to see their loved ones, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2738.8s)]
*  and then actually the numbers being so low and 20,000 people, I think, being released from what [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2744.8s)]
*  we expected to be 100,000. On last Monday, I had 15 family members that I met in Damascus and saying, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2749.6s)]
*  you know, has there been any progress? Has anyone approached you? Have you gotten any information? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2757.68s)]
*  Like Ambassador Rapp says, this all begins with knowing the truth and getting that type of [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2763.04s)]
*  information. And I asked one of the groups that was there, which most of you know, which is [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2766.96s)]
*  Families for Freedom, who have 250 families part of that group. And I asked how many of you had [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2773.04s)]
*  family members come out? Do you know what the answer was? Three. Three families found their [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2779.36s)]
*  family members from 250. And that is heartbreaking. And the more heartbreaking part of all of this is [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2785.84s)]
*  that they're paralyzed, they're frozen, they still don't have the answers, they still don't know what [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2792.96s)]
*  needs to be done, they don't know who to ask, what to do, should they move on, should they not? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2798.56s)]
*  Nothing's actually changed from two years ago when we kept saying families need answers. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2803.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, they're still saying, it was heartbreaking. Some of them are still saying, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2808.48s)]
*  I'm sure they're alive. I'm sure they're alive. And this is something that we have to bear the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2812.48s)]
*  responsibility for, because it's our responsibility to help families find the truth and find those [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2817.44s)]
*  answers. And of course, like you know, Robert is saying, and Ambassador Rapp was saying, that only [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2824.16s)]
*  comes also with the cooperation of the government and being able to put in those structures and put [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2829.6s)]
*  in those processes that would allow us to do this. So I think, you know, there's this real [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2834.72s)]
*  frustration because the reality of all of this is transparency. And families need to know what's [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2839.7599999999998s)]
*  going on, victims need to know what the process is, and they need to be, you know, included in [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2847.2799999999997s)]
*  what the next steps are going to be in the meeting with the families and the authorities that we [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2854.16s)]
*  organized in February. You know, one of the things that they said, which Ambassador Rapp, I think, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2858.24s)]
*  just mentioned very eloquently is that one of the families said, please, if you capture a [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2863.6s)]
*  perpetrator, somebody you assume is a perpetrator, please don't kill them, because these people might [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2870.24s)]
*  have the answers and these people might have the evidence, but we need to start having those [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2875.8399999999997s)]
*  conversations and figuring out what all of this looks like. And one of the other things that they [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2879.8399999999997s)]
*  mentioned is this issue of non-recurrence. They said, please, no more disappearances, no more [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2885.36s)]
*  torture, because, you know, this is time to move forward. And I think this frustration we need to [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2890.56s)]
*  address and we need to figure out how to put in the structures and the processes that would allow [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2895.68s)]
*  us to, you know, help families and bring people to justice. Thank you so much, Nusha. I wanted to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2899.7599999999998s)]
*  invite Omar also to, you know, integrate your perspective if you wanted to speak to this. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2909.2799999999997s)]
*  And right before I do that, I also wanted to pose a question to Robert specifically, but everyone [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2915.6s)]
*  obviously can wait in. There are a number of questions that are coming from the audience about [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2923.12s)]
*  specific violations. I mean, we've talked about disappearance, we've talked about [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2929.36s)]
*  torture, but there's questions coming through about, you know, accountability for violations [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2933.36s)]
*  and for crimes committed against, you know, whether it's journalists, it's health [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2940.24s)]
*  and humanitarian workers, the use of chemical weapons. So I'll just put the question out there [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2944.08s)]
*  for those that want to address it, but let's turn to you, Omar, first. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2949.68s)]
*  Yeah, the regime of Bashar al-Assad has involved tens of thousands, if not a hundred thousand people [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2956.56s)]
*  in committing these crimes that happened in the last 14 years. And the regime obviously focused [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2964.56s)]
*  on one sect in the Dalawites and using as many of the young people of the Dalawites to go and [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2969.84s)]
*  they kill the rest, which has been obvious in the years that have passed. And the regime made sure [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2976.1600000000003s)]
*  that everyone knows that many of the perpetrators have been Alawites. This is obviously, you know, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2982.8s)]
*  people from the all sects and all religions and all backgrounds in Syria have been participating [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2989.6000000000004s)]
*  in the massacres. But because the Assad regime has relied mainly on Alawites, it built a narrative [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=2994.24s)]
*  that it's Alawites that are killing the rest of the country, mostly, you know, the majority of the [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3003.52s)]
*  country is Sunnis. And when the regime fell, I was expecting a lot of bad things to happen, a lot of [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3008.3999999999996s)]
*  massacres to happen. And what happened on the coast is miserable. And it's very sad it happened. But [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3015.8399999999997s)]
*  at the same time, I think it was the lowest thing, you know, the minimum amount of revenge killing [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3023.04s)]
*  that happened. And I think it should definitely the perpetrators and the criminals who did that [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3029.68s)]
*  should be prosecuted, regardless of what side you are on with the current government, with the [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3034.96s)]
*  former governor or so on. You committed a crime, you killed someone innocent, you should be [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3039.92s)]
*  prosecuted for your crimes. And I think as you mentioned, it's very necessary to bring the truth [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3043.6s)]
*  so people know what happened. Otherwise, you can't, you wouldn't be able to move forward [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3050.16s)]
*  with anything. Nobody is going to accept anything before they know their beloved ones [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3054.3999999999996s)]
*  are dead or alive. Nobody's going to move forward with anything, not even with their daily life. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3058.64s)]
*  You know, they will always go to the, you know, to a center somewhere and walk around and have [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3063.92s)]
*  the picture of their loved ones until they are informed. And that's the responsibility of [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3068.8799999999997s)]
*  of experts who can actually come with a statement with the government as well to say, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3074.1600000000003s)]
*  we have to inform the population that if your beloved ones are not back to you, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3079.92s)]
*  they are dead. That applies to the majority of the political prisoners, if not all of them. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3087.92s)]
*  And that is a very horrible news or statement to say in public to the whole population. So the [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3093.6000000000004s)]
*  government itself, I'm not sure that will at some point come and say that because they don't dare [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3101.52s)]
*  in a way to break the hearts of 200,000 families in Syria. And that is an issue. So it's the [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3108.88s)]
*  responsibility of people who've been there like me to tell the reality. Like from the day I got out, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3116.4s)]
*  I said, there are endless number of executions taking place every day. Most of the people in [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3123.76s)]
*  the cell you're sitting in die under torture, under starvation, under diseases and so on. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3129.36s)]
*  So if you're in a room with 100 people, 95 people die and they take the five people and they place [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3135.04s)]
*  them in five different rooms. And that goes on endlessly until the day I get out. And then [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3139.6s)]
*  when Branch 215, we were, and here comes some issue with the documentation. And the fact that [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3146.0s)]
*  a lot of people were dying and then when the disease is spread in prison, the guards don't [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3152.56s)]
*  want to come in because it's infectious diseases everywhere. So they want to give the task of [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3156.64s)]
*  documenting the death to the prisoners. So prisoners were responsible for documenting. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3161.44s)]
*  As you can see in the seizure photos, there are many prisoners with numbers on their forehead [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3166.7999999999997s)]
*  and the parts of their bodies and so on. That was done by an external nurse coming before. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3171.04s)]
*  But then later when the disease spread in Branch 215 under the ground in the basement, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3178.4s)]
*  prisoners were tasked to do that. And those prisoners at some point have to figure out a [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3182.7999999999997s)]
*  way to help each other. So when I was in prison with my cousins Rashad and Bashir [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3188.7999999999997s)]
*  and under torture in the first month of investigation, Rashad didn't give any false [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3194.64s)]
*  confession, but Bashir did. But Bashir died first. So what we did is we registered [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3199.68s)]
*  Rashad dead with his brother's name because his brother [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3206.88s)]
*  had a false confession that he killed. And if you killed, you're probably going to be taken [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3215.36s)]
*  to execution. So we switched their names, switched their files in order to give the one who was alive [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3218.48s)]
*  an opportunity or a hope that if he get taken to court, maybe the judge may be reasonable and [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3223.12s)]
*  let him go out. So in other words, many prisoners who are registered dead in the [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3230.32s)]
*  Syrian regime's files, former regime's files, were alive and some of them were alive or registered [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3237.76s)]
*  dead and so on. So there's some confusion and the work of justice in Syria is going to be [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3245.52s)]
*  complicated. And considering the fact that there's so high number of people who died, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3250.56s)]
*  committed crimes in Syria, you will not be able to prosecute everyone. Clearly you won't be able [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3254.88s)]
*  to bring everyone back to put them in court, especially with some huge democratic countries [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3261.04s)]
*  undermining the role of justice by putting sanctions on courts and so on. Such an embarrassment, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3267.04s)]
*  I would say. Calling yourself democracy and then going, putting sanctions and limiting the work of [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3273.2000000000003s)]
*  the most important court in the world, the International Criminal Court. So in a way, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3280.16s)]
*  I think justice starts with the truth and the truth is partly the responsibility of the Syrian [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3286.3999999999996s)]
*  people to go out and speak. Everyone who been there need to come out and speak. Everyone, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3294.72s)]
*  even the people who worked and then they defected from the regime who worked in those prison need [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3300.3999999999996s)]
*  to come out and speak to tell what exactly was happening, how we could end the role of [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3305.12s)]
*  Caesar's, of course, crucial and the gravediggers and so on. But in the end, as Ambassador Reb [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3310.64s)]
*  mentioned and everyone actually in this chat mentioned, the Syrians have been wonderful in [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3316.72s)]
*  documenting almost everything. People would be documenting when the airplane is dropping bombs [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3323.52s)]
*  with a likelihood of 90% of them dying in that bomb and yet they were documenting everything. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3330.48s)]
*  In other words, we won't be struggling in finding evidence to prosecute the criminals. I think we'll [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3336.16s)]
*  be having challenge in getting the criminals to the court and that's where the role of the [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3341.6s)]
*  international community putting pressure on Russia and some Arab countries as well as in other [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3347.7599999999998s)]
*  countries that are hiding a lot of criminals. That's where powerful democratic countries [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3353.2s)]
*  around the world need to come to our support so we can actually prosecute them because otherwise [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3359.8399999999997s)]
*  the Syrian mothers and Syrian families will not settle, will not be able to move forward with [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3365.4399999999996s)]
*  their life. Thank you. Thank you, Ammar. Again, so powerful and thank you for the reminder of just [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3371.2s)]
*  how personal this is for you and for your family as well. We have about four minutes before we're [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3378.56s)]
*  out of time so I wanted to turn quickly to both Robert and to Stephen to sort of help us tie [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3386.56s)]
*  the discussion together by again maybe speaking about the role of the international community [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3397.04s)]
*  in general but especially what the AAAM could be doing in supporting accountability for [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3402.72s)]
*  the numerous violations we've seen across all sorts of categories. Again, all sorts of categories of [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3409.68s)]
*  protected persons and then maybe turn to you Stephen to talk about if you envision [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3415.6s)]
*  given shifting priorities in Washington and what sort of openings of space you see for [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3426.2400000000002s)]
*  what role may the U.S. government play in supporting this, why would it do so and what that could look [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3434.48s)]
*  like? I'll just turn it over to you both. Thanks, Alessandra. The AAAM can certainly play a role [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3442.2400000000002s)]
*  and I think criminal accountability certainly for those most responsible should play a role [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3450.0s)]
*  in transitional justice but it's only a small part of it but this is what we know how to do [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3454.16s)]
*  to build criminal cases. We have supported jurisdiction. We don't decide who gets [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3458.3999999999996s)]
*  investigated or prosecuted. We support jurisdictions who have as we will support [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3462.08s)]
*  Syrian and Syria who decides who they want to prosecute and for which crime. So we certainly [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3466.56s)]
*  have that role to play. I held in my own hands in December the Caesar files, the files with the [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3471.7599999999998s)]
*  pictures where I'll show the fake death certificate and the names and signatures of everyone involved. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3475.52s)]
*  That file, its use could be both but ultimately so judicial or non-judicial but ultimately what [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3480.88s)]
*  it does is that it does establish the truth and that's what the AAAM can help with. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3487.2000000000003s)]
*  Well let me just say first of all it's important one to lift the sanctions that were based upon [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3494.08s)]
*  the Assad regime. The Caesar Act which a lot of us were involved in passing based upon Caesar's [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3500.32s)]
*  evidence was focused on that regime and were very broad that included parts of the economy as well. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3505.36s)]
*  Those need to be lifted right away. No question about it. Now we have fortunately [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3512.96s)]
*  had a waiver of January 6th that NGOs can work on transitional justice processes and that work should [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3517.76s)]
*  go forward and states need to support the international community, need to support trusted NGOs [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3525.2000000000003s)]
*  to work with the government, with the IIM to bring out the kind of evidence that's absolutely [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3531.04s)]
*  essential for determining the truth and that will tell us not all but it'll tell us a lot of the [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3538.48s)]
*  story, the truth that I think is essential for there to be a foundation for transitional justice. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3544.2400000000002s)]
*  And then I think we the international community needs to engage with the government in terms of [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3551.6s)]
*  how those trials can be conducted consistent with Islamic law, consistent with international [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3557.36s)]
*  standards in a way that will ensure international cooperation. Many some high level fugitives have [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3563.28s)]
*  been caught. Some are I understand soon coming back from Iraq. Some have come back from from Lebanon. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3571.04s)]
*  There will be individuals that can be charged in the near future and tried in personam trials but [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3577.28s)]
*  there will be many individuals that have gone further away and it'll take international [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3583.84s)]
*  cooperation of the kind we've had with tribunals to get those countries to give up the suspects [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3587.76s)]
*  and it'll be essential in order to get those suspects on trial in Damascus that international [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3592.88s)]
*  standards are followed. I think the Syrian people demand that. They want fair justice. They don't [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3598.48s)]
*  want the crooked system. They want cases based on conduct and it's through that kind of process [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  with truth first prosecution of those that were responsible for horrendous conduct that I think [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3609.12s)]
*  we have a hope in Syria of a future of a peaceful and a country that serves the interests of all of [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3616.08s)]
*  its population. Thank you so much Stephen and thank to all of our panelists today as well as [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3623.3599999999997s)]
*  to everyone who's joined us. Clearly we've only scratched the surface of the many needs and [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3632.4s)]
*  challenges and opportunities Lina had. Unfortunately we're out of time for today so we will need to end [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3637.44s)]
*  the conversation here but I wanted to invite, well thank everybody again once again for joining us [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3644.96s)]
*  and invite those that are interested in this particular piece of the discussion to continue [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3650.8s)]
*  to follow our work. We will be sure to reconvene soon so that we can continue discussing this [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3656.88s)]
*  with more you know more in-depth developments on the ground continue to unfold. So thank you [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwM-9NCpgAI&t=3666.6400000000003s)]
