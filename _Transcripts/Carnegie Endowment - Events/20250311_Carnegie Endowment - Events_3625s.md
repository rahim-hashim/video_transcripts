Video Description: Is China imposing its will on the world, or is the reality more nuanced?  Many in the West, particularly in Washington, argue that China exerts global influence by disregarding local differences and imposing its own rules. But this view overlooks how Chinese engagement can accommodate local actors, adapting to their traditions, mindsets, and political landscapes.  Often, local players successfully influence Chinese interactions, shaping them to meet local expectations and demands.  How do they achieve this? What strategies are at play? 

China Local/Global, a multi-year Carnegie Asia program project, has been exploring these adaptive strategies, examining how Chinese actors respond to local partner demands across seven global regions. This crucial conversation focused on Central Asia—Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—will explore how local societies and governments in these five nations have successfully navigated their relationships with China. 

Please join the authors of several China Local/Global publications for a for a virtual discussion examining Central Asia’s strategic relations with China. Temur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, will moderate a discussion featuring Berikbol Dukeyev, a postdoctoral scholar at Nazarbayev University, Odil Gafarov, PhD candidate at Southern Illinois University, and Nargis Kassenova, senior fellow and director of the Program on Central Asia at Harvard University's Davis Center.

# Hard Power vs. Soft: China’s Evolving Role in Central Asia
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY)
*  Hello and welcome to an online event by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Timur Romarov. I'm a fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center based in Berlin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=12.0s)]
*  And today we are going to talk about China's evolving role in Central Asia. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=18.0s)]
*  So this event is a part of multi-year Carnegie Asia programs project that has been exploring China's adaptive strategies [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=27.0s)]
*  and examining how Chinese actors respond to local players, local partners demands across seven global regions. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=37.0s)]
*  And this event is focusing on one of those regions on Central Asia. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=46.0s)]
*  And I'm pleased and honored to be hosting this event with the great panel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=53.0s)]
*  First, we have Berikov Dukyev, who is a postdoctoral scholar at Nazarbayev University in Astana. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=61.0s)]
*  We also have Adil Gafarov, who is a PhD student in Southern Illinois University. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=71.0s)]
*  And then we have Nargiz Kasyanova, senior fellow and director of the program on Central Asia at Harvard's universities Davis Center. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=79.0s)]
*  Welcome all. Thank you so much for joining. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=88.0s)]
*  And I mean, China in Central Asia, there have been so many publications, events on this topic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=92.0s)]
*  And I think there is an infinite amount of discussions that one can have about this particular topic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=101.0s)]
*  But today we're going to be focusing on how China combines its hard and soft power and why in some countries hard power is possible in Central Asia and why in some countries it's not possible. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=109.0s)]
*  And the main key of that impossibility of using hard power by China in some of the countries is, of course, the nature of how China is becoming more adaptive to different countries. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=126.0s)]
*  But I wanted to start with Nargiz and you have published a piece with Carnegie's Asia Program, also under China Local Global Project, about how China is using the foreign aid, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=143.0s)]
*  how it's using different types of gift giving to win the hearts of Central Asian ruling elites. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=166.0s)]
*  And I wanted you to elaborate a little bit on that topic and give us a view about how this modern form of gift gifting and what kind of inter-elite relationship does it create and foster between China and Central Asia. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=175.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Timur. It's an honor and pleasure to be part of this panel and to present a little bit of the paper that I wrote for the Carnegie project on local global China. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=196.0s)]
*  Let me tell you a little bit about the origins of the paper. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=211.0s)]
*  Many years ago in 2008, I went to Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to study, kind of to look at the infrastructure projects, new infrastructure projects that were funded by Chinese concession loans, built by Chinese companies. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=216.0s)]
*  And that was a fairly new development in the region at the time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=236.0s)]
*  Nobody else had the money. China had the money. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=240.0s)]
*  It was giving these substantial loans to build roads, to build the grids and so on. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=242.0s)]
*  So I thought it was an interesting kind of an interesting development worth looking at. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=253.0s)]
*  So I went there, then I wrote a book, not a book, I wrote a paper and I sort of discussed China as an emerging donor in Central Asia and discussed the characteristics of these Chinese development assistance, how it's different from a kind of traditional Western development assistance, how it's part of the Chinese concession. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=259.0s)]
*  How it's part of the kind of China's rise. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=288.0s)]
*  I framed it as part of China's China's soft power and kind of talked about the ongoing geopolitical shift implications for the region and all that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=291.0s)]
*  So that's kind of the normal framing, normal story. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=304.0s)]
*  And then I wrote a bunch of papers on China's Belt and Road Initiative in the region. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=309.0s)]
*  So it was part of the same kind of the same frame. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=315.0s)]
*  Then during the pandemic in 2020, I was reading up on China Central Asia relations through the ages, and I came across a book, it's called Chinese World Order. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=318.0s)]
*  And it was a volume edited by by Harvard late historian, John Fermin. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=332.0s)]
*  And in this book, he and his colleagues, they were describing the relations between the Chinese Chinese court and neighbors through the ages. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=339.0s)]
*  And they kind of they frame these relations as as a tributary system. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=353.0s)]
*  Why tributary? Because it was based on kind of the set of ceremonies and norms and the well, kind of the rulers of these neighboring countries, they would go themselves or they will send envoys to the court. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=362.0s)]
*  They would bring tributes, presents, usually something some local local products. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=379.0s)]
*  And there will be a kind of very scripted ceremony and then the emperor will also kind of there will be a gift exchange. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=385.0s)]
*  So they will bring gifts that will receive gifts from the emperor. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=394.0s)]
*  And it was a very important ceremony, sort of setting up the order. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=397.0s)]
*  And with the kind of this China China centered China centered order, I wear kind of the emperor is at the top. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=405.0s)]
*  And then he's a benevolent kind of this benevolent, you know, maybe leader is not the right the right the right word, but kind of that's the centerpiece of the system. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=413.0s)]
*  Right. And then everybody else is attached through kind of through these tributes to to the to the emperor. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=425.0s)]
*  So that was the kind of the ideal normative normative order. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=433.0s)]
*  In reality, it didn't work this way. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=436.0s)]
*  So, you know, vessels sometimes they wouldn't be loyal. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=439.0s)]
*  So sometimes they wouldn't really consider themselves as kind of, you know, as vessels. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=442.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, kind of that that that wasn't normative normative order. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=449.0s)]
*  Similar to the current liberal world order. Right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=456.0s)]
*  It's also not not working exactly in kind of in line with all the principles and norms. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=458.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, there are these principles and norms that everybody kind of knows about. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=464.0s)]
*  And while I was reading it, kind of I had these pictures of the BRI forum, you know, in my head. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=470.0s)]
*  And I thought, OK, that's that's sort of the court. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=478.0s)]
*  And that's sort of this gift giving. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=481.0s)]
*  Maybe not exactly the gift exchange that you had in the past, but you have this benevolent benevolent kind of leader. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=483.0s)]
*  Right. The big, big, powerful country that considers to be very central. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=492.0s)]
*  Right. And that develops these relationships with the neighboring states. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=498.0s)]
*  But but but we know that it went much beyond. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=505.0s)]
*  So now it now it's it's it's global. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=508.0s)]
*  And I started thinking in this kind of, you know, in these terms and I think we see some patterns. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=512.0s)]
*  It's not exactly. Of course, it's not the same. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=520.0s)]
*  We don't have the tributary system that what what what happened in the past is in the past. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=522.0s)]
*  But but we do see the emergence of this kind of China, China centered world. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=527.0s)]
*  And definitely China's presented itself at this benevolent, benevolent power ready, ready to help. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=532.0s)]
*  So so that that's the idea, kind of with which I approached writing, writing, writing that paper. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=540.0s)]
*  And when you know, usually when you have a good idea, you start checking and you see that other scholars wrote something similar. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=550.0s)]
*  So I found that the Markowitz, Austin Strange and Dustin Tingly, they they use the idea of foreign aid and the kind of looked at what China did in the past and kind of the connected the present, the present and the past. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=558.0s)]
*  But I, you know, I think I contributed a little bit and I used centrally the case as a case. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=573.0s)]
*  Yeah, I seriously think that these parts of the relationship between China and Central Asia is seriously under researched. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=582.0s)]
*  And I think your paper sets the ground for many more, hopefully, researchers that we need to really understand what are the different dynamics and what are the different characteristics. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=590.0s)]
*  We will go back to this a little further during the Q&A. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=608.0s)]
*  But I wanted to turn to Bergboll now about and ask about the transition that we that we're seeing in China's approach in itself power in Central Asia. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=612.0s)]
*  And Nargis in her piece was focusing her attention mostly on the intra-elite relationship and exploring and explaining how China really cares about the relationship between its leadership and the leaderships in Central Asian countries. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=625.0s)]
*  But in your piece, you also start the piece from pointing out to this fact. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=646.0s)]
*  However, you also say that in Kazakhstan in the last last couple of years, we see the transition of China's focus to a broader people to people relationship. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=652.0s)]
*  How would you explain that? What had happened in the last several years that made China to go a little bit further from fostering the only inter-relationship to making its reputation better in the eyes of a broader population? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=664.0s)]
*  Yes, thank you so much, Timur. And I'm also very delighted to be part of this panel. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=688.0s)]
*  So continuing the Professor Kasianov's argumentation regarding this gift giving and intra-elite interactions between Central Asian countries, particularly Kazakhstan and China. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=694.0s)]
*  So those, as you mentioned, increasing people to people interactions is rather complementary of that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=708.0s)]
*  So it's not mutually exclusive and they are totally, I mean, the Chinese side, totally shifting towards the people to people interactions. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=715.0s)]
*  So in the last, I would say, yeah, it will be the almost more couple of years, plus minus, less than decade. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=723.0s)]
*  We see that despite those interactions between China and Kazakhstan, anti-China sentiments in Kazakhstan is not decreasing. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=734.0s)]
*  We see that from the public polls, although they sometimes show a bit pitchy and contradictory results. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=744.0s)]
*  But anyway, those, unlike other Central Asian countries in Kazakhstan, they're not decreasing. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=752.0s)]
*  And we see that that can be exemplified with, of course, the well-known cases of the nationwide protests that happened in 2016 regarding the land issue. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=758.0s)]
*  Also quite a bit before COVID, there was a protest regarding the establishment of the joint Kazakh-Chinese enterprises. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=773.0s)]
*  And during the COVID, it was applied of the ethnic Kazakhs in Xinjiang that also gathered a lot of media traction, as well as the created some sort of activism, both including specifically mainly by ethnic Kazakhs from Xinjiang and Kazakhstan. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=786.0s)]
*  So I guess all of these issues leads to for Beijing to focus towards the people to people interactions, as well as safeguarding the economic interests in Kazakhstan, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=806.0s)]
*  which is the economic investments in all spheres is among the highest across the Central Asian countries. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=828.0s)]
*  And I guess it also needs to be added that we see that such interactions from other Western countries has provided successful results. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=837.0s)]
*  For instance, for European Union, for the United States, or the mainly the Western countries. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=849.0s)]
*  Right. So that doesn't mean that those previous attempts what China has been doing in Kazakhstan or in any other part of the world, such as like the opening the Confucius Institute, like increasing the numbers of the those who are studying Chinese languages or culture, or the cultural efforts, all of that there. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=857.0s)]
*  But I guess the what we see in case of Kazakhstan is with regards to the more that the after the opening up the China following the COVID, we see that the efforts and the dynamism, as well as the number of initiatives is skyrocketed. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=883.0s)]
*  So I will talk more about that in the yeah, in more detail. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=907.0s)]
*  Would you also add to this list of the events that happened? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=913.0s)]
*  The massive protests that happened in Kazakhstan in January 2022, that also have changed the perception of Kazakhstan society in the eyes of decision makers in Beijing, or would you not add this to this list? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=920.0s)]
*  And also the second question, what are the, you know, examples? What are the efforts that China is taking to promote more positive perception of itself through media, cultural exchanges or tourism initiatives? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=939.0s)]
*  Right, yeah. So that's very good question regarding the January protests that occurred in 2022. It's totally I guess for the domestic audience. It was it was the sort of signaling within Kazakhstan that the role of China in the future, both for the elites and as well as for the population, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=956.0s)]
*  would increase and would be vital. And we see that it's not that Kazakhstan elite is not that united and not cohesive in terms of guaranteeing long term stability of Chinese investments. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=986.0s)]
*  So rather focusing on focusing on those people to people interactions in the long run would give more sustainable results to to China. And I guess we can look from that perspective. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1004.0s)]
*  And at the same time, so following those protests, the Kazakhstan president, Qasem Jomortov, have several time emphasized the role of China in terms of building and building those, I mean, more strengthening not only the economic relationship as Kazakhstan leadership has been focusing on the last 30 years, economy first and politics, but as well as the economic and economic [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1021.0s)]
*  And I guess we can look at the other types of the relationship, including the cultural ones. Right. So I guess Kazakhstan society is also understand that and makes the contribution towards that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1051.0s)]
*  So regarding the second part of your question on the what does those initiatives. So it's interesting to note that it's one of them is media. So we see that bilateral meetings between the regional leaders of media is has been increased so that has been attracting the opportunities in terms of making business with Chinese side and and learning how to do business in China and in China as well. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1068.0s)]
*  And that's been promoted by, interestingly, to note from the not only the media from the central part or the other parts of China, as well as presenting China's role, Xinjiang. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1097.0s)]
*  So we see that they try to emphasize the cultural affinities between Kazakhstan and Xinjiang, both of them Kazakh speaking, and they have the long, long ties of history and culture. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1112.0s)]
*  That's why we see the increase of movies or films, as well as a cultural events discussions in terms of the in terms of the like exhibitions and museums culture at those examples takes and such meetings at the high level has been increased recently. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1126.0s)]
*  And it should be noted that Kazakhstan is is also taking this own stance and the propelding the propelding the way the details of such events and I guess towards more more focusing in terms of more on the bilateralism of such events and the interactions. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1147.0s)]
*  Thank you, Bergbo. After reading your piece on China's soft power in Kazakhstan, I've been listening to Dimash Kudaibergen's songs for several days and I should say that I understand why some people get captivated by his voice. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1172.0s)]
*  Let's move on from soft to hard power. There are, as you write in your piece, boots on the ground. There are boots on the ground of some Chinese private security companies in Central Asia. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1196.0s)]
*  And my question is, why do we see the PSCs in some countries Central Asia and in some countries we don't? What are the drivers drivers of growth of those companies being present in Central Asia? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1219.0s)]
*  Thank you, Dimur. I think the phenomenon of private security companies in Chinese foreign policy is, you know, overall pattern not only that exists not only in Central Asia, but overall in where China, you know, invests its in infrastructure projects. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1239.0s)]
*  And while the private security in China have existed long before starting from opening up policies, but those companies were mainly bodyguarding companies that protected the offices of international organizations, embassies in mainland China. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1261.0s)]
*  Two main factors that significantly influenced the expansion of these so-called private security companies abroad. The first one is the go out policy and the second one is Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1281.0s)]
*  Well, as you may know, at the beginning of early 2000s, Chinese government encouraged Chinese business, specifically state owned enterprises to go abroad and invest there. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1301.0s)]
*  And because of that, more than a million Chinese nationals started working abroad. And some of these projects were invested in the countries with a very volatile and unstable political life and security. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1314.0s)]
*  And of course, there were attacks on Chinese assets and Chinese nationals, but not only in, you know, unstable regions, the attacks happened in stable regions too. So China had to do something. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1337.0s)]
*  And by that time, there was ongoing reformation of People's Liberation Army. By that time, it was, as you remember, it was three million people. And then the Chinese government just cut million people from three million to two million people. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1357.0s)]
*  And you have more than a million people unemployed and private security sector was a very good place to go, of course. And with the Belt and Road, the number of projects has increased significantly. Of course, this created a niche for some people and also demand. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1373.0s)]
*  So there have been severe attacks on Chinese nationals and they were ongoing debates in Chinese society what to do at the beginning. Chinese state-owned enterprises tried to hire Western private security companies, British, South African, Australian companies to work with. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1394.0s)]
*  They soon realized that they have a lot of problems with them. First of all, language barrier. Second, you know, the sensitive information, especially to R&D information and so forth, and overall cultural problems with among the Westerners and Chinese. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1414.0s)]
*  And they soon realized that they need to create their own companies to protect their own people. And again, this was also demand from the bottoms to the authorities. So yeah, they started creating their own companies. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1431.0s)]
*  I'm telling you so far the conventional theory of how they were created. There are some speculations, especially military experts that say that their main purpose, the main purpose of these companies is actually to project Chinese power abroad. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1451.0s)]
*  I will talk about it later on. So far, so to factors, China's go out policy and Belt and Road Initiative. Well, then I need to say that they arrived in Central Asian region very late. They first, of course, they were in Africa, then Southeast Asia, and then in Central Asia. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1471.0s)]
*  There are, there were some attacks on Chinese businesses and nationals in Central Asian region, specifically in Kyrgyzstan, for example, in 2014, 2019. There was, you know, clashes between Chinese workers and locals. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1496.0s)]
*  And also there was an attack on the Chinese embassy in Bishkek in 2016, and numerous anti-China protests overall in the Central Asian region, not only in Kyrgyzstan. So of course, this created a demand. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1518.0s)]
*  You know, if you try to see at the situation from a Chinese business perspective, you can see that at some point they were disappointed with the previous policies that they, that they proceeded. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1537.0s)]
*  Here I wanted to just a little bit add to what said Professor Kassenow and a bit of both about the, you know, this soft power relationship between local elites and in Chinese authorities. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1552.0s)]
*  Chinese authorities faced the situation when there was nobody to talk to. There was literally nobody. What if, what if the, what if the attention, specific Central Asian country was, you know, overrun by the protesters or unrest, civil unrest, and so forth. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1568.0s)]
*  So what to do in this situation? They had to outsource for some other, some other resources. And that's, that's how they started, you know, deploying private security companies in Central Asian region, starting from 2016, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1591.0s)]
*  So again, demand, of course, not only economic, but also political demand in the region created this demand for Chinese authorities to deploy them. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1611.0s)]
*  And I will also would like to mention that the term private security company is kind of number in the Chinese sense, because all this, they're not really private. Like even the Chinese term for, for this company is it's, it doesn't, it doesn't say that it's private. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1624.0s)]
*  It's private, like it's San Bao Gong, which literally says security company in all Chinese, you know, first of all, this is specific of Chinese language. They don't use that. But again, I think this is, this is those little things that China, you know, the Chinese language has that everybody knows that they are not really private. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1644.0s)]
*  So they're a security company kind of same people, the boots on the ground, but with the different labor employment contract status. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1663.0s)]
*  Yes, I think we can go and talk about the nuances of Chinese language for another couple of hours, actually, maybe even even more. But I completely agree with you that sometimes the translations of specific terminology can kind of change the way that the Chinese language is used. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1674.0s)]
*  It can kind of change the perception of specific Chinese activities or Chinese political kind of actions in different parts of the world. But you know, what can we do with that? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1703.0s)]
*  So, Sean, as I understand you correctly, the nightmare scenario for Beijing in Central Asia would be that they will not have a contact with the leadership and that they will be left in the unknown about what are the, you know, what is the agenda of Central Asian political leadership, not only towards China, but also in their domestic policies, considering that [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1722.0s)]
*  Central Asia is very important part of the world for China's Western provinces for Xinjiang and from the Beijing's perspective, stability in Xinjiang is very much tied to the stability in Central Asia. So would you say that that's the main kind of point of China's being so actively present in security of Central Asian countries? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1749.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course, of course. Well, here, well, the issue of Xinjiang is one of the most important, of course, for the Chinese authorities now, especially after the, you know, what was going on in recent years in Xinjiang. But I also want to pay attention to two things that has changed China's policy in Central Asian region. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1778.0s)]
*  Two things. Well, first of all, January 2022, political unrest in Kazakhstan and February 2022, Russian full scale invasion of Ukraine. And as a result, Russia was, you know, destructed on its Western side. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1806.0s)]
*  And it was kind of created this condition for China to be more active in a security sense. There are two main fractions among Chinese elites that we can see when it comes to Central Asia. The first fraction and its majority one is the fraction of diplomats, those or peacemakers, those who state that China is [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1825.0s)]
*  must strengthen them, give them everything, what they, you know, what they can do in order to protect Chinese interests, economic interests in the region. So work working with local authorities, local police, local military, and so forth to, you know, to make sure that there is a steady, steady balance between the two. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1847.0s)]
*  But there's also the second fraction of so-called hawks that say that there's there's nothing to rely on Central Asia, that China needs to have boots on the ground, that China needs to have some means to protect its people. And this is an ongoing debate. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1868.0s)]
*  And this is an ongoing debate for at least the last 20 years. And both sides have published tons of papers, academic papers in Chinese. I'm pretty sure that you saw some of them in that, especially from the second fraction that is coming out in the next few months. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1884.0s)]
*  And after 2022, since like the second fraction kind of started seeing that, okay, the diplomacy is kind of not working, maybe we need to do something about it. And then the second fraction, the second fraction, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1906.0s)]
*  of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese, the second fraction of Chinese. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1936.0s)]
*  much shocked and surprised by what happened in Kazakhstan in January 2022 [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1959.84s)]
*  and that they did not they realized that they did not understand the region well [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1964.72s)]
*  that not that well as they thought or if they wanted and this again creates this [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1970.4199999999998s)]
*  demand for you know increasing this security policy in Central Asia and as [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1976.56s)]
*  a result we can see that a lot of different security organizations in [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1984.6s)]
*  China now are interested in investing in Central Asian region especially with the [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1990.6s)]
*  with the countries where such you know unrest potential may exist and this are [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=1997.9599999999998s)]
*  not just private security companies as we as we see now first of all it's a [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2003.8799999999999s)]
*  It's the People's Armed Police and then Ministry of Public Security so PAP, MPS [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2011.7s)]
*  and PSCs are the three main sources three main tools what the Chinese [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2020.9s)]
*  government is actually now trying to use in order to leverage its security [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2027.82s)]
*  interests in Central Asia as you see China is using kind of like a police [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2032.3s)]
*  force in this this also means that they are mostly interested in first of all [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2039.14s)]
*  securing their Xinjiang province because well Xinjiang province is kind of you [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2047.0200000000002s)]
*  know related to the the police authority not the military authority and Chinese [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2053.1s)]
*  So yeah this is this is continuing of China's domestic policy that now goes to [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2059.18s)]
*  Central Asian region. Yeah in a way it expands its security [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2069.18s)]
*  apparatus from within to also cover at least the neighboring regions. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2076.4199999999996s)]
*  Thank you very much Odeo. I want to go back to Nargis but before I do I want to [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2082.2599999999998s)]

*  on YouTube leave a comment if you have a question ask it in the comment [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2093.98s)]
*  section as well. First Nargis I wanted to ask you whether or not you agree with [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2098.3s)]
*  Odeo about his take on the fact that January 2022 the Khande Khandar has [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2107.9s)]
*  changed completely the mindset of people in Beijing about their approach to [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2116.42s)]
*  Central Asia about their presence and security in Central Asia and then I [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2123.3s)]
*  would want to go to the question from the audience I will paraphrase it a [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2128.6600000000003s)]
*  little bit the question is about the growth of debt obligations that Central [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2134.82s)]
*  Asian countries have towards China and if I understand the question correctly [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2144.06s)]
*  it says whether or not these obligations are you know big enough or [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2150.94s)]
*  significant enough that we should take them into consideration where when [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2159.46s)]
*  analyzing the situation in Central Asia. So Mike goes to you. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2167.18s)]
*  Thank you very much. First on the security front and the Khande Khandar events [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2176.14s)]
*  I think the Chinese policymakers like everybody else found this [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2183.06s)]
*  impressive and you know kind of unexpected but I would think that well [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2191.5s)]
*  first it's not the first political upheaval in the region right so the [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2200.94s)]
*  kind of they saw what happened in Kyrgyzstan several times right and they [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2205.26s)]
*  kind of so I think there is understanding that things like that can [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2208.98s)]
*  happen in the region but probably Kazakhstan was more surprising because [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2212.92s)]
*  it's the most kind of established and the richest country in the region [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2218.62s)]
*  development kind of institutions apparatus security apparatus and all [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2225.5s)]
*  that so I think it made an impression I think February Russia's invasion full [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2232.82s)]
*  scale invasion of Ukraine made an even bigger impression on Beijing so kind of [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2240.46s)]
*  probably the perceptions of the kind of of security in security and stability [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2247.1s)]
*  in Eurasia at large changed right but I wouldn't tie it so kind of so much [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2253.02s)]
*  with the global security initiative adopted in April 2022 I think it is [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2261.98s)]
*  global it is global so and it's part of the overall China's security expansion [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2271.2999999999997s)]
*  right like a base in Djibouti and like more security cooperation well PLA doing [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2278.1s)]
*  more exercises you know with partners PAP also doing international cooperation [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2288.3799999999997s)]
*  so that precedes 2022 and I think that's sort of the formulation so Xi Jinping [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2298.86s)]
*  came up with all these global global initiatives right development security [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2305.78s)]
*  civilization so kind of so I would agree that it made an impression but I would [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2310.42s)]
*  not tie it with there with the global global security unveiling of global [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2317.6200000000003s)]
*  initiative and it seems to me that it's super interesting what Adil said about [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2323.74s)]
*  these two factions and I'm so envious of you Chinese speakers who can kind of [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2331.3399999999997s)]
*  really trace these debates and in in China but it seems to me that would be [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2336.66s)]
*  impossible to have one without the other to have the second thing without the [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2343.74s)]
*  first thing because you need to have this government to government cooperation [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2347.62s)]
*  that's the base yeah and then you can do everything else so you cannot have [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2351.7s)]
*  security private security companies without having kind of you know PAP [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2356.94s)]
*  cooperation PLA cooperation with with the counterparts in in in in the region the [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2365.62s)]
*  the question very well the question about that well definitely it needs to [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2373.54s)]
*  be taken into account the indebtedness especially Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2381.02s)]
*  heavily indebted to to China to Chinese Chinese Exim Bank and now there are new [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2385.54s)]
*  projects right that are being developed and there is more Chinese Chinese [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2391.1s)]
*  funding so of course that's that's a big that's a big factor but I don't think [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2396.06s)]
*  they cannot work in the region you know we would be with these debts but and [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2399.78s)]
*  there are other factors apart from the debt it's the business environment and [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2405.42s)]
*  you know kind of the level of corruption and and all that that kind of need to be [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2408.82s)]
*  taken into into account if you want to invest invest in the region want to work [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2414.6200000000003s)]
*  with the with the region well Timur there was a question about political the [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2419.6200000000003s)]
*  kind of yes it was China's direct influence on the alignment of political [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2426.26s)]
*  very interesting question I and well I would say not yet and non-interference [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2436.7400000000002s)]
*  in domestic affairs that's that's one of the principles of Chinese foreign [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2445.54s)]
*  policy one of the five principles of Chinese foreign policy and I think they [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2451.02s)]
*  they abide by it and and basically what we see in the paper I kind of describe [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2454.86s)]
*  the adaptation to to a succession of Kyrgyz leaders right that the kind of [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2464.22s)]
*  they would develop relationship with the particular leader the leader is gone they [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2474.4199999999996s)]
*  develop relationship with a new leader and it's interesting to see that kind of [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2479.62s)]
*  the leadership also they kind of the elites adapt if prior to taking the [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2484.4599999999996s)]
*  they might have they might have some kind of express anti-Chinese anti-Chinese [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2490.14s)]
*  sentiments once they are in power there's a very clear understanding and [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2497.9s)]
*  recognition the role of China kind of the usefulness of China so they [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2502.1s)]
*  immediately start the start cooperating cooperating with with China so it's [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2507.74s)]
*  basically it's very structural in this in this regard so I would say no that's [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2512.68s)]
*  the last frontier the non-interference in political affairs but kind of they're [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2519.64s)]
*  watching what's going on and they are not doing what the Westerners are doing [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2525.6s)]
*  in a sense that kind of meeting with the opposition with kind of looking at [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2530.2s)]
*  different players working with the NGOs with media and and and so on they're [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2536.2799999999997s)]
*  very kind of you know focused there are these people-to-people relations but [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2542.4s)]
*  that's not political that's how yeah the situation yeah I would say that in a way [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2546.7999999999997s)]
*  China's presence or China's significant significance in Central Asia is a kind [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2554.7999999999997s)]
*  of a matter of fact and no matter who is in power they will have to have not [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2561.12s)]
*  only some sort of relationship with China but a very good relationship so [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2567.12s)]
*  that they can rely on China at least in economic dimension and can I add in [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2570.8399999999997s)]
*  political although there is no experience I would say now China [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2579.4s)]
*  provides this political umbrella for Central Asian Central Asian states so [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2584.6s)]
*  it's so important that China you know keeps repeating that we support the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2590.88s)]
*  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Central Asian states without providing [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2597.2799999999997s)]
*  security guarantees obviously right but it's important that they keep saying [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2602.2s)]
*  that and it's more important than ever talking about sovereignty we have a [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2606.44s)]
*  second question about a competition between Russia and China in Central [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2612.7999999999997s)]
*  Asia for influence I want to ask this question to Odile what do you think [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2617.7999999999997s)]
*  about whether or not this competition really exists especially in the regional [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2626.16s)]
*  security thank you very much it's actually very hard to answer unless you [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2633.3599999999997s)]
*  do not have a you know a big number of insights into what's going on between [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2638.66s)]
*  you know this these agencies whether it is really a competition or not it's [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2645.2599999999998s)]
*  hard to say I can only share my own perspective and my own experience with [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2650.02s)]
*  the region again I might be wrong but since like it's both because in some [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2655.2s)]
*  cases China is actually probably competing with Russia but in some other [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2661.18s)]
*  cases they are coordinating their actions so the the increasing the [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2667.62s)]
*  increase of Chinese security presence in Central Asia I don't think it's it was [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2674.46s)]
*  you know not agreed with the with the Kremlin I think just Russians didn't [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2678.86s)]
*  really you know didn't say anything so it's it's very complicated relations [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2687.54s)]
*  between these two great powers but again I think you wrote very good piece [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2695.32s)]
*  on this very recently where you also mentioned that there's also role of [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2700.6400000000003s)]
*  Central Asian countries we shouldn't forget it's just not just you know Russia [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2707.84s)]
*  and in China in the region as many Western analysts write in their papers [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2712.04s)]
*  and they totally forget about the agency of Central Asian states it's it's the [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2718.2400000000002s)]
*  Central Asian states that are also trying to make compete them and cooperate [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2725.0s)]
*  them at the same time so yes the the Chinese presence is increasing and it's [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2729.6s)]
*  backed up by money a lot of money but you but again what I saw at least in [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2736.4s)]
*  what I what I think China is still not a match with Russia so far because well [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2742.92s)]
*  there's more than 100 years of you know common history with Russia and Central [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2752.16s)]
*  Asia and for Central Asians as I as I know speak with them local Central Asian [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2756.2s)]
*  authorities local military people security people I know that they say [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2764.24s)]
*  that Russians are at least predictable we know Russian mentality we understand [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2767.92s)]
*  them we know how to talk with them we know what to expect it's very difficult [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2772.88s)]
*  with Chinese where there's not much in common in culture and language in you [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2777.3599999999997s)]
*  know history and so forth so it's not really easy thing to predict and to [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2782.12s)]
*  cooperate with them there is a cooperation but it's not as close as [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2787.48s)]
*  with Russians and there's one you know small example that I can provide is that [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2792.2799999999997s)]
*  you know if you're just imagine if you're a representative of Chinese state [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2799.3599999999997s)]
*  authority I don't know the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2805.68s)]
*  Ministry of Public Security or more ministry of State Security it's one [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2811.12s)]
*  thing but it's another thing if you are representative of FSB FS FS these badge [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2817.64s)]
*  actually open so many doors in Central Asia and it's not really comparable with [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2824.7599999999998s)]
*  NSS or NPS it's much much easier for them to talk and most of these people [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2830.56s)]
*  both from Central Asia and Russia they studied at the same places same [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2836.4399999999996s)]
*  academies or they you know the same training centers and so forth so it's [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2840.9199999999996s)]
*  much more in common among the Russians and Central Asians than so far with with [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2846.2799999999997s)]
*  Chinese and Central Asians so again yeah there is a competition but there's also [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2852.7999999999997s)]
*  cooperation and if there is a competition I would say that Russia is still prevailing [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2857.0s)]
*  yes I would I would agree with you on that we have a third question I would [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2862.5600000000004s)]
*  ask it to Berykpul if I may did Kazakhstan have some leverage to cut [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2870.44s)]
*  out better deals between them and the Chinese government as compared to [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2876.88s)]
*  Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan due to having greater natural resources and political [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2880.7200000000003s)]
*  stability would you agree that this is the case I would say rather partially so [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2885.24s)]
*  if we compare Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan there might be then yes there might be [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2893.52s)]
*  some sort of a deals like in terms of statistics we can see that at least in [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2899.72s)]
*  terms of available statistics we can see in terms of loan and credits those [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2904.8799999999997s)]
*  countries are more dependent on China rather than for instance Kazakhstan but [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2909.28s)]
*  at the same time yeah in terms of the same about the natural resources export [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2915.4s)]
*  to China that we see as well as Kazakhstan might have and also the [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2920.48s)]
*  sharing the direct and long border with Xinjiang that might give some sort of a [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2926.2400000000002s)]
*  leverage and get some consensus from China but at the same time as we I guess [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2933.7599999999998s)]
*  more or less sort of discussed today that the expectedly stable country as [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2940.68s)]
*  Kazakhstan has no longer that has that image in the mindset of I don't know [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2949.92s)]
*  Beijing officials or anyone else at the same time with the effect of the [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2957.12s)]
*  sanctions on Russia and Kazakhstan being part of the original economic Union at [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2962.68s)]
*  the same time at the same time the economic situation is like economic gap [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2968.48s)]
*  is increasing in Kazakhstan so there are a lot of domestic issues that come under [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2975.96s)]
*  the surface following the like 30 years of development of more than 30 years of [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2981.2s)]
*  of the independence of Kazakhstan and of course in all of that there is [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2988.04s)]
*  interrelated contention and I don't know for five years for scumming elections in [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2993.0s)]
*  Kazakhstan all of that makes the issue of the political stability is no longer [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=2997.96s)]
*  applicable to Kazakhstan and at the same time I guess we also have to discuss in [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3005.7599999999998s)]
*  response to this question whether we are whether we are only discussing what's [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3013.76s)]
*  available in terms of bilateral trades and investments but also the hidden [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3018.8s)]
*  loans and hidden investments and as perhaps it's available on the news that [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3024.6800000000003s)]
*  we don't know exactly for instance how much Kazakhstan gets out of these joint [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3032.44s)]
*  enterprises exactly right so all the what's the impact in terms of to the [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3038.96s)]
*  environment how the how the domestic how the people who live in the regions where [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3044.28s)]
*  those enterprises or investments have been opened and functioning and [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3050.36s)]
*  benefiting from that so there are a lot of open questions whether that questions [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3055.08s)]
*  are I'm not sure whether that questions been on the table while Kazakh and the [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3061.0s)]
*  making those agreements and that's why that's why that is at least from my [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3066.2000000000003s)]
*  understanding it makes that it makes the sense that Kazakhstan is more [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3075.7200000000003s)]
*  dependable than China but if you compare Uzbekistan yeah there are some [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3082.44s)]
*  partial partial truth to that yeah we should wrap up soon but before we go we [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3089.4s)]
*  still have two questions and I would ask Nargis and Odil to be concise since [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3097.08s)]
*  we're talking about money and very big we'll started this discussion already [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3105.92s)]
*  my colleague Mike Nelson is asking about the role of corruption in Central [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3113.0s)]
*  Asia and Nargis what do you think whether Chinese money has made things [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3119.16s)]
*  worse with corruption in Central Asia well unfortunately the role of corruption [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3124.04s)]
*  is considerable well if you compare Western business people and Chinese [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3130.7599999999998s)]
*  business people Western business people are on the more constraints due to [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3140.0s)]
*  domestic legislation trying to limit corruption than Chinese business [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3145.9s)]
*  business people but but of course now the Trump administration has posed the [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3152.1s)]
*  foreign corrupt practices I think that's how it's called act in order to increase [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3157.2200000000003s)]
*  the competitiveness of American American companies in the world so so of course [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3163.5s)]
*  it kind of it feeds corruption but but Chinese money is not the only money [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3171.3s)]
*  that that feeds corruption they have been a number of scandals with Western [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3175.1000000000004s)]
*  companies the kind of the the ground is you know sort of fertile and the [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3180.3s)]
*  Kazakhstan has been trying to address this issue by making an enclave with the [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3189.6200000000003s)]
*  based on common law at the Astana International Finance Finance Center so [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3195.6600000000003s)]
*  the situation is better and there have been some some measures but but you know [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3200.62s)]
*  that they kind of we do have the problem I would can following up on what a deal [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3205.18s)]
*  a deal said I think it's kind of Russia that feeds corruption much more it's [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3210.98s)]
*  much more entrenched entrenched there and it's kind of it's more hidden it's more [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3217.94s)]
*  hidden at the same time because you know Chinese investments Chinese projects [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3225.02s)]
*  attract a lot of attention so there is kind of maybe not on purpose transparency [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3229.7799999999997s)]
*  but but but you know kind of when something happens immediately there is [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3234.58s)]
*  attention like these this legislation that the the protests that Barry Ball [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3238.46s)]
*  mentioned right the the land protests in 2016 right people went into the streets [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3244.9s)]
*  because they thought that these are Chinese companies who will be renting [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3250.54s)]
*  renting Kazakh land and then it turned out that that Russians you know read much [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3253.34s)]
*  more land in Kazakhstan and nobody was aware about it you know until until the [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3259.94s)]
*  process so I would say the kind of it's Russia we should look to and all these [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3264.62s)]
*  very kind of dense connections between individuals and and and groups so yeah [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3268.82s)]
*  let me stop here thank you or deal the last question goes to you and the [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3276.18s)]
*  question is about the Shanghai Corporation organizations role in I guess [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3283.9s)]
*  security activities of China in Central Asia but maybe a little more than that [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3289.3s)]
*  sure well there's the same Shanghai Corporation organizations still you know [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3296.5s)]
*  plays a certain role in Central Asian region but it's because of the old [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3304.46s)]
*  mechanisms that you know existed early 2010 the you know regional [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3311.86s)]
*  anti-terrorist structure training exercises between SEO member states I [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3320.62s)]
*  think the last one was in two and 2023 and and there is it is expected that the [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3329.82s)]
*  will be in Belarus in 2025 July if I'm not mistaken so there is still ongoing [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3337.3399999999997s)]
*  kind of training but again my subjective personal opinion is that I think the [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3341.8999999999996s)]
*  original central Shanghai Corporation organization it died in 2019 like the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3350.3399999999997s)]
*  SEO that we have now is this something new it's not the SEO that we used to [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3356.8199999999997s)]
*  know it's not the SEO that was created in 2001 because the the functions of [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3362.94s)]
*  organization has changed it have changed seriously it's not a security [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3368.1800000000003s)]
*  organization anymore and maybe it's not even a economy cooperation organization [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3377.02s)]
*  because if we do a simple data analysis and data comparison of the consensus [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3382.02s)]
*  points that were made in joint communicates and simply calculate them [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3391.38s)]
*  we'll see that you know there's these dynamics starting from 2001 70% of [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3397.1s)]
*  common agreements were on security so we can conclude okay the security was the [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3404.1s)]
*  most important thing for member states but then it started kind of you know [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3408.76s)]
*  shifting and by 2017 it was 50-50 so security from one side and economic [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3412.82s)]
*  cooperation from another side then from 2017 to 2019 it was mostly comic [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3421.1s)]
*  cooperation agreements but after that after 2019 we see more agreements on the [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3427.3399999999997s)]
*  the the third topics culture use development traditional medicine that [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3435.86s)]
*  kind of stuff that that is there was not really much important for SEO at the [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3443.62s)]
*  beginning so it's now it's very different organization with a big number [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3448.3s)]
*  of members and co-members you know the affiliated companies affiliated states [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3454.0600000000004s)]
*  so again it's it's a very different organization now in China Chinese [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3461.5s)]
*  authorities they're kind of disappointed with the SEO structures that's why they [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3467.9s)]
*  started doing their own stuff because they tied arguing with Russia on a lot [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3471.94s)]
*  of stuff and they also tied off arguing with India I've personally seen this [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3477.94s)]
*  arguments as you may know I was affiliated with the Shanghai Corporation [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3484.26s)]
*  organization when I was in Beijing and I had an opportunity to present in some of [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3489.3s)]
*  these meetings in the Secretariat of the Shanghai Corporation organization and I [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3495.5s)]
*  had a you know opportunity to talk to the official representative of these [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3498.86s)]
*  countries and I asked this you know uncomfortable questions especially to [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3503.7s)]
*  Indian side which was literally dumping all of the initiative security economy [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3507.74s)]
*  doesn't matter and I asked them like why you're doing this like we're we're [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3514.66s)]
*  succeeding so much why you're dumping and and his answer was I mean it was very [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3518.46s)]
*  brutal but also very realistic he said you know Uzbekistan was the country [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3524.66s)]
*  that used to dump all of those statements you know earlier before and [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3530.22s)]
*  the organization survived so now Uzbekistan is the most active member of [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3535.18s)]
*  the Shanghai Corporation organization but we're like kind of doing the same [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3540.62s)]
*  stuff we'll be okay like we will think about our own national interests first [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3544.8599999999997s)]
*  so this was a very strong and compelling answer to me that now the [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3549.7799999999997s)]
*  organization is dominated by the national interests of you know every [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3557.9s)]
*  specific state and because of that it will not be as successful as we want it [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3562.3s)]
*  so again yes the mechanism still work but they're old mechanisms [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3567.58s)]
*  the new mechanisms are well there's no there's nothing new so yeah [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3573.3s)]
*  thank you Adil on that note unfortunately we'll have to end our [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPe2xuWSUY&t=3579.38s)]
