The United States took unprecedented action, striking three nuclear sites on June 22, following an ongoing campaign of Israeli attacks on Iranian leadership, nuclear, and energy targets. Iran responded to Israel with a barrage of ballistic missile strikes, but following the latest U.S. bombing, Tehran attacked with a reportedly well-telegraphed symbolic strike on American assets in Qatar.  
For now, it seems the dangerous escalatory cycle has been diffused, but how long will this uneasy status quo endure without a negotiated set of arrangements that satisfies all three parties in this explosive triangle?  Are Israeli and U.S. interests aligned? What kind of concessions is Iran prepared to make on their nuclear program? Is a diplomatic solution possible and, if not, what kind of conflict lies ahead? 
Join Aaron David Miller as he sits down with Amos Yadlin, president and founder of MIND and former head of IDF Intelligence, and the Carnegie Endowment’s Karim Sadjadpour to discuss these and other issues on the next Carnegie Connects.

# The U.S., Iran and Israel: Can Crisis be Turned Into Opportunity?
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI)
*  Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you are in this world of ours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=0.0s)]
*  I truly hope you are safe and have all taken good care. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=15.58s)]
*  The Mayor and David Miller, our Senior Fellow at Carnegie, and Donman Center at Houston, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=19.76s)]
*  welcome to the party. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=24.16s)]
*  A series of conversations about issues critical to America and to the world. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=26.16s)]
*  Lenin famously said that there are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=32.08s)]
*  when decades pass. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=40.16s)]
*  I generally don't believe in transformation, game changers, and section 20. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=42.08s)]
*  I've been learning that for quite a long time, where in effect, more often than not, ideas [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=47.48s)]
*  on war-making and peacemaking go to die. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=53.8s)]
*  On this point, I'm prepared to do a Samuel Taylor collage, and really need to spend my [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=58.08s)]
*  just a week. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=64.08s)]
*  What we've watched over the last few weeks is really quite remarkable and extraordinary. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=65.08s)]
*  The events of the past few weeks, where we are now and where we go from here, though, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=71.28s)]
*  have to be done in a sober and clear-eyed fashion. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=76.56s)]
*  I don't have to deal with any of these issues today, but I have to guess today that I can. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=83.36s)]
*  And I count on them both for extraordinary analysis and balance and objectives. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=90.28s)]
*  Let me introduce you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=98.64s)]
*  After General retired, Amos Yaglin was the president and founder of Mind Israel, an action-oriented [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=100.84s)]
*  non-profit consulting group providing the Israelis with a national security issue. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=107.76s)]
*  He served as the head of Israel's defense and public income, former deputy commander [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  of the Israeli Air Force, and IDF defense assistant in Washington. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  Kareem said before, my friend and colleague in Carnegie, as a senior fellow here where [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=125.4s)]
*  he focuses on Iran, U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=130.52s)]
*  I count on Kareem always for the most insightful, nuanced, and perceptive analysis, not just [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  on Iran, but in the broader Middle East. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=147.16s)]
*  Amos, first of all, welcome Amos and Kareem to you, the Carnegie Connects. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=149.72s)]
*  Amos, let me ask you a very simple question. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=156.24s)]
*  Why now? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=160.68s)]
*  Was this a war of necessity or a war of choice? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=163.2s)]
*  It was a preemptive war to prevent Iran destroying Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=168.8s)]
*  We saw two advancements in the Iranian weapons. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  One on the nuclear issue. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=184.0s)]
*  For the first time, weaponization activities have started, not by order of the Supreme [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=186.68s)]
*  Leader. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=194.8s)]
*  He hasn't changed the fatwa yet, but bottom up, a lot of activities were done basically [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=195.8s)]
*  towards going to the Supreme Leader and ask to change the fatwa that we never believed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=205.28s)]
*  that this is serious. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=211.6s)]
*  And second, a plan to produce another 6,000 ballistic missiles in the coming two years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  And speaking about destroying Israel with barrage of 1,000 ballistic missiles every [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  day and destroying everything in Israel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  And this was in a way a combination of the Begin Doctrine, which is always a preemptive [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  move, because the Begin Doctrine is saying that if a country that calls for the destruction [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=252.68s)]
*  of Israel is developing the ultimate weapon to do it, Israel will try to do everything [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=260.4s)]
*  that a nuclear bomb will not be in the hands of somebody who calls to destroy Israel. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=268.88s)]
*  And also the 7th of October. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=276.4s)]
*  7th of October was the conventional version of destroying Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=278.4s)]
*  And Iran was behind it with all its proxies. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=283.68s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, the Shia militia in Iraq, the Assad regime. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=288.28s)]
*  And it was about time to go to the head of the octopus. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=295.84s)]
*  And it was time to use that Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=301.88s)]
*  drones in April 2024 and in October. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=310.24s)]
*  So this was really a preemptive, strategic preemptive. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=317.72s)]
*  You can call it war. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=324.0s)]
*  You can call it a campaign. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=325.0s)]
*  But it was needed and right in time before it's too late. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  Let me quote from something you wrote in the New York Times. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  You write that Iran was swiftly approaching the threshold of an unstoppable weaponized [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=341.28s)]
*  nuclear capacity. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=346.92s)]
*  Just want to drill down on that a bit. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=349.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Eyal Barak talked about a zone of immunity. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=354.44s)]
*  A zone of immunity in which the Israelis, not the Americans necessarily, the Israelis [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=359.32s)]
*  would not be in a position to fundamentally degrade or destroy Iran's nuclear weapons [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=363.88s)]
*  aspirations or ability. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  Was Iran a nuclear threshold state in your view? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=376.2s)]
*  It possessed all of the elements required to make a weapon and the only thing that was [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=380.4s)]
*  missing was a political decision to do so? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=388.28s)]
*  When Eyal Barak spoke about zone of immunity, it was 15 years ago. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  And he referred to the enrichment part of the program that at that time they put it [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  in Fordow. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  And Fordow seems like a place that you cannot destroy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=410.24s)]
*  So this is immunity. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  A lot of water went through in the Jordan River and the Potomac River since 15 years [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  ago. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=424.84s)]
*  The Iranians are with capability to enrich uranium beyond a stoppable point. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=425.84s)]
*  That was the assumption in Israel in the last year. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=434.68s)]
*  And when we saw that they are advancing, the only missing part, which is weaponization, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  the decision was made. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  I think the head of the CIA, Ratcliffe said it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=450.76000000000005s)]
*  They were like a football player in front of the goal and no goaler and they only have [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=454.0s)]
*  to kick the ball. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=465.64s)]
*  So Israel will not allow it to happen. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=468.32s)]
*  One last question before we go to Karim to talk about the Iranian response to you, Amos. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=473.68s)]
*  The Israeli activities in the last two weeks were a necessary component of an effort to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=479.32s)]
*  degrade and or destroy or set back whatever term you want to use, the nuclear program. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=486.04s)]
*  It was a necessary component, but it wasn't sufficient. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=492.5s)]
*  That is to say the logic chain of the policy at some point would have had to involve an [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=498.74s)]
*  American dimension to take care of the infrastructure at Fordow and perhaps other places. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=506.16s)]
*  That was too difficult for Israel to reach. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=514.72s)]
*  Do you agree with that notion that the Israeli campaign was necessary but not sufficient [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=519.12s)]
*  and the U.S. would have had to step in to complete or at least add to what you had done? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=524.76s)]
*  No. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=532.48s)]
*  I think it is always better when the U.S. is joining force with us. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=534.2s)]
*  But the idea was to create such a military success, maybe without Fordow, that will force [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=540.16s)]
*  and will set the conditions to reach a political goal with a much better agreement than the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=550.48s)]
*  Trump administration tried to achieve in the 60 days of the deadline that they gave to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=561.72s)]
*  the negotiations. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=568.44s)]
*  Nobody thought that all the elements of the Iranian nuclear program will be stopped. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=569.44s)]
*  But the idea was to degrade it to a level that will take Iran, roll back Iran, two or [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=579.84s)]
*  three years and at the same time will make it very clear to them that if they go forward [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=589.2s)]
*  somebody will come again, whether the Americans or the Israelis. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  I see. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=601.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=602.72s)]
*  Karim, to you. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=603.72s)]
*  Today we've heard apparently from the Supreme Leader. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=605.96s)]
*  Just flat out, who do you think is making the decisions on an incredibly complicated [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=610.96s)]
*  enterprise for an 86 year old leader, most of whose trusted advisors or many of whom [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=617.04s)]
*  have been eliminated by the Israelis in their military strikes? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=622.76s)]
*  I think it still appears that the Supreme Leader is steering the ship. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=627.44s)]
*  It wasn't quite clear until this morning when he gave that speech. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=631.96s)]
*  And what was evident from that speech is a reflection of what we've seen from him over [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=636.04s)]
*  his four decade reign from 1989 to the present, which is he believes that his ideology is [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=644.72s)]
*  critical to his survival and the survival of the regime. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=652.76s)]
*  Whereas I think most Iranians would argue that their ideology imperils the survival [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=657.12s)]
*  of the regime. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  And the reason why I think this is important is that Khamenei is obsessed with the collapse [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  of the Soviet Union. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=670.84s)]
*  He believed that happened because Gorbachev tried to reform the Soviet Union. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=672.12s)]
*  And so we call men like Khamenei hardliners, they call themselves principalists. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  And what that means is that they are loyal to the principles of the revolution. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=681.1600000000001s)]
*  In my view, you can distill those down to three things now. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=684.48s)]
*  Death to America, death to Israel and a hijab. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=688.6800000000001s)]
*  And what I believe we've seen over the last three years is that one of those principles, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=691.9200000000001s)]
*  the mandatory hijab, they killed a woman in custody, Massa Amini, that triggered a year [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=696.52s)]
*  long protest which imperiled the regime's survival. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=702.84s)]
*  Now, this hostility, in my view, gratuitous hostility toward America and Israel have led [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=705.48s)]
*  to this ruinous war. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=712.0s)]
*  And so now you paint a portrait of where Khamenei is now in his life. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  As you said, 86 should be playing with his great grandchildren. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=720.76s)]
*  Instead, he's leading this three front war against the greatest superpower in the world, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=724.4399999999999s)]
*  greatest military power in the Middle East and his own people. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=728.68s)]
*  He's ruling what I call a Swiss cheese regime. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a regime which has been thoroughly penetrated by Israeli intelligence. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=734.28s)]
*  He doesn't control his own airspace. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  His regional proxies have been decimated. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=740.24s)]
*  A nuclear program which he spent upwards of perhaps $500 billion on when you consider [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=743.1999999999999s)]
*  some costs and then opportunity costs, sanctions and penalties has been significantly damaged. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=748.68s)]
*  And yet, despite all of that, as we saw today, his speech was as if nothing happened. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=755.2s)]
*  He declared victory. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=762.4s)]
*  He congratulated the Iranian people for that. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=763.64s)]
*  And to go back, and I'll conclude here to your original question to Amos, was this a [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=766.96s)]
*  war of choice or war of necessity? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=772.8000000000001s)]
*  In my view, Iran's antipathy toward Israel has been a war of choice. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=775.28s)]
*  It didn't have to be like this. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=781.6s)]
*  In my view, the two countries are more natural partners than they are adversaries. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=782.8s)]
*  Israel is a tech power. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  Iran is an energy power. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=787.24s)]
*  They could have a good compatible relationship as they did before the revolution. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=788.5999999999999s)]
*  So it's been a war of choice for Iran. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=792.3599999999999s)]
*  But I do think this was a battle of choice for Israel. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=796.28s)]
*  When they chose this battle was a choice. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=800.24s)]
*  And this battle has perhaps been concluded for now, but the war, unfortunately, will [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=805.1999999999999s)]
*  certainly persist so long as this supreme leader is in power. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=811.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=814.28s)]
*  You know, let me follow up on one point, Kareem. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=815.28s)]
*  You've come up with really very critically important insights in shaping my view of this [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  problem. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=825.24s)]
*  And you've argued that even the most extreme revolutionaries, the day after the revolution, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=826.24s)]
*  essentially becomes a conservative. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  And the conservation is to preserve the revolution, which sometimes requires tactical compromises [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=834.0s)]
*  or retreats. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=841.94s)]
*  Looking at one year how Iran has responded to Israel over the last two weeks and how [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=844.2s)]
*  they responded to the administration strike, June 22nd, 23rd, is that still the driving [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=847.84s)]
*  element? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=859.4s)]
*  I mean, redeem Iran's honor, but above all, preserve the structure of the regime. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=861.4s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=868.4s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, this is a regime which I've described to you before. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=869.4s)]
*  It's homicidal, but not suicidal. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=873.88s)]
*  It wants to stay in power. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=875.48s)]
*  And that's Hannah Arendt quotes who said that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=876.88s)]
*  And so I think the tension inside the inner circle now of the supreme leader's office [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=879.76s)]
*  and the senior rev guard commanders is this tension between the regime's survival instincts [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=887.7s)]
*  and defiant instincts. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=893.86s)]
*  Because remember, Khomeini has long believed both internally in the internal Iranian context [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=895.5400000000001s)]
*  and the foreign policy context that when you're being threatened by an adversary or when your [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=901.88s)]
*  population is rising up, never take a step back. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=907.5s)]
*  That's not going to alleviate the pressure against you. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=911.5s)]
*  That's going to embolden the adversary to take a step forward. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=914.36s)]
*  But he's now in this situation in which had he tried to throw back too hard a punch, I've [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  said this to you before, and that the parameters under which he was operating is if he responds [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=924.84s)]
*  weakly, he loses face. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=930.36s)]
*  If he responds too strongly, he could lose his head. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  In my view, that choreographed lob of missiles against the US base in Qatar was certainly [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=935.64s)]
*  not a show of strength. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=944.56s)]
*  And we will see in the coming weeks and months how this plays out. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=947.1s)]
*  If I could just add one final point there. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=952.48s)]
*  It's been commonly said over the last week or two that there's been a rally around the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=956.08s)]
*  flag effect for this regime. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=961.04s)]
*  I think it's a short-term sugar high. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=964.52s)]
*  Of course, populations don't like living under bombardment. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=968.04s)]
*  In contrast, Israeli society, which had been used to missile wars over the last decades, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=974.36s)]
*  this generation of Iranians haven't experienced this. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=980.56s)]
*  Iran was fighting Israel from Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni terrain, and those populations [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=983.1999999999999s)]
*  were bearing the brunt, not the people of Iran. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=988.8s)]
*  So certainly, the regime is trying to harness a nationalist fervor, but it's my view that [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=991.88s)]
*  three, six, nine months from now, that people's daily problems will persist. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=998.32s)]
*  And the data point I'd bring up here is the assassination of Qasem Soleimani. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1005.68s)]
*  In January 2020, we saw large crowds in Tehran. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1011.76s)]
*  Many commentators and TV programs were saying the population is united by the regime. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1016.22s)]
*  Two years later, Massa Amini was killed, set off nationwide protests. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1022.5s)]
*  So I think this is a regime which is both internally and externally at a dead end. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1026.26s)]
*  Amos, back to you. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1031.8600000000001s)]
*  Israel has struck in the US. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1034.7s)]
*  Kareem has outlined the nature of the Iranian response. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1037.3s)]
*  Let me ask you about the damage done. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1040.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Washington right now, I haven't seen it disroyaled over an intelligence assessment [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1042.98s)]
*  for quite some time. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1049.7s)]
*  We probably have to go back to Bush 43 and the Second Iraq War. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1050.7s)]
*  I mean, I started my career as an intelligence analyst. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1055.9s)]
*  I take intelligence seriously. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1058.38s)]
*  I take the politicalization of intelligence as a travesty because effective US policy, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1061.14s)]
*  has to be based on the world the way it is, not just the way you want the world to be. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1068.34s)]
*  So let me ask you, you had an article up in N12, an Israeli outlet, which I think is the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1074.78s)]
*  absolute best analysis of trying to parse through. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1080.1399999999999s)]
*  Give us your interpretation if you could. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1085.6999999999998s)]
*  I know it's early days, as the Brits would say, but give us your interpretation of exactly [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1088.06s)]
*  what you think Israel and Iran and the US have accomplished on the, not so much the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1094.04s)]
*  ballistic missile. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1102.3999999999999s)]
*  That's important, critically important, but on the issue of nuclear capacity. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1103.8799999999999s)]
*  Let me first do two remarks on intelligence. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1111.0s)]
*  First, intelligence has two roles. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1115.94s)]
*  One to tell the leaders on the state of the war what the intentions were, the capabilities [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1120.3400000000001s)]
*  of your enemy and what is happening. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1127.5400000000002s)]
*  And second, to make sure that you have the right target to decide the war. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1131.8600000000001s)]
*  What we saw in this war is an amazing level of intelligence. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1141.24s)]
*  To decapitate the leadership of the IRGC, especially those who are responsible for the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1146.6000000000001s)]
*  air and missile force and all the scientists that deal with weaponization. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1155.92s)]
*  All this happening in 10 minutes in 15 different places in Tehran. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1165.88s)]
*  It's amazing kind of intelligence. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1176.3400000000001s)]
*  And so are the destruction of the air defense of Iran, close to 100 ground-to-air batteries. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1179.3200000000002s)]
*  And so destruction of many ballistic missile launchers in Iran. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1192.58s)]
*  So this is intelligence for winning a war. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1200.1s)]
*  And the capability to connect firepower to this intelligence, I think is unique in the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1205.6399999999999s)]
*  war. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1212.54s)]
*  About intelligence. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1215.88s)]
*  We saw assessment during the last 20 years about the Iranian reaction to any attack on [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1219.44s)]
*  its nuclear sites. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1228.54s)]
*  There will be World War III, there will be regional war. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1230.98s)]
*  All the American bases in the Gulf, in Qatar, in Bahrain, in UAE will be attacked. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1235.26s)]
*  They will close the strait of Hormuz. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1244.5s)]
*  A wave of terrorism all over the place. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1246.84s)]
*  So all these alarmists that basically paralyze the American military should look back to [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1250.92s)]
*  their assessment. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1262.08s)]
*  And now to your question. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1264.7s)]
*  The political discussion in the US about Fordow has to do with political positions. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1268.3999999999999s)]
*  Those who oppose the war, oppose the president, are saying that they haven't achieved a lot. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1279.3999999999999s)]
*  And the president, of course, and the secretary of defense are saying that it's a wonderful [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1287.04s)]
*  attack. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1293.24s)]
*  But with all due respect to Fordow, the nuclear program of Iran consists of about 20 sites, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1295.9199999999998s)]
*  which Fordow is one of them. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1308.1999999999998s)]
*  The policy, the insurance policy, because it was under immunity in a way. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1310.4799999999998s)]
*  But there are other places, not less important. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1319.9199999999998s)]
*  Natas is one of them, Isfahan is one of them. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1324.4s)]
*  Scientists, organizations, archives, all kinds of places that create a nuclear project towards [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1328.4s)]
*  the border. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1340.04s)]
*  And most of it was destroyed. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1342.32s)]
*  Most of it. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1345.76s)]
*  We don't know exactly what happened in Fordow, because the whole idea is that there is a [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1347.4199999999998s)]
*  penetration bomb that goes into a mountain. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1353.6599999999999s)]
*  When in the mountains there are tunnels and centrifuges and in rich uranium. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1357.82s)]
*  Whether it's collapsed or not, nobody got there yet. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1363.6999999999998s)]
*  The satellites are showing six very good hitting. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1368.02s)]
*  I know the place. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1377.18s)]
*  It's the ventilation tubes of Fordow. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1379.34s)]
*  And I hope it done the work, but we don't know and we will not know because BDA is another [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1384.7s)]
*  intelligence force. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1394.26s)]
*  You fuse satellite photos with human, with SIGIN, with cyber, with all the intelligence [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1396.38s)]
*  sensors. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1409.98s)]
*  And sooner or later we'll know what happened to Fordow. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1412.5s)]
*  But whether we move them a year backward, two years backward, my personal assessment, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1416.1000000000001s)]
*  or three years backward, it's not that important. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1423.86s)]
*  What is important is the future. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1427.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1430.6599999999999s)]
*  Are we together, America, the US, create conditions for a much better deal? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1431.6599999999999s)]
*  Or if there is no deal, can we enforce the fact that they will not go forward? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1443.06s)]
*  Because if one last sentence on intelligence. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1451.46s)]
*  If I were the supreme leader, intelligence officer two years ago, I basically told him, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1455.9s)]
*  you see the Americans have the capability to destroy our nuclear program, but they don't [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1464.42s)]
*  have the will. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1469.78s)]
*  The Israelis have the will, they don't have the capability. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1471.14s)]
*  Now he knows that the Americans sometimes has the will and Israel has the capabilities. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1475.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1484.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1485.7s)]
*  So let's move forward. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1486.7s)]
*  Kareem, simple question. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1487.7s)]
*  Do you believe that what's happened over the last three weeks will harden the supreme leader [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1490.46s)]
*  and the IRGC position on the negotiations that the Trump administration maintained through [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1497.8799999999999s)]
*  five rounds? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1504.3s)]
*  Or will it create additional flexibility? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1506.3799999999999s)]
*  This is a separate question for the Americans as to what they intend to put on the table. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1511.34s)]
*  But do you think the Iranians are interested right now and capable of a negotiation that [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1516.78s)]
*  would lead to a more durable, not just cessation of hostilities, ceasefire cessation of hostilities [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1526.1599999999999s)]
*  and then an agreement? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1534.0600000000002s)]
*  Well let me repeat something I've shared with you before, which is over the last 46 years [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1536.5400000000002s)]
*  we can probably count on two fingers the number of times the Islamic Republic is compromised [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1540.74s)]
*  and the conditions are clear. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1545.0600000000002s)]
*  They feel existential economic pressure, credible military threat, they face a united diplomatic [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1546.8600000000001s)]
*  front, and they're provided what I would describe as kind of a face-saving diplomatic exit. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1552.1000000000001s)]
*  Those three conditions arguably exist right now in that there is certainly a credible [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1558.22s)]
*  military threat. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1562.42s)]
*  There's perhaps not yet existential economic angst, but that's a screw that the US can [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1564.22s)]
*  turn and they've been broadly isolated. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1569.3000000000002s)]
*  Their friends haven't really stuck up from them. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1573.1000000000001s)]
*  What is not clear to me, and so it's difficult for me to answer how the Iranian will respond [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1576.26s)]
*  if it's not clear what our end game is here in the United States, and it's not clear to [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1580.74s)]
*  me whether it's President Trump, it's clear what his end game is because when he publicly [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1587.02s)]
*  talks about this, he takes very different positions from unconditional surrender to [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1593.26s)]
*  regime change, make Iran great again. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1598.38s)]
*  And I think that the short answer is that their disposition will in some part depend [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1602.78s)]
*  on our disposition. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1609.98s)]
*  The concern I have is that the takeaway from not necessarily the leader, because I'm going [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1613.26s)]
*  to contradict myself in saying that I do think he's steering the ship, but I don't think [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1620.94s)]
*  the decision whether or not to go nuclear ultimately is going to be driven by him. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1627.26s)]
*  I think it's going to be the military and the Red Guard commanders. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1632.3s)]
*  Perhaps a lot of the Iranian society, their takeaway from this is that this revolutionary [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1639.38s)]
*  ideology and radicalism has led us to economic ruin and isolation. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1644.5s)]
*  It could well be that the takeaway from those senior Red Guard commanders is that our mistake [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1651.06s)]
*  wasn't having a nuclear program, our mistake wasn't more rapidly acquiring a nuclear weapon, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1656.5s)]
*  because almost knows this much better than I do. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1663.14s)]
*  If you look at the global landscape and countries that gave up or didn't have a nuclear weapon, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1665.74s)]
*  Ukraine, Libya, Saddam Hussein's Iraq made themselves vulnerable to external intervention, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1671.5s)]
*  North Korea and Pakistan have this cloak of immunity. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1676.78s)]
*  So that is a real danger that I worry about. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1679.9s)]
*  And I just conclude by saying that I think it's imperative that we have a clear understanding [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1682.6200000000001s)]
*  about what we're trying to achieve with the United States, because if we don't have that, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1688.3s)]
*  we obviously are not able to articulate to the Iranians what the goal is. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1693.74s)]
*  Right. I mean, most negotiations succeed when you have two parties who are willing and able. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1697.42s)]
*  And by the way, as Amos well knows, this is not just a bilateral negotiation. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1703.02s)]
*  There's a third party here, which is Israel. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1710.46s)]
*  Usually negotiations work when there's a balance of interests, when there's a measure of urgency, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1714.94s)]
*  whether there's some sort of deal or framework that both sides can agree on. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1720.62s)]
*  And the stumbling block has been the Iranians insist on the right to enrich on Iranian soil. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1725.9799999999998s)]
*  The administration's position has been zero enrichment. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1734.78s)]
*  And I don't want to speak for Amos, but I suspect Amos that after the last three weeks, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1737.58s)]
*  zero enrichment was likely to be the position of the government of Israel. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1743.6599999999999s)]
*  So if that's the case, what are the prospects for a serious negotiation [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1750.9399999999998s)]
*  that tries to reflect a balance of interest? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1759.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't think the Trump administration or the government of Israel is interested [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1762.3799999999999s)]
*  in a balance of interest. I think they're interested basically in capitalizing on the leverage. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1766.06s)]
*  I understand why Iran doesn't need a nuclear weapon and shouldn't have one. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1771.58s)]
*  It's a terrible regime, but we have what we have. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1775.8999999999999s)]
*  Back to you, Amos. If in the likely event, I hate making predictions, that you don't have [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1780.7s)]
*  a comprehensive agreement to deal with the Iranian nuclear issue, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1787.42s)]
*  you intimated what the alternative is going to be. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1795.58s)]
*  So what is the alternative, Amos? No agreement. What does the future look like? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1799.74s)]
*  I hope the regime changes. As Karim said, three, six, nine months, the people of Iran will understand [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1806.38s)]
*  that the victory speech of their leader today was a joke. It reminds me of Naim Qassem after Nasrallah. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1819.5800000000002s)]
*  This guy is weather-remoted from the world because he was in a bunker. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1831.82s)]
*  He refused to touch any communication and all the people that he used to trust and to work with [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1839.42s)]
*  for many, many years were not around. So whether he is disconnected from reality or [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1851.26s)]
*  as in authoritarian dictatorships, he tried to tell the people something that is different. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1861.18s)]
*  By the way, I'm not against an Iranian victory narrative. I'm not against it. If they think [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1872.3s)]
*  that they destroy Israel, fine. If it will help to make a reasonable deal because they won the war, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1879.74s)]
*  fine. But you asked me a different question. Whether there is no deal. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1889.74s)]
*  If regime change is not working and the regime is trying to rebuild the nuclear project, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1898.78s)]
*  I think Israel and the US have to put red lines and enforce the red lines. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  The red lines, very much like we are doing vis-a-vis Hezbollah in the north. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1917.5s)]
*  There is a UN Security Council resolution 1701. The Lebanese army should implement it that Hezbollah [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1925.26s)]
*  will not be south of the Litani River and will not smuggle weapons from Iran and will not produce [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1935.98s)]
*  weapons in Lebanon. If the Lebanese army is not doing the job, the IDF is doing the job [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1942.62s)]
*  and the US is supporting it. This is the Biden administration. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1948.9399999999998s)]
*  We strongly become partners to Netanyahu on making the possibility of Iran rebuilding the nuclear [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1953.8999999999999s)]
*  program not happening. It was his last sentence in the NATO summit because he moved himself [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1966.46s)]
*  from being 100% with Israel toward some kind of mediator when he enforced the ceasefire. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1980.46s)]
*  But after saying everything about the ceasefire and make Iran great again, he made it very clear [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=1992.38s)]
*  that the baseline is there is no nuclear program in Iran if it is not under the golden standard. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2001.26s)]
*  On the other side of the Persian Gulf, they are building now nuclear reactors in the UAE [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2012.46s)]
*  and they are using the golden standard. That's the 123 agreement of the Atomic Energy Act [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2019.1s)]
*  in the early 50s. No control of their own fuel cycle. It is the gold standard. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2028.94s)]
*  And I think even an international consortium on Iranian soil or maybe islands that they took from [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2035.8999999999999s)]
*  the UAE, international consortium that will make sure that the uranium is going to develop [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2046.86s)]
*  to produce energy for power and not nuclear war is a reasonable and acceptable deal. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2056.38s)]
*  Since both of you know that the Middle East more often than not produces gray outcomes [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2066.62s)]
*  rather than black or white outcomes. What do you think about this? We have lived since 2018, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2075.18s)]
*  since the Trump administration's withdrawal from the flawed but I would argue functional [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2083.98s)]
*  JCPOA. We have lived in a situation, yes Iran and Israel have struck one another twice each, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2091.4199999999996s)]
*  but we lived in a situation up until now where there was no peace and there was no, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2098.54s)]
*  as Amos pointed out, major regional war. Is it plausible to both of you that in the period ahead, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2104.8599999999997s)]
*  no deal, on one hand no regime change, on the other that what is likely perhaps to unfold [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2115.18s)]
*  is this no war? I think in fact I think Kareem, before you actually may have mentioned this notion [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2127.66s)]
*  that may be the preference for the regime right now. So first to you Kareem, is it plausible? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2136.7s)]
*  I think it is plausible scenario whereby there's no war and no deal and it's stasis but it will [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2145.4199999999996s)]
*  also depend on the coming weeks, the extent to which Iran is willing or unwilling to [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2154.14s)]
*  cooperate with the IAEA. I mean Amos can speak to this much better than I can but if it becomes [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2162.3799999999997s)]
*  a scenario whereby it appears that, and you know the Iranian parliament which is a rubber [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2167.5s)]
*  stamp parliament but the speaker of the parliament, Qalibov, is close to Khamenei, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2174.46s)]
*  so this is where these edicts come from. They announced that the regime will leave the NPT and [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2179.74s)]
*  cease cooperation. So if that's the path they decide to go down, that may be sustainable for [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2187.82s)]
*  six months to a year but I defer to Amos. My sense is that if it appears that they are trying to [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2195.5s)]
*  rapidly redouble their efforts in pursuit of a nuclear weapon, I don't think that [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2202.7s)]
*  is a stable situation. My sense is that more likely Israel rather than President Trump. I think [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2212.22s)]
*  President Trump wants to move on to the next thing but Israel may be forced to mow the lawn again as [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2217.98s)]
*  you say in Israeli parlance. Right, well I'm not ruling it out. When I say no peace, no war, I mean [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2223.66s)]
*  no transformative agreement on one hand and no major regional escalation on the other. That [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2228.62s)]
*  doesn't mean that the normal Iranian-Israeli relationship which is cyber, Iran's support for [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2234.38s)]
*  proxies, terrorism and even Israeli strikes might not continue off and on. Amos, what do you say [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2242.06s)]
*  about this? No agreement, no regime change. What does the next year or two look like? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2252.3s)]
*  I think we'll have to see where the Iranians are going. Are they leaving the NPT? Are they creating [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2261.7400000000002s)]
*  somewhere a secret nuclear program? Going with the goal to achieve a nuclear bomb? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2273.02s)]
*  Or they are investing in their traditional source of power which are two, the proxies on one hand [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2283.9s)]
*  and the ballistic missile on the other. So now they have to, since the proxies were destroyed, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2294.22s)]
*  the ballistic missiles half destroyed, the nuclear 80% destroyed and Iran is under sanctions [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2301.8199999999997s)]
*  and they have to decide what are the priorities. So as long as the priorities are those that are [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2311.5s)]
*  not a red line, we can go back to the previous behavior, the shadow war, the war under the table. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2320.7s)]
*  But I think the US is very important. If you pay attention to the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2332.2999999999997s)]
*  50 Israeli airplanes that flew to Iran after Iran violated the ceasefire with one ballistic missile [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2340.38s)]
*  and Trump called Bibi and make sure that they will not drop the boats. So the US position here, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2353.26s)]
*  whether they will go together with Israel on the new enforcement policy or as he said, Trump will [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2362.7799999999997s)]
*  move to the next issue and after celebrating his success he will not be interested anymore. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2373.02s)]
*  It's two different course of action or scenarios. In Israel they feel that they [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2380.54s)]
*  reach air superiority over Iran that will be kept for a long time until Iran will rebuild itself [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2390.54s)]
*  and at least the enforcement is not operationally so difficult in the coming year or two. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2401.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2411.3399999999997s)]
*  You're a wise man Amos. We started a few minutes late so I want to keep you both for a couple more [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2418.8599999999997s)]
*  minutes on the issue of regime change. You know thinking about the Middle East in the last 15-20 [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2424.94s)]
*  years longer you could basically argue that there were three models. Egypt, Tunisia in which large [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2431.8199999999997s)]
*  numbers of Egyptians and Tunisians took to the streets, security services either were unwilling [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2439.58s)]
*  or unable and the military in Egypt eased Mubarak out of power. That's one. Second is what happened [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2445.02s)]
*  in December. You have HTS, a former al Qaeda affiliate with governing experience in Idlib [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2451.66s)]
*  but a coherent force backed by the Turks surging into Damascus and in 10 days the [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2460.94s)]
*  outside regime was gone. Then the third is George W. Bush. You invade Iraq, you depose its [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2465.82s)]
*  fine, you find, try, execute Saddam Hussein. So do any of these seem [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2473.6600000000003s)]
*  relevant to the Iranian experience Karim? And one additional point. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2485.34s)]
*  We assume somehow or maybe the Israelis do, Amos I'm not sure you would assume that regime change [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2489.18s)]
*  is going to produce a government more aligned with U.S. Western Israeli [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2495.8199999999997s)]
*  style, character. That's not the only possibility. It may not be the most realistic possibility but [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2505.5s)]
*  Karim to you first on this. Yeah let me make a few brief points. One I first recommend to everyone a [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2510.86s)]
*  wonderful book by a scholar called Jack Goldstone. It's just a short history of revolutions. I've [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2515.9s)]
*  learned a lot from it and what Goldstone says in the book, it's a very interesting book. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2520.7000000000003s)]
*  It's a very interesting book. It's a very interesting book. It's a very interesting book. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2527.26s)]
*  What Goldstone says in the book, it's a wonderful metaphor which he says revolutions are like [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2532.14s)]
*  earthquakes. We know which countries are very seismic and they have a lot of fault lines. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2538.14s)]
*  We can never predict when an earthquake exactly is going to happen. Likewise you can't predict [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2544.2999999999997s)]
*  exactly when a revolution is going to happen. You know as I wrote in the essay earlier this [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2548.46s)]
*  week in the New York Times, we know from history from World War II to the present, only one in four [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2553.2599999999998s)]
*  authoritarian transitions end in democracy. More often they end in another form of authoritarianism. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2558.38s)]
*  So I'd say there's kind of a couple things to look for. Number one you mentioned Egypt and Tunisia. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2564.1400000000003s)]
*  What happened in those countries was that the military has decided to cut loose the autocrats [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2568.86s)]
*  to preserve their own interests. In Iran you have a revolutionary guard which up until now its [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2573.98s)]
*  interests is they've seen their interests intertwined with the supreme leader. That's a big [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2578.94s)]
*  question. At some point are they capable of cutting loose this leader? That's a big question. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2583.82s)]
*  The second point I'd make is that there's another option which you didn't mention Aaron which is [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2590.06s)]
*  commonly called the negotiated revolution. South Africa is one example. Poland whereby [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2597.34s)]
*  kind of elites within the system and with the opposition realize you know what this is just [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2603.42s)]
*  not going well. It's a disaster. It's been a disaster for all of us and in the Iranian context [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2610.14s)]
*  it may be the emergence of like a Deng Xiaoping figure. Someone who actually Deng Xiaoping was [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2616.14s)]
*  very much you know part of the cultural revolution and an acolyte of Mao but also someone who was [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2620.7s)]
*  ready he had the kind of revolutionary credentials to say you know what it's time to put national [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2625.98s)]
*  interest economic interests before revolutionary ideology. Finally I do think as I've said Iran [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2632.38s)]
*  in my view has a G20 society. It's a country which has enormous talent, human capital, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2641.02s)]
*  natural resources, should be G20 country. I think there is a popular demand for representative [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2646.46s)]
*  government, accountable government up until now though that the demand of the society has not been [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2653.02s)]
*  met with a leadership that would lead that kind of alternative to representative government in [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2659.82s)]
*  Iran. You know it could be that that leader emerges and this is one of the great observations of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2665.26s)]
*  Henry Kissinger that you know it's really the the leader that that shapes events in the world. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2669.5s)]
*  Amos we're running out of time. Unless you have a thought on regime change I want to ask you one [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2675.34s)]
*  final question about Gaza. Do you think that from a political point of view in Israel, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2681.42s)]
*  probably the Trump administration, that's probably going to push harder for an end to this war, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2691.26s)]
*  that what's happened in the last three weeks has increased the possibility of an end to the war, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2696.46s)]
*  the release of hostages living and dead and a better future for 2.3 million Palestinians who [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2704.94s)]
*  have suffered long enough over the course of the last year and a half? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2713.34s)]
*  Yeah I think we have a higher chance to do the right thing that I'm recommending [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2721.5s)]
*  since the defeat of Hezbollah almost a year ago, 10 months ago, to end the war in Gaza [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2729.7400000000002s)]
*  and the chances are higher because of President Trump. It seems to me that he wants to end the [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2740.86s)]
*  war and he now has a leverage vis-a-vis the prime minister because he helped him on Iran [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2749.18s)]
*  and today he tried to help him on his trial asking the Israelis to release Netanyahu from the trial [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2757.34s)]
*  and I think the pressure is happening as we speak and Netanyahu may why he haven't stopped the war [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2768.7s)]
*  in Gaza among other things because his government was politically under the danger of [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2779.7400000000002s)]
*  the two right wingers, Ben-Guram Smotrich leaving the government. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2787.5800000000004s)]
*  Netanyahu is contemplating about election, taking advantage of the big victory against Iran [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2792.38s)]
*  and Hezbollah and Syria and doing a deal will also help him with bringing back the hostages. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2801.5s)]
*  Yes the right wingers will leave his government but if he goes to election he doesn't care about. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2810.22s)]
*  So let's hope that my analysis is going to happen because we need to end the war in Gaza. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2820.62s)]
*  Israel defense doctrine is calling for short wars and if possible decisive outcomes. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2828.2200000000003s)]
*  This is exactly not Gaza and this war is making damage to Israel in the last six months. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2836.62s)]
*  It's time to finish it. Yeah that's going to require a better Middle East, a better future [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2847.1800000000003s)]
*  in this region is going to require something that's been sadly lacking [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2853.26s)]
*  which is leadership everywhere among Palestinians in Israel, in Iran, in the Gulf and of course [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2857.5s)]
*  in Washington. Amos Jadlin and Karim Sajibpour want to thank you once again you've exceeded my [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2869.6600000000003s)]
*  expectations in 45 to 50 minutes. Probably the best analysis of Iranian and Israeli objectives [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2877.18s)]
*  and costs and consequences of what we've seen over the last two to three weeks. So thank you [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2885.5s)]
*  so much for participating until the next time actually next Tuesday we'll gather again with [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2889.8999999999996s)]
*  Karim and General David Petraeus for another I think will be a terrific conversation. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2897.66s)]
*  Send me a note. Thank you all for sure. Thanks again Amos and Karim. Thank you to both. Good night. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPIejYhmQI&t=2907.18s)]
