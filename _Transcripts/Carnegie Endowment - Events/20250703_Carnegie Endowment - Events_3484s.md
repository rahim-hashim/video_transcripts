Video Description: The foreign aid system is in crisis. Official Development Assistance (ODA) is becoming increasingly unavailable, following the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, the country’s leading aid agency, and European states redirecting spending to their militaries. These cutbacks put more pressure on the already precarious flow of remittances, the transfer of funds or goods from migrants back to their communities of origin. These funds account for the largest distribution of funds from rich countries to poorer ones, which are also more vulnerable to climate impacts, and are thus a crucial component of climate finance.
The continued crackdown on migrants in the United States, with a growing number of immigrants being removed from the country and therefore unable to earn wages to send home, is expanding to target remittances with potential legislation taxing outbound transfers made by non-citizens. As the world grapples with more climate-related disasters, and decreases institutional funding to support recovery, remittances are increasingly important to global climate resilience.  
How should remittances fit into the climate finance puzzle? What’s the outlook for both ODA and remittance financial flows in 2025? And what steps can destination and origin countries take to increase remittance flows and utilize them for socially important investments?  
Join Noah Gordon, a fellow in the Sustainability, Climate, and Geopolitics Program, in conversation with Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, senior fellow and director of the Sustainability, Climate, and Geopolitics Program at the Carnegie Endowment; Lindsay Jenkins, Former Senior Advisor, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, U.S. Department of State; Sam Huckstep, research associate within the Center for Global Development’s Migration, Displacement and Humanitarian Policy Program; and Jon Kurtz, senior director for research and learning at Mercy Corps.

# Remittances and the Climate Finance Crisis
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to a Carnegie Endowment conversation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Noah Gordon. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm a fellow in the Sustainability, Climate and Geopolitics program here at the Carnegie [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Endowment and you've joined us today to talk about remittances and the climate finance [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=18.44s)]
*  crisis. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=22.56s)]
*  Remittances, the transfer funds or goods from migrants back to their communities of origin, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=23.56s)]
*  are actually the largest flows of money from rich countries to poor ones. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  They amounted to over $650 billion in 2023. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  That's more than foreign direct investment and foreign aid combined. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=35.08s)]
*  And in a time when rich countries are slashing their foreign aid budgets and struggling especially [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=37.48s)]
*  to increase climate finance as the world continues to overheat, these financial flows become [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=41.8s)]
*  even more important. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=45.72s)]
*  And so we came together today to talk about how remittances fit into the climate finance [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=46.72s)]
*  puzzle and explore steps that policymakers could take to increase remittance flows and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=50.76s)]
*  maybe direct them to socially important investments like climate adaptation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=55.48s)]
*  So we've got a great panel for you today who I'll introduce now, starting with Leonardo [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=59.44s)]
*  Martinez-Diaz, my colleague, the director of the Sustainability, Climate and Geopolitics [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  program. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=67.0s)]
*  Welcome, Leo. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=68.0s)]
*  Lindsay Jenkins, former senior advisor in the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=69.8s)]
*  at the U.S. State Department. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=73.56s)]
*  Hi Lindsay. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=75.12s)]
*  Then Sam Huckstep, a research associate for the Migration, Displacement and Humanitarian [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=76.8s)]
*  Policy program at the Center for Global Development. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Sam, welcome. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=83.0s)]
*  And finally, John Kurtz, senior director for research and learning at Mercy Corps. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=84.8s)]
*  So we five are going to speak for about 45 minutes before we bring in you, the audience. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  You can use a YouTube chat to ask us questions. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  And I want to start a bit with the context, the foreign aid crisis that is making remittances [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=96.64s)]
*  so important. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=100.52s)]
*  Sam, maybe going to you, what's driving the cuts in foreign aid? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=101.52s)]
*  Which countries are cutting the most aid and who might be hit hardest by these cuts? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=104.6s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=108.92s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=109.92s)]
*  What's driving the cuts in foreign aid? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  I think we're seeing an increased rise in nationalism, which is making people less interested [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=112.92s)]
*  in contributing foreign aid. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=118.34s)]
*  And we've also seen the knock-on effects of that nationalism. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=120.12s)]
*  We're seeing in the U.S. decreased interest in supporting people beyond the country's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  own borders, as JD Vance has indicated. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=128.32s)]
*  And we're also seeing an increased interest in tariffs and also in demanding increased [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=131.56s)]
*  military expenditure elsewhere. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=137.68s)]
*  These are having knock-on effects for countries, for other DAC donors, especially OECD DAC [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=139.82s)]
*  donors. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=144.33999999999997s)]
*  So we're seeing very large amounts of aid being cut across the board. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. is by far the biggest cutter, but we're also seeing cuts from other countries. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=149.66s)]
*  It's estimated, although this is slightly uncertain because of tremendous opacity in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  U.S. announcements, that the U.S. will cut something in the region of 56% of its official [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=159.2s)]
*  development assistance between 2023 and 2026. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=164.98s)]
*  But we're also seeing major cuts from the U.K., Germany and in all probability, France. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=168.22s)]
*  Some countries are increasing development assistance, Korea and Italy notably. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=173.1s)]
*  And in terms of the countries that are being affected the most, it's a little hard to say [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=177.14s)]
*  at this stage because we don't know exactly how countries will choose to make their allocation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=181.26s)]
*  decisions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=186.5s)]
*  But the basic takeaway has got to be that if a country, if an aid receiving country was [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=187.78s)]
*  previously reliant on the U.S., they will be hit hard. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=192.14s)]
*  So our projections at the center of global development are that Lesotho, for example, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=195.78s)]
*  will lose something in the region of 52% of its official development assistance due to its [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  dependence on the U.S. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=205.1s)]
*  But, yes, generally speaking, if a country was reliant on the U.S., the U.K., Germany, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=207.06s)]
*  then they will be significantly affected. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=213.74s)]
*  In the OECD, the OECD also says international aid from official donors fell in 2024 for the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=216.62s)]
*  first time in five years. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=221.22s)]
*  And that was before the U.S. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=222.26s)]
*  dismantled USAID. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=223.62s)]
*  And part of that was the cuts that some European countries are making to pay for increased [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=225.42s)]
*  defense spending. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=228.98s)]
*  John, I want to go to you because Mercy Corps runs some life saving foreign aid programs, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=230.02s)]
*  food banks in Nigeria, Gaza, et cetera. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=233.98s)]
*  So your organization has been affected by the cuts. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=236.66s)]
*  What's it like out there for an organization like Mercy Corps? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=238.46s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=241.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we are not alone as an operational organization trying to continue to use what [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=244.14s)]
*  resources we have on both the humanitarian side where, you know, I will say that there's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  been less cut there to date for some of the most extreme crises, places like Sudan and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=256.34s)]
*  elsewhere. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=261.7s)]
*  But especially on the development and the climate side, you know, we're seeing the sort [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=263.38s)]
*  of the longer term, more preventative investments as the ones that are particularly being cut [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=267.58s)]
*  by the U.S. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  So that's an area that we're working to try to fill gaps ourselves, potentially pull [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  in other funders and amassing what we can to be able to do as much as we can with that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  So tough times, but definitely a forcing function on looking at what's most effective, what's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  most cost effective. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  There's actually a shocking study in The Lancet from a few days ago just showing how important [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  USAID was. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=299.26000000000005s)]
*  I think it was the results with this USAID over the last two decades prevented 91 million [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=300.26000000000005s)]
*  deaths globally. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  And the research has also found that the cuts could result in 14 million additional deaths [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=307.06s)]
*  by 2030. So the stakes are quite high for some of those programs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=310.9s)]
*  Maybe, you know, as we move towards remittances, let's zoom in on the climate angle here and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  come to Leo. Leo, you led the climate finance team in the office of the Special Presidential [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=319.62s)]
*  Envoy for Climate and State. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  We talked also not just about the foreign aid crisis, but about the climate finance [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=324.94s)]
*  crisis. How would you assess climate finance in 2025 and, you know, progress towards the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=328.26s)]
*  new goal the country set at the most recent COP? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=332.9s)]
*  Well, on one hand, there was recognition at the last COP that the needs for climate finance [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=335.82s)]
*  have never been higher and larger. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=341.02s)]
*  After a very extensive process of needs assessment, it was clear that developing countries [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  are going to require well over a trillion dollars a year to help meet some of those [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  climate action needs. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=354.34s)]
*  And at the same time, we're facing very severe cuts in climate finance as well as development [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=356.26s)]
*  finance. This is not surprising. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=361.86s)]
*  Ultimately, climate finance, development finance and humanitarian assistance in many [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=363.5s)]
*  countries comes from the same pot of money. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=368.58s)]
*  It's the same budgetary, notional budgetary allocation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=370.53999999999996s)]
*  And so if you cut one, you're likely going to cut across many of them. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=374.86s)]
*  All of three of those categories are now under pressure as there is both anemic economic [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=378.42s)]
*  growth and the pressure to increase military and security spending in Europe and other [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=383.7s)]
*  key donor countries. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=389.82s)]
*  At the last COP, of course, the participants in those negotiations [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=392.18s)]
*  concluded with an important outcome, which is that now we need 300 billion dollars per [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=398.46s)]
*  year in climate finance for developing countries by 2035. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=404.38s)]
*  That is a tripling. It's actually less than a tripling if you consider inflation of the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=409.18s)]
*  100 billion dollar per year commitment that was finally reached in 2022. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=414.06s)]
*  But now we're going to be hard pressed to reach to stay at 100 billion and even more [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=419.46s)]
*  hard pressed to reach 300 billion. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=425.46s)]
*  And of course, many developing countries still want a road map, as we will see in the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=427.9s)]
*  LEM at the next COP in December in Brazil, a road map on how do you get to one point [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=432.29999999999995s)]
*  three trillion a year. Right. So there's a huge gap here between expectations, between [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=437.85999999999996s)]
*  hopes, between needs on one hand and between what's actually being discussed in capitals [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=442.38s)]
*  in many of the key donor countries. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=448.02s)]
*  And so a key question for everyone here is going to be, how do we start to think more [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  strategically across the pillars, humanitarian development and climate? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=455.62s)]
*  How do we, as John mentioned, make the most of the money that's there? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=459.94s)]
*  How do we find the needs that are most pressing? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  And to anticipate your point on remittances, how do we help to deal with these flows that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  are countercyclical? How do you get money into countries when things are bad, when [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=470.41999999999996s)]
*  there's a shock, a crisis? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=474.3s)]
*  And how do we make sure those key cushions of stabilizing finance continue? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=476.38s)]
*  You mentioned you mentioned countercyclical and that's where remittances can maybe come [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=482.62s)]
*  in just on climate finance or development finance. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=486.38s)]
*  I know how poignant it is at the Big UN Conference on Development currently taking place in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=488.34s)]
*  Sevilla is happening at a time when it's 42 degrees Celsius. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=492.38s)]
*  That's one hundred and eight Fahrenheit. I mean, the attendees must be baking and it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=495.74s)]
*  kind of shows the urgency of the challenge here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=499.18s)]
*  All right, let's get to remittances and the climate finance connection and bring you in, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=501.82s)]
*  Lindsay. Lindsay, you have a new paper out on innovative approaches to climate finance. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=504.7s)]
*  And one of your proposals was for diaspora finance. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=508.34s)]
*  Can you tell us what that is, how it fits with remittances and how it could maybe support [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=510.94s)]
*  climate action? Sure. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=514.1s)]
*  Thanks so much, Noah. And thank you again for pulling this together as we've all made [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=516.34s)]
*  the point. It couldn't be at a more critical time. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=520.62s)]
*  So in generally speaking, I think because of all the reasons that have been highlighted, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=522.9399999999999s)]
*  we really need to think about how we can motivate as many actors to the table and what [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=528.42s)]
*  role can a limited amount of public funding do to incentivize and catalyze actors [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=535.26s)]
*  into the climate finance space to really focus a lot on building up adaption and and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=542.22s)]
*  resilience capacity. And so for all the reasons discussed earlier, the diaspora is a [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=550.38s)]
*  key stakeholder and partner in this space. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=558.66s)]
*  And we're really looking here as I'm talking about remittances or what I'm talking about [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=562.14s)]
*  to diaspora finance, you're looking at everything from individual remittances to pooled [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=567.1s)]
*  remittances to even more formal investments in in home countries, economies and types of [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=572.26s)]
*  industries that are advancing towards green economy and other things that can really [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=582.3s)]
*  drive innovation. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=587.7s)]
*  And here we're looking at how can a range of actors, whether that's governments, home [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=589.38s)]
*  governments or destination country governments, but then also philanthropy and others, how [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=597.62s)]
*  can we catalyze and create good investments in our good climates and good programming to [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=607.5400000000001s)]
*  incentivize investments in at a very local level or at a national level, even in home [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=614.42s)]
*  countries of that funding, that investment that goes from the diaspora. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=621.14s)]
*  And here there are some good programs that that we can look to. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=625.86s)]
*  And actually, I'm even thinking, as we're looking at the at the financing for development [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=629.62s)]
*  conference this week, you had a really interesting announcement that came out from the EU and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=638.42s)]
*  EFAD of a new program that they are going to be undertaking called Resilient Remit, where [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=644.5799999999999s)]
*  they're going to be putting forth a relatively modest amount as far as the numbers go of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=650.9s)]
*  about four and a quarter million euros. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  But to incentivize, you know, to create programs in Honduras, in Senegal, in the United States, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=659.3s)]
*  and in Pakistan to incentivize diaspora investments in adaptation and resilience related [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=668.66s)]
*  projects. They are going to be focusing on a range of some of the various barriers that exist [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=679.86s)]
*  to to impact from remittances. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=686.8199999999999s)]
*  It's everything from, you know, kind of lowering some of the fees, but also, you know, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=690.5799999999999s)]
*  incentivizing access to savings and credit and insurance and other financial services. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=695.14s)]
*  And this way, you're really taking the power of the diaspora, whether on an individual [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=700.8199999999999s)]
*  level or on a more group pooled level, to really target it towards investments in their home [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=706.34s)]
*  communities that will build up that adaptation and resilience response that is very necessary [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=716.42s)]
*  to help people stay safe and find stability. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=722.82s)]
*  Interesting. I hadn't seen the new you announcement, which is quite encouraging. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=728.1s)]
*  And John, I saw you nodding along when Lindsay was talking about pool remittances. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=732.82s)]
*  You've done some work on that as well. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=736.5s)]
*  You've written about maximizing the potential of remittances as financial support for communities [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=737.62s)]
*  affected by climate. Anything you want to add there? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=742.1s)]
*  I'm keen to learn more on the pooled side. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=745.86s)]
*  And I've read from some of you all's work, some interesting pilots out there [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=748.2600000000001s)]
*  to try to do that and to get country governments to match. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=752.5s)]
*  One thing we've been doing, though, is trying to leverage remittances, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=756.82s)]
*  especially for what we're calling anticipatory action. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=760.5s)]
*  So that's the idea of getting assistance ahead of predicted climate disasters. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=762.9s)]
*  And there's been some good evidence generally in the field on this being able to save lives [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=770.02s)]
*  and livelihoods and, you know, in the face of floods, et cetera. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=774.26s)]
*  But the public financing that is generally being used for anticipatory action has a lot of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=777.8599999999999s)]
*  limitations, including it's sort of slow and less responsive. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=784.66s)]
*  So we've been exploring how remittances might be able to be leveraged [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=788.8199999999999s)]
*  in that anticipatory action space. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=793.06s)]
*  And in particular, you know, working with, in this case, remittly, a large remittance provider [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=794.9s)]
*  to try not to just to go beyond what they and other large remittance providers often do, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=801.78s)]
*  which is to have fee waivers after a major climate disaster. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=806.42s)]
*  That's really fairly standard practice and definitely helpful. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=810.0999999999999s)]
*  But trying to get more remittances to affected households or potentially affected communities [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=812.42s)]
*  ahead of a disaster to reap some of those benefits of sort of preparedness or early response. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=819.14s)]
*  And so this is one where we're currently piloting it in Latin America, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=825.38s)]
*  looking specifically at hurricanes. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=829.78s)]
*  And so far, and still in the testing stage to basically have remittly send out messages [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=831.46s)]
*  and a financial sort of discount to senders who would regularly remit to Latin America [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=841.3000000000001s)]
*  in anticipation of a hurricane this coming season. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=847.7s)]
*  So we're really looking there to test whether people do send more. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=851.94s)]
*  Does it get to potentially affected households faster? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=855.0600000000001s)]
*  And then how do they use that money to get out of harm's way or to recover more quickly? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=859.14s)]
*  And there we see lots of potential for remittances as just a bigger pool of financing for those [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=863.7s)]
*  kinds of responses. But also, again, much more nimble and potentially scalable [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=868.9s)]
*  for different climate shocks, different reasons. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=875.46s)]
*  Really interesting. So not just, you know, recovery, but proactive adaptation. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=878.26s)]
*  Sam, one thing I like about your work is all the data work you do. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=883.62s)]
*  So I'm going to come to you for some more facts on which countries rely the most on remittances. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=886.1s)]
*  Thanks. And I really enjoyed hearing about John's work. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=891.22s)]
*  I'm a big fan of Mercy Corps work with remit. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=893.94s)]
*  Leon, I'd love to see more pilots trying to do that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=895.78s)]
*  So the states that are most reliant on remittances are generally speaking, smaller states. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=899.38s)]
*  They're states that have fewer domestic employment opportunities. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=905.7s)]
*  And these are often small island developing states. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=909.0600000000001s)]
*  There's a few exceptions that rule Tajikistan sends a lot of migrants [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=911.46s)]
*  often to Russia and Eastern Europe. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=915.94s)]
*  And they receive remittances or estimated to have received remittances [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=918.1800000000001s)]
*  equal to something in the region of 45 percent of their GDP in 2024, which is pretty staggering. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=922.34s)]
*  But it's a small island developing states where from a climate finance perspective, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=927.62s)]
*  they are most interesting in a way you're probably going to be seeing remittances used [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=931.7800000000001s)]
*  most frequently for purposes that could be considered adaptation. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=935.3000000000001s)]
*  So Tonga is really the standout among them. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=939.46s)]
*  It's estimated to have received remittances equal to about 38 percent of GDP in 2024. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=943.14s)]
*  And then Nicaragua and Lebanon, again, small countries that have small labor markets, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=949.9399999999999s)]
*  received 27 percent and Samoa 26 percent. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=955.38s)]
*  These are also all countries which are affected in different ways by climate shocks. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=958.58s)]
*  And so, of course, remittances are going to play a major role in all of those areas. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=964.18s)]
*  Got it. Yeah, there's a real overlap between the climate vulnerable states [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=968.98s)]
*  and those most reliant on remittances. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=972.26s)]
*  To the audience, we've had more people join. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=973.9399999999999s)]
*  Please put your questions in at any time. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=975.3s)]
*  We'll collect them for the last part of the discussion. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=976.74s)]
*  I mean, Sam, I'll hit you with some more data myself, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=978.8199999999999s)]
*  because I've sort of been tracking remittance flows since Trump took office for the second time. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=981.22s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=985.14s)]
*  Initially, after Trump took office, remittances from the US to Central America surged. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=985.7s)]
*  People suspected that people were trying to get money home [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=990.02s)]
*  before they possibly had to leave or face deportation. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=992.5s)]
*  The US has revoked the protected status of many migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=995.38s)]
*  Nicaragua, etc. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1000.82s)]
*  But the latest data, certainly on remittances to Mexico, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1002.0200000000001s)]
*  has them down about 12 percent compared to the same period last year. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1004.4200000000001s)]
*  And people are suspecting that some workers may be scared to go to the work site for fear [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1008.2600000000001s)]
*  that they could come across the authorities and have to leave the country. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1013.86s)]
*  So we're seeing different effects on remittance flows. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1017.62s)]
*  And there's a new tax on remittances that I want to come back to with you later, Sam. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1020.0200000000001s)]
*  But, Lindsay, maybe going back to you, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1024.26s)]
*  your work at State, you talked about DASPR finance. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1027.46s)]
*  How did it fit in when you were working for the US government? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1029.6999999999998s)]
*  How did that fit into your work as an advisor on migration policy? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1032.02s)]
*  Sure. I think the situation that we're seeing now, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1036.1799999999998s)]
*  whereby the global gap between need and availability of public funding for development [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1039.6999999999998s)]
*  and humanitarian assistance, this is not a new situation that we're facing. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1050.8999999999999s)]
*  But of course, it's grown only more acute in recent months. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1055.54s)]
*  But a lot of the thinking that we had been doing was, how can we, given the scope and scale, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1058.9s)]
*  engage as many partners as possible as part of the solution? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1066.74s)]
*  Now, whether that was on ideas, expertise, experience, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1070.8200000000002s)]
*  or resources to put towards the solution. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1074.42s)]
*  And so in many ways, we had a very partnership-centered approach [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1076.98s)]
*  to any of the global challenges that we faced, but particularly on the global [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1083.8600000000001s)]
*  migration and refugee response challenges of our day, including the ways in which climate impacts [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1088.98s)]
*  on human mobility. Really thinking about how can you focus your resources, a limited pool of [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1099.0600000000002s)]
*  resources, towards catalyzing others into the space and coming up with good events. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1106.3400000000001s)]
*  So I think in many ways, we looked at traditional partners, governments, MDBs, private sector, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1111.62s)]
*  or all of these things, but then looking towards, of course, partnering with the diaspora. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1121.9399999999998s)]
*  And the diaspora is not a monolith. I think we all know that well. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1127.1399999999999s)]
*  But there are certain things that the diaspora brings to the table [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1132.1799999999998s)]
*  consistently. And that is very much a sense of innovation, a very strong commitment to [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1136.5s)]
*  their homes and their communities, and also in many ways, really their new communities and [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1147.2199999999998s)]
*  looking forward to creating a better future. So in many ways, our partnerships and engagement [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1153.9399999999998s)]
*  with the diaspora was really focused on that and thinking about ways that not only leveraging in [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1160.8200000000002s)]
*  multilateral diplomacy spaces, but really starting to think about what are the ways that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1166.66s)]
*  if the diaspora is already investing in climate action and in other areas, what were ways that we [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1172.1000000000001s)]
*  as a US government could be supporting that and incentivizing that and starting to think about [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1181.54s)]
*  that. And so it wasn't just a state PRM, it was USAID who did not only fund direct assistance, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1187.22s)]
*  grants and other things, but really had that forward leaning approach, thinking about ways [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1196.34s)]
*  to take more innovative, not just grant space, but really how their investments could catalyze [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1202.66s)]
*  more actors into a very needed space. How much to impact there? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1211.06s)]
*  You close by talking about grants, and this comes up in the debate about should we count [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1217.0600000000002s)]
*  remittances as climate finance? Could they be considered private climate finance funds [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1221.3000000000002s)]
*  mobilized by public funds? They don't have to be paid back, that's one advantage, but there are [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1227.8600000000001s)]
*  also some drawbacks to relying on remittances. I don't know if Sam or Leo, you have thoughts [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1231.7s)]
*  here on the debate. Can you consider remittances as climate finance? Leo, a lot of the US approach [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1235.3000000000002s)]
*  was about mobilizing private funds. So either Leo and Sam on this question of how to consider [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1239.54s)]
*  these massive financial flows? Look, I think as a firm or climate negotiator, I think a lot of [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1244.74s)]
*  countries would object to that, because these are ultimately private flows within families that are [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1251.14s)]
*  trying to support some of their friends and family back home. The uses, the time of the sending of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1257.38s)]
*  the money, the amounts, that's all ultimately a private decision, and therefore obviously cannot [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1264.5s)]
*  be considered to be public, and the uses may or may not be what one would consider climate finance [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1271.94s)]
*  under the various definitions. And importantly, these are not official from the point of view of [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1278.3400000000001s)]
*  the Paris Agreement and so on. This is not an official act that is trying to support the [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1283.54s)]
*  Global South with Global North financing, right? And so I think there would be a lot of objections [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1289.54s)]
*  to counting it as such. I think the other thing that's worth pointing out is remittances do create [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1294.8200000000002s)]
*  certain inequalities on the ground, right? There are certain families, certain communities that may [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1300.34s)]
*  be better connected to their diaspora back home. Those diaspora members may be doing better [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1304.8999999999999s)]
*  economically, in economies that are doing better, and there may be other communities in the same [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1311.1399999999999s)]
*  country, perhaps even neighbors in the same communities, who don't have those kinds of [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1316.4199999999998s)]
*  international linkages, and therefore their neighbor might be getting dollar-nominated cash [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1320.98s)]
*  infusions on a regular basis, while the neighbor might not. And so the governments of those [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1326.18s)]
*  countries need to also be sensitive to those inequalities and figure out how do we get [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1330.9s)]
*  remittance flows to work together to supplement public support, including what we call contingent [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1335.3s)]
*  finance, right? The infusion of quick cash in the aftermath, or in fact this preparation for a shock [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1342.5800000000002s)]
*  or a disaster. How do we get public and private dollars to work together? How do we get enough data [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1349.0600000000002s)]
*  to be able to do that so that everybody gets support and nobody's left behind? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1353.7s)]
*  Well said. A word of caution there. Sam, please. Well, thanks very much. I'd like to just jump in, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1359.7s)]
*  because I agree fully with what Leo just said about remittances of public climate finance, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1365.14s)]
*  and I think that for several reasons, as Leo has pointed out, that doesn't work. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1370.02s)]
*  But Lindsay had mentioned mobilizing private climate finance, and I think there's a case [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1374.26s)]
*  we made that in certain situations remittances could be classified as mobilized private climate [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1379.14s)]
*  finance. And I think one needs to be very careful here as well, because as Leo has pointed out, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1384.9s)]
*  remittances might not necessarily be used for purposes for which climate finance is required [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1389.7s)]
*  to be used, namely for either reducing vulnerability to climate shocks or for decreasing emissions of [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1395.14s)]
*  greenhouse gases. But at CGD we published a paper towards the end of last year which argued that if [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1401.94s)]
*  you took existing labor migration pathways with few prerequisites, such as, for example, seasonal [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1408.66s)]
*  agricultural worker visas, and targeted access to those visas towards highly climate vulnerable [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1416.1000000000001s)]
*  communities for which, for example, they would already be eligible for cash transfer programs, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1422.02s)]
*  a similar form of assistance, then the remittances that they generated by participating in that [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1428.98s)]
*  migration program, because they were targeted on the grounds of their climate vulnerability, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1437.14s)]
*  and because there is the intention for this money to be used to increase resilience, could be [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1442.5s)]
*  classified as mobilized private climate finance. And there are some considerations there as to [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1447.46s)]
*  the degree to which they would be classifiable as mobilized private climate finance under [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1452.42s)]
*  the OECD's regulations, whether it would be what's referred to as significant or principal, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1456.5800000000002s)]
*  which determines the percentage of that mobilized finance that could be classified as climate finance. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1463.94s)]
*  But in our research we felt that this would be legitimate, and that if you were targeting, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1470.42s)]
*  and only if you were targeting carefully and deliberately populations that had high climate [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1476.74s)]
*  vulnerability, the benefits could be enormous. There is pretty much no intervention that we have [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1482.02s)]
*  as a development community to improve people's lives that has such a high effect as access to [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1489.7s)]
*  land migration. If you assist somebody moving from rural Haiti or rural Honduras to, for example, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1495.22s)]
*  the United States to work on the HUA visa program, the remittances that they send back might increase [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1501.54s)]
*  their household income by matters of hundreds of percent. And there is pretty much no other [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1507.8600000000001s)]
*  intervention that we know of, no job creation program, no cash transfer program that can have [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1513.7s)]
*  that kind of impact. As Leo pointed out, that does involve a certain amount of inequality, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1518.1s)]
*  because a household that benefits from that will see their income go up enormously, and the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1523.3799999999999s)]
*  households, perhaps a few villages over, won't see that effect. But we also think that there [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1527.78s)]
*  would be significant spillover effects. That would have wider ripple benefits within that locale. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1533.54s)]
*  It remains to be seen exactly how that would work in practice. I think if this was ever trialed, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1539.4599999999998s)]
*  indeed it has been trialed in varying contexts a few times. And John is aware of a current mercy [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1545.7s)]
*  core program that is attempting to do something similar to that. But we think the effects will [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1552.1000000000001s)]
*  be quite large and that it could legitimately be caused private mobilized finance, if not public. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1555.7s)]
*  And you brought us back to the fact we kicked off with the remittances are just much larger than [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1561.8600000000001s)]
*  either foreign direct investment or official aid. And so we have to try to find ways to maybe to [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1565.6200000000001s)]
*  direct them better. But John, Sam teed you up to talk about some of these programs for [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1571.7s)]
*  directing remittances to climate action and matching them. You want to come in? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1576.74s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. I think going upstream a bit is where are the places that are most climate [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1581.14s)]
*  vulnerable or will be most climate vulnerable in the future. And I think the science is helping us [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1588.98s)]
*  loads there to figure that out. And then what we and others are working to do is to try to, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1593.46s)]
*  well, at a high level, just kind of reframe the debate around migration from those climate [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1599.3799999999999s)]
*  vulnerable areas as a failure of adaptation or development and more of as an important strategy [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1606.5s)]
*  that historically has allowed people to escape poverty and support development, as Sam outlined. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1611.3799999999999s)]
*  So one of the areas we're looking to do that is around South-South migration, which makes up the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1617.78s)]
*  majority of global migration, including climate driven variants of that. And particularly working [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1624.66s)]
*  to on the assumption that people are moving already. And are there ways that we can intervene [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1633.22s)]
*  that make it safer, more legal, more productive? And so we've been working with researchers from [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1639.38s)]
*  the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford and elsewhere for a number of years in West Africa, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1646.18s)]
*  particularly targeting potential out migrants from rural Niger. And this is an area that is [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1650.5s)]
*  part of the ECOWAS economic community where there is pretty free labor mobility. So it's a quite [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1657.94s)]
*  conducive policy environment there for South-South migration. And essentially what we're doing is [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1663.7s)]
*  designing and testing a package of support that would, again, kind of help young men overcome [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1669.3s)]
*  the barriers to moving within the region and then to help make sure that that results in [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1674.1s)]
*  improvements not just for them, but also the sort of descending families and communities. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1679.94s)]
*  So the package of support is, first and foremost, a cash transfer to help overcome some of the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1683.6200000000001s)]
*  financial constraints of simply making the journey safely. But there's also some legal documentation, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1688.42s)]
*  training and information on destinations and financial service providers, how to remit money [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1694.5800000000002s)]
*  back. And then a component that we're calling a household dialogue to help make sure that the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1700.5s)]
*  decisions around migration are made jointly as a family because we've seen some heightened [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1705.62s)]
*  vulnerability around families, parts of the family that are left behind. So this one, we're also in [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1710.34s)]
*  a kind of final data collection mode, but we have seen some pretty encouraging initial results, both [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1716.5s)]
*  on increases to out migration amongst participants, especially within the ECOWAS region. And then [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1721.06s)]
*  seeing initial signs that not only are they making more income than some of their peers, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1729.94s)]
*  but also that families back home are being more food secure and a few other sort of encouraging [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1736.3400000000001s)]
*  signs there that this migration is being more productive even early in the sort of migration [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1741.14s)]
*  journey. So this is another one where we see pretty wide potential for it, depending on the evidence [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1747.3s)]
*  that we do generate for other regions that have similar kind of labor mobility policies. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1754.42s)]
*  And then I think, yeah, the key is sort of tying it back into how can this benefit climate adaptation, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1762.26s)]
*  both in sending communities, are people investing in climates, more agriculture or other productive [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1768.5s)]
*  assets that minimize risk to climate shocks? Are they pooling funds for infrastructure, et cetera? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1775.38s)]
*  So I think it's sort of that complementary piece that we're continuing to try to explore as well. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1782.02s)]
*  But yeah, I'm really excited about that one. Thanks for teaming that up, Sam. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1786.26s)]
*  Sam Bracewitz Really interesting. And I mean, John, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1789.22s)]
*  you were talking mainly about helping without migration and sending the funds there. Lindsay, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1791.22s)]
*  there's a program I know you like that Mexico used to have. There was more targeting. You focused on [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1794.98s)]
*  the funds coming back in. If you want to share that one with the audience? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1798.74s)]
*  Lindsay Haas Sure. So the Mexican government back in, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1801.3s)]
*  I think it was 2002, launched a program that they called Tres Por Uno, Three for One. And basically, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1808.02s)]
*  it was a program that was designed to incentivize remittances from, or pooled remittances from [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1815.06s)]
*  hometown associations, mainly in the United States, to have them invest in projects, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1825.3799999999999s)]
*  social welfare projects, kind of more community benefit projects in their hometowns. And they [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1833.78s)]
*  incentivized this by matching, the Mexican government matched for every dollar, every peso, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1840.8999999999999s)]
*  that was sent back to Mexico for one of these projects. It was met at the federal level, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1849.3799999999999s)]
*  the state level, and the municipal level by one more dollar, or one more peso. And so it actually, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1854.26s)]
*  over the course of time, this was a, it's, I guess, in a way, a form of a public-private partnership, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1863.38s)]
*  in that it was an investment that the Mexican government at several levels was making to [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1870.1000000000001s)]
*  incentivize these types of projects in home communities. So projects covered the gamut from [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1877.46s)]
*  building up community centers, schools, health centers, but also infrastructure and electrification [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1884.5800000000002s)]
*  and so in many ways, you saw this, it's this kind of, as I was saying earlier, it's this way of [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1891.86s)]
*  catalyzing and amplifying the impact of the diaspora in a way that also can help meet the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1899.86s)]
*  development goals, or in many cases could be kind of climate adaptation and resilience goals that [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1908.4199999999998s)]
*  the government or even a locality can really have. Here you have, I mean, obviously some of the [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1914.74s)]
*  risks that Leo highlighted around kind of whether one municipality perhaps had more money than another [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1922.74s)]
*  and those sorts of things happened, but at the same time, it was a really great way of [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1932.26s)]
*  a government mobilizing limited resources to catalyze more investment in and really this kind [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1938.74s)]
*  of partnership that you saw. I think this is a great way to take some lessons learned from this, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1944.8999999999999s)]
*  over I think a period of almost two decades mobilized several hundred million dollars [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1951.78s)]
*  towards these types of investments. It's an interesting inverted form of blended finance, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1957.6200000000001s)]
*  where at least in the first instance you have private money crowding in public money and of [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1963.6200000000001s)]
*  course the failure of public money to crowd in as much private investment as expected or hoped is [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1966.74s)]
*  one reason for the climate finance gap that Leo brought in earlier. I want to go back a little [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1970.66s)]
*  bit to current affairs. The US Senate yesterday just passed the one big beautiful bill, which [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1974.9s)]
*  includes a tax on remittances. Vice President J.D. Vance was at a siding vote and I thought it was [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1981.06s)]
*  interesting because in 2023 when he was a senator, he introduced a bill that would have put a 10% [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1985.54s)]
*  tax on remittances, outbound remittances for non-US citizens with the amount collected going [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1990.1s)]
*  towards funding border enforcement. The US has a lot more money for border enforcement through this [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1994.6599999999999s)]
*  bill now, but Sam, maybe you could tell us why do small taxes on remittances or transaction costs [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=1998.8999999999999s)]
*  make such a big difference when we're just talking about one or two percent here? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2006.5s)]
*  Thanks. Yeah, they make a big difference in large part because people respond to increased costs of [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2010.1000000000001s)]
*  sending remittances by decreasing the amount that they send and exactly what that elasticity is equal [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2015.38s)]
*  to is I think slightly up for debate. There's been a number of studies that come up with [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2021.46s)]
*  slightly different numbers. The study that we opted to use at CGD suggests that for every 1% [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2025.94s)]
*  that the cost of remittances increases, remittance sending will decrease by approximately 1.6%. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2033.78s)]
*  So in the new bill that's just passed through the Senate and gone back to the House, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2041.06s)]
*  ultimately there's going to be a 1% tax on all remittances sent via a select number of [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2045.38s)]
*  vehicles by all people in the US, citizens and non-citizens alike. And for some countries that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2052.18s)]
*  have significant remittance flows coming from the US, that does equal quite a large amount of money. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2060.02s)]
*  For Mexico, that equals something in the region of 1.5 billion. Once you take into account both [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2066.34s)]
*  that tax and also that price effect. For El Salvador, it's equal to something in the region [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2070.9s)]
*  0.6% of GNI. So even if it does appear quite small, that does equal a lot. And one also, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2075.94s)]
*  of course, has to remember that this money that is being taxed when it is sent has normally already [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2083.38s)]
*  been taxed at source in people's paychecks. Interesting that this version of the tax [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2089.7s)]
*  falls not just on migrants, it hits US citizens as well. And maybe we'll push people towards [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2096.58s)]
*  alternative channels of payment or crypto. I guess the idea was to avoid people giving money to US [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2102.66s)]
*  citizens to send, but it's an interesting place that they've landed with this low fee that applies [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2107.54s)]
*  to everybody. We are going to do a few more questions. We have some audience questions [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2111.14s)]
*  coming in. We'll start those in about 10 minutes. Leo, shifting gear a little bit, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2117.22s)]
*  you just got back from a trip to Berlin where you were talking to the biggest multilateral [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2120.66s)]
*  climate funds about why they should devote resources to human mobility, which is what [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2124.02s)]
*  we're really talking about today. Can you tell us more about what you did on that trip and what you [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2127.62s)]
*  want them to do? Sure. Look, climate mobility, the idea that people will shift where they live and [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2130.8199999999997s)]
*  where they work on the basis of the impacts of climate used to be sort of a niche issue. It was [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2140.42s)]
*  seen as very complex and falling sort of between the silos of climate action, migration, policy [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2148.26s)]
*  and planning and humanitarian assistance. No longer. That is really beginning to change. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2155.78s)]
*  Those communities are coming together in a coherent dialogue and many countries are indeed [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2160.98s)]
*  signaling that they have plans and they have ambitions for climate mobility at home. If you [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2165.94s)]
*  look at the 53 national adaptation plans that have been created over the past 10 years, about [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2171.7000000000003s)]
*  two thirds of them have very specific concrete provisions about climate migration, displacement [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2179.46s)]
*  and relocation. If you look at the nationally determined contributions, the documents that [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2186.34s)]
*  countries prepare with their climate ambitions and their climate commitments, 40% of them talk [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2191.62s)]
*  about climate mobility. So there's clear demand for this. The financing community, especially [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2198.74s)]
*  including in the climate and development space, are noticing. They are starting to see this demand [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2203.7s)]
*  signal and as a result, they're trying to figure out how to respond. They're trying to figure out [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2208.18s)]
*  what kind of programs, what kind of financial instruments, what type of planning would help [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2213.94s)]
*  to develop projects and programs that help advance those ambitions. I think the key thing [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2219.14s)]
*  here is it can be a politically sensitive issue. It's important for many countries that climate [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2226.02s)]
*  mobility doesn't mean we're just giving up on adaptation. We should just sort of move you off [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2231.14s)]
*  to a different part, right? Nobody wants that. People are, communities are very tied to their [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2236.9s)]
*  geography by culture, by economics, by history. And so there has to be a very clear message that [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2242.18s)]
*  adaptation is still preferable wherever possible, wherever feasible, and that the right to stay is [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2247.86s)]
*  also part of this. But in many cases, climate mobility and thinking about the future is also [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2254.02s)]
*  an essential part of adaptation planning. The small island developing states get it. Many of them were [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2262.1800000000003s)]
*  in Berlin. They understand that. They have made peace with the fact that their geography in many [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2267.6200000000003s)]
*  cases will be under threat by sea level rise and saline intrusion and other climate impacts. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2272.5s)]
*  And so they are at the forefront of planning and at the forefront of talking to the financiers about [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2278.82s)]
*  how to make that possible. But then there are other countries that are not quite islands, but [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2283.62s)]
*  nevertheless are highly exposed to the impacts of climate change. Bangladesh, Guatemala, Costa Rica, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2289.06s)]
*  Colombia, the list goes on, who are also now interested in this issue. And they want to think [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2294.66s)]
*  about how to make their societies more frictionless to help that mobility be more effective. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2300.1s)]
*  And importantly, that it can happen in an anticipatory way before people are forcibly [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2306.98s)]
*  displaced by a climate related shock. And so overall, I think this, you see these communities [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2313.06s)]
*  waking up to this issue. It's a systemic type of adaptation intervention. And that's what countries [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2319.54s)]
*  are looking for now. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2325.7s)]
*  Monique's questions are coming in pretty thick and fast. So we're going to move to some of those now. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2328.8999999999996s)]
*  John, I think this first one might be for you. Someone's asking that given current financing [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2333.9399999999996s)]
*  trends, how should nonprofit or humanitarian organizations traditionally reliant on ODA and [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2338.66s)]
*  remittances prepare for the decrease in funding? Yeah, that's a multi-prong for sure. I mean, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2343.3799999999997s)]
*  I think the probably most straightforward answer is some version of collective action. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2352.58s)]
*  Take remittances in particular. I think there is a lot of instances where they end up getting [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2362.9s)]
*  pulled, whether it's from an explicit approach like the Mexican one that Lindsay mentioned, or [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2370.1s)]
*  just more through informal support networks. So we've seen remittances back to Niger, for example, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2377.06s)]
*  where we're working be used for water infrastructure or joint projects in that way. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2381.54s)]
*  So I think maybe the missing pieces are those sort of incentives to get funding used in that way, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2387.06s)]
*  whether those be matched or some type of a strategy document at a municipal level [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2394.18s)]
*  that they can lean into. I mean, I feel like right now we tend to kind of do this on a sort [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2402.9s)]
*  of progetized basis. And I feel like that's one of the least cost-effective ways to be able to [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2408.1s)]
*  support adaptation, especially given the current cuts and crunches. So I think moving as a [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2412.8199999999997s)]
*  collective action project alongside existing governance structures would be my first thought [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2419.7s)]
*  there. Another one here that might be good for you, Leo, when you were talking about small island [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2426.2599999999998s)]
*  states have been focused on this for a long time. They're the most vulnerable. These are smaller [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2433.54s)]
*  countries, but there's much larger countries where other actors might have to get involved. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2436.9s)]
*  I mean, you think of a place like Bangladesh, much, much bigger than Tuvalu, but maybe not [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2442.98s)]
*  as focused on it. The question here is, do you see potential for sub-national actors to play a larger [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2449.14s)]
*  role in leveraging remittances? Absolutely. And ultimately, the movement of people, both after a [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2454.42s)]
*  disaster and anticipatory movement, will happen in small geographic areas, mostly within countries, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2462.42s)]
*  from rural to urban areas, within urban areas, or in some cases from urban to urban areas. And that [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2472.02s)]
*  means ultimately that the capacity of those communities, the receiving communities, to [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2478.42s)]
*  successfully absorb those new flows depend on their own capacity to accommodate growth. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2483.7000000000003s)]
*  And so ultimately, this has a lot to do with city planning and urban development. And how do we make [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2491.86s)]
*  sure that those cities have the investments in place for education, for health, for transportation, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2497.46s)]
*  for infrastructure, for housing, that will allow those cities to be more flexible, more open in [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2503.54s)]
*  doing this? And of course, it matters, the size matters a lot. After Hurricane Katrina hit New [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2510.82s)]
*  Orleans, about a million people were displaced from the city. Roughly half of those settled in [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2516.18s)]
*  Houston. Houston was at that point one of the biggest cities in the country and was able to [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2521.2999999999997s)]
*  absorb folks in pretty naturally. They looked at the impact of the inflow of 500,000 folks from [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2527.7s)]
*  Louisiana, and the effect was very small. The large economy was able to absorb it. But had it not been [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2537.8599999999997s)]
*  Houston, had it been a smaller city, a smaller community, the impact would have been higher and [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2543.54s)]
*  more difficult to absorb. And so it's important to start thinking about what are those receiving [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2549.38s)]
*  communities going to need in terms of investment so that they are able to make those accommodations. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2553.62s)]
*  And this is not just an economic issue. It's also a social one. Ultimately, what we want is for [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2561.22s)]
*  people in receiving communities to see those who are coming in displaced by climate or other [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2567.54s)]
*  reasons as fellow citizens, fellow human beings, who are accommodated and received and supported, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2572.42s)]
*  not as outsiders, not as folks who are seen with resentment or who are seen as economic competition [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2581.46s)]
*  for jobs or other things, which will create, of course, enmity and the type of ugly discourse [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2588.02s)]
*  that is not going to help in this climate mobility world. And regardless of whether they're from [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2594.98s)]
*  cross-border migration or inside their own countries. And so that's why this really matters. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2601.06s)]
*  Well, it's sort of expanding the circle of empathy. It may be a little easier with [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2606.9s)]
*  internal migration when people are not seen as foreigners, at least in a national sense. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2610.2599999999998s)]
*  I want to tie together a theme that's in a couple of the questions here. We really have [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2615.38s)]
*  viewers asking for examples of remittances, either examples of remittances helping people [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2619.06s)]
*  rebuild after disasters or maybe favorite examples you guys have of remittances building up [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2625.62s)]
*  resilience. So that's really one for everyone. Maybe Sam or Lindsay, any favorite examples, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2630.5s)]
*  you know, studies you've seen in the past on the importance of remittances after disasters. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2635.3s)]
*  Sure, I can kick us off there. There was a fantastic study by Felicitas Hillman and others [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2642.74s)]
*  of how remittances are used by the UAE community in Ghana after coastal shocks, after high tides [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2649.7s)]
*  and storms where their beachside houses were washed away. And through community pooling efforts, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2657.86s)]
*  often organized by senior community leaders who are actually members of the diaspora themselves, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2664.18s)]
*  increased remittance flows to this specific community through their networks helped them to [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2669.7s)]
*  relocate and to rebuild better houses that were more durable. And we see on the flip side of that [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2674.5s)]
*  similar stories, especially in Pacific Island states, where households that receive remittances [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2680.42s)]
*  often have, for example, concrete foundations on their houses or metal roofs that are much more [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2686.02s)]
*  resilient to storms as well. So make the need for post-disaster relocation much less pressing. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2692.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I would just, the only thing I'd, I mean, I think you see this with every major natural [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2700.2599999999998s)]
*  disaster. You saw this a lot in the floods in Pakistan, that the diaspora, particularly [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2705.14s)]
*  in acting with pooled funds and kind of in a philanthropic way, rush in and put and dedicate [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2713.14s)]
*  a lot of funds to recovery. I think one of the important pieces though too here is just really [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2719.7s)]
*  figuring out and compiling good practices that will help ensure and incentivize that that type of [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2726.8999999999996s)]
*  post-disaster recovery is really, when it comes in through all of these different [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2734.98s)]
*  foundations, or sorry, comes in through all these different sources, that it's really going and it's [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2741.46s)]
*  being reinvested in ways that are not replicating the same vulnerabilities that led to displacement [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2747.7000000000003s)]
*  and other things happening in the first place. So if you are rebuilding infrastructure, that that is [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2753.78s)]
*  climate resilient infrastructure. If you're rebuilding schools, making sure that those [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2758.9s)]
*  are really important and ready to go and can withstand another shock if that's to happen. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2764.58s)]
*  And kind of thinking, taking a bit more of a coordinated approach, which again is a good, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2770.02s)]
*  that shows the importance of having a multi-stakeholder approach to any of these [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2777.54s)]
*  actions, whether it's any actions that are met by the diaspora, bringing in good planning and [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2783.3s)]
*  coordination with local actors and even national governments on that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2790.1800000000003s)]
*  The Pakistan example is a really powerful one. I mean the floods were so terrible in 2022 and it's [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2795.6200000000003s)]
*  such a large country with such a large diaspora, and then you saw a correspondingly large amount [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2799.94s)]
*  of funds coming in that really made a big difference. Here's a question for the whole [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2803.86s)]
*  group about innovative financial tools. We have a viewer asking, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2808.26s)]
*  are there tools like diaspora bonds or insurance products that could be scaled up to supplement [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2812.1800000000003s)]
*  remittance flows? Maybe I'll jump in just quickly here. I mean I think having a toolbox of options [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2816.5s)]
*  is I think really critical. There is of course on kind of an individualized basis, if you want to [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2828.5800000000004s)]
*  incentivize investment, individual remittances towards certain actions, offering certain [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2836.58s)]
*  financial products that can, we're all rational actors when we're engaging in purchases and things [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2842.8199999999997s)]
*  like that. So incentivize, offering insurance that at a cost that can maybe, if I'm sending money to [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2851.54s)]
*  my family, I want to make sure that if I'm investing in, if I'm investing in a house, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2860.1s)]
*  I'm investing in solar panels or something along those lines, that I have access to insurance so [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2867.7s)]
*  that if something happens again, that that investment is not lost. So I think there are [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2872.9s)]
*  financial tools and products on an individual basis, but even zooming out, there are many [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2879.14s)]
*  different tools that you can use. And some of them, you can take a mashup of approaches, right? So [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2884.58s)]
*  you can have diaspora investments that are met with blended finance, in a blended finance kind [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2891.7s)]
*  of approach where you're having the diaspora and private sector, private capital coming in, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2900.02s)]
*  and that's de-risked perhaps by philanthropy that may want to come in and help that. Or even some of [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2906.98s)]
*  you know, finance, international development finance actors who may want to come in and de-risk [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2914.74s)]
*  these sorts of things. So I think really having a full toolbox, you can't rely on one source [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2919.46s)]
*  to solve the problem. We really have to bring as many to the table as possible. So, you know, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2925.38s)]
*  debt swaps, blended finance, all of these things need to be considered to really catalyze and ensure [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2930.42s)]
*  that all of the actors are at the table. Anyone else on innovative tools? John, Mary? Leo, please. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2936.98s)]
*  I think in terms of priorities, I would say number one is of course, for all of us to do what we can [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2948.02s)]
*  to make sure that remittances are not impeded and the costs increased on sending, right? Whether [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2953.06s)]
*  it's government imposed taxes or it's the private actors putting their own fees on things, that [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2959.38s)]
*  there is no better way to incentivize the flows, as Sam said, than keeping the cost low. The second [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2967.62s)]
*  is if we do engage in innovative financial approaches, I would say keep it simple. If the [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2974.34s)]
*  mechanism becomes too complex, you're just going to scare off the remittance senders, right? They [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2981.54s)]
*  might be reluctant to put their money in things they don't understand. That was the advantage of [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2986.1s)]
*  the Tres Por Uno program. It was simple. You could explain it on the postcard and people relied on [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2990.18s)]
*  that understanding to go with it. And lastly, I would say there's a lot of room for innovation in [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=2997.06s)]
*  the public mechanisms. A lot of countries are now looking at catastrophe bonds, at parametric [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3002.98s)]
*  insurance. They're looking at fastest-bursing loans from the World Bank and other multilaterals. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3010.1s)]
*  And these are all ways to get quick infusions of capital into countries in the aftermath of [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3016.18s)]
*  disasters. And as I said earlier, they have to be coordinated and complemented in a way that they [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3021.22s)]
*  act in concert with and in coordination with the remittance flows. That's how you get maximum [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3026.98s)]
*  firepower and how you get both public and private flows working together. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3033.38s)]
*  We've got a tough question here. You know, we talked about some of the drawbacks of our forced [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3040.18s)]
*  reliance on remittances earlier. And someone points out that remittances are often used for [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3044.1s)]
*  immediate household needs. And they're asking about strategies for communities to channel them [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3047.94s)]
*  towards longer-term needs like climate without restricting the use of such funds for education [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3052.5s)]
*  or housing. Any thoughts on that? I mean, a quick one drawing more on the evidence base [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3056.74s)]
*  for cash transfers generally. I mean, we see that not only is it a preferred modality of [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3064.8199999999997s)]
*  assistance, but that it generally gets used even when it's unconditional, meaning not [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3071.78s)]
*  sort of slated for a particular purpose for things that support families, whether that's [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3077.46s)]
*  immediate needs, if that's what's needed, or longer-term investments in agricultural productive [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3081.3s)]
*  assets. And so I think, again, the evidence here is pretty reassuring that remittances would not be [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3086.9s)]
*  or aren't an exception to that. I know there are some sort of mindset shifts, so maybe sort of [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3093.7000000000003s)]
*  labeling kind of nudges might be something to explore. But in general, I don't think that [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3099.06s)]
*  reflects the reality of how we see it. At least cash transfers generally get used, including for [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3106.26s)]
*  longer terms, in the resilience bill. On bonus points for you, you kind of answered another one [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3110.82s)]
*  of the questions asking whether remittances should be channeled through nonprofits or direct [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3114.7400000000002s)]
*  transfers to households. But I think you covered that with cash transfers a little bit. We have a [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3118.82s)]
*  question here about, you know, we're talking about using remittances for climate action. We have a [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3124.02s)]
*  viewer asking if policymakers should be concerned about people using remittances to support continued [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3127.46s)]
*  risky behavior, like rebuilding in the same location, if anyone has thoughts on that, or using [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3132.18s)]
*  them to invest in projects detrimental to climate adaptation or mitigation. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3136.5s)]
*  I can jump in on that. I mean, we have seen that sort of behavior in many locations. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3145.3s)]
*  Remittances, indeed, just resources in general, can often be used for maladaptation, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3150.1s)]
*  for example, drilling too many boreholes in an area that the groundwater reservoirs can support. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3155.54s)]
*  Or, as the questioner notes, rebuilding in an area that's recently been hit by disaster. I think [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3163.94s)]
*  there are definitely actions that policymakers can take. They can mount communication programs, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3169.14s)]
*  for example. And we know that in the context of cash transfer programs, pairing a cash transfer [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3174.2599999999998s)]
*  with some kind of communication module that suggests to recipients ways in which it could [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3179.54s)]
*  best be used can have some quite significant effects. And I think that policymakers can try [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3184.98s)]
*  to guide remittances through that as well. And especially through forms of essentially soft [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3190.42s)]
*  interventions in which they work with community leaders to ensure that people are informed [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3195.62s)]
*  of how remittances should best be used in different contexts. And we've seen that work quite well in [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3200.42s)]
*  the Pacific in particular, where if you can bring community leaders on board, and if people can have [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3204.74s)]
*  trust that the information that they're receiving, that the opportunities that have been presented [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3209.46s)]
*  with are legitimate, then they're going to be more likely to take action. And then on the other [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3213.78s)]
*  hand, you also have the harder measures such as zoning regulations. But that often becomes much [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3219.78s)]
*  more complex. We're almost out of time. So I'm going to want to close with a lightning round. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3225.06s)]
*  I find there's always something that I don't ask you or a point that panelists want to make and [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3230.1s)]
*  didn't get to. So we're just going to have the floor for a closing point, something you want to [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3234.26s)]
*  share on this really broad topic remittances in the climate finance crisis. Lindsay, anything we [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3238.18s)]
*  didn't talk about? I think the one thing that I would just flag too, we focused a lot on funding [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3242.2599999999998s)]
*  for projects in people's home countries. But in a world where we have such great human mobility, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3252.74s)]
*  and there are a number of host countries, refugee host countries, migrant host countries, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3262.58s)]
*  that also are themselves very vulnerable to climate change. I think that this is something [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3268.5s)]
*  that those countries should be thinking about as well. And even at the subnational level, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3274.4199999999996s)]
*  to Leo's point, you've had some of the most innovative approaches happening at that very [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3280.58s)]
*  local level, both in terms of welcoming refugees and migrants, as well as adapting [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3285.7s)]
*  and building resilience to climate change. Really focusing, I think, also some attention on those [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3292.98s)]
*  receiving countries and how they can really catalyze the actions of the diaspora would be [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3298.74s)]
*  really helpful as well. Thanks so much. That's a really good one, Lindsay. John, last word from you, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3306.98s)]
*  what didn't we get to? Yeah, I think it's actually a version of the question on, hey, how do we do [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3312.1s)]
*  more with less in this moment? And I guess, yes, there are some sort of tweaks to the plumbing we [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3318.02s)]
*  can make for efficiencies and cost effectiveness. But I think actually right now, working on stopping [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3324.98s)]
*  the hemorrhaging of the sort of the spigots and keeping those open, or where there are going to [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3334.02s)]
*  be cuts, let's say, UK and Germany, trying to help them make smart cuts so that cost-effective [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3338.34s)]
*  investments in adaptation and mobility stay in the mix. So I guess, even as an operational [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3344.42s)]
*  person in an NGO, I think actually some of the important policy work to be able to keep funding [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3351.86s)]
*  flowing or protect some of those important longer-term pots is crucial. Well said. Leo, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3358.26s)]
*  last word from you, what did we miss? I think it's very difficult to ignore the fact that there's [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3365.46s)]
*  a concerted and systematic effort to make it very difficult for people to work in the United States [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3372.66s)]
*  from other countries. And that is going to have, I think, a long-term effect on the flows of [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3378.5s)]
*  reminiscence. So I think it's useful perhaps now to start thinking about how to model that [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3384.58s)]
*  and how to think of alternatives and what the development and other aspects will be downstream. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3390.34s)]
*  Yeah, you can't have this conversation today and I'll think about that. I mean, the proposed budget [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3399.94s)]
*  for ICE is close to $50 billion. I think it's more than the Marines and it's more than the GDP [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3404.42s)]
*  of some of the countries we're talking about. So it's worrying stuff for many reasons. Sam, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3409.5400000000004s)]
*  take us home. What didn't we get to today? Well, I'm afraid I'm going to reiterate something, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3415.22s)]
*  which is simply that people need to have the opportunity to migrate. Many of the people who [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3420.98s)]
*  are in climate-bundleable communities don't have access to labour migration. They can't afford it. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3425.4599999999996s)]
*  They might not have a passport. If these opportunities can be brought to them, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3432.98s)]
*  then they can have enormous implications, enormous positive implications. And that's something that [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3437.14s)]
*  countries of destination really do have the ability to affect. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3442.58s)]
*  Countries have trade rep-sensitives which seek to support lower income countries in accessing [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3446.2599999999998s)]
*  favorable trade terms. They could have a migration rep-sensitive that tries to direct these huge [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3452.74s)]
*  opportunities to countries that are affected by climate change as well. Another good one. Yeah, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3456.98s)]
*  we're going to stay hopeful and keep working on it, but we are out of time. So I want to thank [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3462.34s)]
*  all our panelists, Lindsay, Sam, John, Leo, and also thank all of you viewers for spending the [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3466.18s)]
*  hour with us and putting in your questions. So come back next time for another Carnegie [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3471.7s)]
*  Dama conversation. My name is Noah Gordon, and thanks so much for being here. Bye, everyone. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3475.22s)]
*  Thanks so much. Thanks. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK1WocYOgVc&t=3480.98s)]
