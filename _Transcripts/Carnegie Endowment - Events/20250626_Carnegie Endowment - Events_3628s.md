Video Description: Solidarity among advanced market democracies, collectively known as “the West,” has underpinned the post-1945 liberal international order. Those foundations, already eroding, are now crumbling. Under President Donald J. Trump, the United States has abandoned aspirations to international leadership and is charting an “America First” course that promises to upend longstanding alliances, multilateral institutions, and commercial arrangements. With America no longer seeking to anchor world order, its closest partners are feeling unmoored. “The West as we know it is dead,” declares Ursula van der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.  
What are the roots of this growing estrangement, and how is it expressing itself? How is the fragmentation of the West shaping NATO, the G7, and U.S.-EU relations? What strategies are America’s erstwhile allies and partners adopting to hedge (or even balance) against an unpredictable United States? As America retrenches, what openings might arise for other Western and non-Western powers to advance their visions and preferences for multilateral institutions, international cooperation, and global order? 
Join Stewart Patrick in conversation with Rosa Balfour and Sophia Besch of the Carnegie Endowment and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute as they unpack the recent NATO and G7 summits—and what they tell us about the fate of the West.

# Does the West Still Exist? Reflections on the NATO and G7 Summit
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I)
*  Welcome to this Carnegie meeting on the provocative topic, does the West still exist? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Stuart Patrick, senior fellow and director of the Global Order and Institutions program [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=18.84s)]
*  here at the Carnegie Endowment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=22.72s)]
*  My idea in organizing this event was to assess the cohesion and solidarity of the community [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=24.5s)]
*  of advanced market democracies that has constituted the core of the U.S.-led liberal international [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=30.2s)]
*  order since the 1940s, both during and then after the Cold War. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=35.94s)]
*  It's become commonplace, as you know, to speak in recent years about living in a post-Western [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=41.56s)]
*  world. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=46.94s)]
*  But the past several months suggest that this might be true in more ways than one. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=48.1s)]
*  When most people use the expression post-Western, they're highlighting the rise of the so-called [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=54.18s)]
*  rest, that is the emergence of an array of non-Western global and regional powers, most [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=57.9s)]
*  notably China, of course, but also encompassing India, Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=64.22s)]
*  and many others. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  But alongside the rise of the rest, the question that is before us is whether or not we're [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=71.02s)]
*  seeing, at least in some regards, the demise of the West as a coherent and meaningful geopolitical [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=75.74s)]
*  entity. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=81.18s)]
*  Are we witnessing the disintegration of this tight-knit club of like-minded countries [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=82.4s)]
*  that has been the anchor of an open, rule-based international system since 1945? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  And if so, do we need a new organizing concept or framework for thinking about world order [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  and the foundations of international cooperation? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  So some big-picture questions, and the motivation for this conversation is, of course, the Trump [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=98.64000000000001s)]
*  revolution in American foreign policy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=102.54s)]
*  The president, of course, has adopted an avowedly America-first foreign national security and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  international economic policy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=110.84s)]
*  It is hyper-nationalist, it's unilateral, it's sovereignist, and it's transactional [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=111.84s)]
*  in its ethos. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=116.84s)]
*  In contrast to his predecessors, the president rarely speaks about U.S. global leadership [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=118.36s)]
*  and responsibility. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=123.12s)]
*  He doesn't say a lot about democracy, human rights, and development, and he often expresses [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=124.12s)]
*  disdain for alliances, multilateralism, and international law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=129.16s)]
*  And finally, he's skeptical about America's historic role in helping contribute to global [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=133.64s)]
*  public goods from open trade to international U.N. peacekeeping. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=139.04s)]
*  So these abrupt shifts have sent shockwaves through America's traditional democratic [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=143.48s)]
*  partners, including, of course, in Europe, in Canada, and in the Asia Pacific. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=150.48s)]
*  In April, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, bluntly declared the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=154.68s)]
*  West as we know it no longer exists. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=159.0s)]
*  Now the other possibility is that things are, we should stop clutching our pearls and things [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=161.76s)]
*  aren't nearly so dire, right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  We should all take a deep breath and recognize that the West continues to exist as a coherent [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  entity. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=173.16s)]
*  Given recent events, including the just-finished NATO summit, the previous G7 summit in Kananaskis, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=174.16s)]
*  Canada, ongoing U.S.-EU disputes over tariffs, and of course the unilateral U.S. bombing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=180.48s)]
*  of nuclear sites in Iran, it seemed like it was an opportune moment to take a step back [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=187.04s)]
*  and consider the health, the coherence, and the heft of the West as we've known it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=191.28s)]
*  Fortunately, we have three wonderful experts who are extremely well-placed to address this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=196.28s)]
*  topic. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=199.84s)]
*  Sophia Besh is a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, where she focuses on European defense policy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=200.84s)]
*  and transatlantic relations. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=207.96s)]
*  Rosa Balfour is a senior fellow and director of the Carnegie Europe Center, which is our [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=209.92s)]
*  outpost in Brussels. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=214.48s)]
*  And finally, Corrie Schaake is a senior fellow and director of the Foreign and Defense Policy [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=216.12s)]
*  Studies at the American Enterprise Institute right next door to us here in Washington. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=220.98s)]
*  Corrie is also the author of an excellent and relevant new foreign affairs piece, Dispensable [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=225.76s)]
*  Nation, America and a Post-American World. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=229.84s)]
*  So I'm really looking forward to being able to engage all of you in conversation. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  So welcome. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  I want to begin by asking each of you to reflect broadly on the state of relations amongst [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=240.2s)]
*  Western countries in the context of the Trump revolution. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=244.32s)]
*  And I'd like to start with Sophia and then move to Rosa and then to Corrie. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=247.4s)]
*  So Sophia, can you tell us a little bit about, in your mind, how big of a shock has Trump [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=252.64s)]
*  2.0 been to Europe? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=257.84s)]
*  As we know, historically, relations between the US and its partners have ebbed and flowed, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=260.88s)]
*  whether in crises like Nixon closing the gold window, the Euro Missile Crisis, or the Iraq [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=265.2s)]
*  War. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=270.76s)]
*  What's your assessment about the health and solidity of the West as you interpret that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=271.76s)]
*  concept? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=275.56s)]
*  Yes, thank you so much, Stuart. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=276.56s)]
*  Thank you for convening us all. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=279.44s)]
*  I suspect we're all part of many, many NATO summit and G7 summit debriefs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  And so it's a real joy to be able to think a bit more ambitiously about the broader context [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=286.6s)]
*  here. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=291.56s)]
*  And it's such a pleasure to be on the same time as Corrie and Rosa. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=292.56s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  So how much of a shock has it been? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  What is my assessment of the West? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=300.24s)]
*  Pretty big question to start with. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  I'll try to discipline myself and be fairly brief. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=303.44s)]
*  I think that Trump's return to the White House has been less a surprise than a confirmation [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=306.48s)]
*  of sort of Western allies' worst fears. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=311.48s)]
*  His first term has obviously already eroded trust in US reliability. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=315.12s)]
*  And I do think that many European leaders did hope that 2020 would mark a course correction. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=319.12s)]
*  But I do think that we have moved past the shock, the fact that President Trump is back [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=324.08s)]
*  and unapologetically so, has, I think, engendered a pretty profound psychological and strategic [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=330.35999999999996s)]
*  paradigm shift in many of America's closest Western partners. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  And what we're seeing is that this time it's not just about unpredictability or rhetorical [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=340.4s)]
*  attacks on NATO. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=344.67999999999995s)]
*  It's about the structural recognition that the United States may no longer be a consistent [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  anchor of the Western alliance system. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=350.28s)]
*  Trump, 2.0, has doubled down on America first on rejecting multilateralism, questioning [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=353.08s)]
*  defence commitments, openly sympathising with leaders like Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  And we've seen really interesting illustrations, I think, with the G7 and the NATO summit of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  how leaders are trying to deal with this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=367.56s)]
*  They've both managed, tried to manage the current moments, I think, in very different ways. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=370.12s)]
*  Neither, to my mind, has signalled real strength of the West. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=375.04s)]
*  I think the G7 aimed for normalcy and failed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  We've had no joint communiqué. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=382.8s)]
*  We've had little coherence. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=384.32s)]
*  There was a clear sense that the action was elsewhere, very explicitly for President Trump. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=385.56s)]
*  He wanted to solve policy problems and he left the meeting to do that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=389.76s)]
*  And then the NATO summit went very minimalist with just a two and a half hours meeting, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=393.64s)]
*  carefully choreographed to avoid friction and hand President Trump a win. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=399.2s)]
*  But we had no new Russia strategy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  We had barely a word on Ukraine. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=405.28s)]
*  I think both summits in their own way revealed a West that is more focused on managing internal [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  tension than projecting unity or purpose. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=411.12s)]
*  I want to just two quick points. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=414.64s)]
*  One, and you've alluded to this in your opening remarks, Stuart, we don't have to spend a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=416.96s)]
*  lot of time on this, but I do think to really assess the health of the West, we have to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=422.08s)]
*  look beyond transatlantic politics under President Trump. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=425.68s)]
*  There is a real crisis of global legitimacy of this concept with powers like India, Brazil, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=428.68s)]
*  Indonesia, African states calling out double standards, rejecting the notion that the West [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=434.64s)]
*  has a monopoly on universal norms. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think the uncomfortable truth is that much of the global South sees no contradiction [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=442.36s)]
*  between President Trump's America and the Western order. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=447.0s)]
*  It sees continuity, right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=449.92s)]
*  A West that preaches democracy while cutting deals with autocrats, that invokes rules by [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=451.2s)]
*  breaking them when convenient. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=455.52s)]
*  So in that sense, President Trump maybe doesn't so much undermine the West's normative credibility [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=457.08s)]
*  as he reveals its fragility. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=462.12s)]
*  He's not the exception. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=465.64s)]
*  He's the mask slipping. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=467.12s)]
*  I think that's how many countries around the world would see it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=468.56s)]
*  And this is not just about the United States, by the way. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=472.52s)]
*  I mean, the lackluster European response to first Israel's actions in Gaza and then the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=474.4s)]
*  Israeli-American strikes against Iran, the sense that there is no real European ambition [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=478.68s)]
*  to uphold an order that the US has tapped out of, most starkly put by Germany's Chancellor [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=483.32s)]
*  Merckx when he thanked Israel for doing Europe's dirty work. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=488.88s)]
*  All that, I think, is seen and registered by a broader world. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=492.0s)]
*  And that broader context matters because it means that the West isn't just divided, it's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=495.68s)]
*  isolated, right? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  It's fragmented within and no longer capable of projecting a coherent, appealing model [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  outward. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=505.64s)]
*  And this goes to my third and final point. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=507.24s)]
*  I think we might, we at least need to consider the possibility that a new kind of transatlantic [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=509.48s)]
*  alignment is emerging, not the old liberal one, but an illiberal one, with the MAGA [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=515.92s)]
*  movement in the US finding ideological allies and far-right parties across Europe that share [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=521.32s)]
*  a worldview rooted not in democracy or human rights, but in nationalism, anti-globalism, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=526.8s)]
*  cultural grievance, resentment, really. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=532.88s)]
*  I don't know what we want to call this, if it's the new West or the revisionist West [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=535.96s)]
*  or the pseudo West or the wild West. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=539.84s)]
*  I'm throwing out different ideas. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=542.48s)]
*  But in that sense, the West still exists. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=544.48s)]
*  But I think in terms of political purpose, moral coherence, global influence, it's not [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=547.48s)]
*  just weakened, it's contested both from without and from within. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=553.4s)]
*  Extremely useful. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=560.16s)]
*  So we have great observations. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=561.16s)]
*  The issue of whether or not Donald Trump is simply saying the quiet part out loud, that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=563.48s)]
*  in terms of the masks slipping from the perspective of a lot of other countries, I've certainly [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  heard that quite a bit. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=573.44s)]
*  And this notion also that there may be an internal debate in addition to the divisions [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=574.5200000000001s)]
*  between Western countries and notably transatlantic divisions. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=584.2s)]
*  There also are increasing debates over what the West should stand for to the degree that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=587.84s)]
*  it exists. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=591.84s)]
*  And we can pick up on some of these points. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=592.84s)]
*  Rosa, can I turn to you now? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=593.84s)]
*  When you think historically, and you've attended a number of different estimates, obviously, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=597.44s)]
*  and have been an observer of transatlantic relations for so long, do you feel like there's [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=603.6s)]
*  something qualitatively different about this current moment in terms of maybe an inflection [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=608.4s)]
*  point along the lines that Scipio was discussing? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=613.56s)]
*  I'd be really interested in areas where solidarity is most tested. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  And as trust has been declining, have you seen important shifts or even hedging by Western [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=622.64s)]
*  partners? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=627.8s)]
*  I realize I put a lot on the table, but I'd love to hear your perspectives on how you [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  see this moment with respect to the West. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  So let me just start. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  I really agree with the way in which Sofia framed this about the shock and awe at what's [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  happening, but also the structural shifts and the degree to which Europeans have become [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  cognizant that this time is different. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=650.76s)]
*  In this sense, I'm kind of trying to answer your question in the sense that it goes deeper, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=654.2s)]
*  it's more structural, and it's likely to shape. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=661.88s)]
*  Trump's decisions are likely to shape some kind of new world order. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=669.04s)]
*  We don't actually know what that order or disorder is going to look like at the moment. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=673.12s)]
*  There's more disorder than not, but there is something paradoxical. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=677.4s)]
*  I've just come back from the NATO summit, and there is something paradoxical about all [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=682.5999999999999s)]
*  these summits that have taken place. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=685.8s)]
*  On the one hand, it looks to us that the decisions of the United States are basically the twilight [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=687.5999999999999s)]
*  of US hegemony and that we're going to be moving into a different world order in which [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=696.3599999999999s)]
*  other powers are going to be much more influential. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=702.68s)]
*  And looking at things from Brussels, the big question is, where does Europe want to fit [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=705.9599999999999s)]
*  in this and in which areas does it want to try and seek a niche or some leadership, etc. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=710.36s)]
*  But on the other hand, we've also seen this extraordinary spectacle of European leaders [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  and NATO allies coming together to make sure that they bring the goodies for monarch Trump [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=725.16s)]
*  or daddy Trump, as the Secretary General of NATO put it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=733.3199999999999s)]
*  So to make sure that the US remains committed to NATO, remains committed to its alliances. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=739.16s)]
*  So all the sort of performative politics that are taking place around the US president are [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=746.36s)]
*  very much about trying to reassure themselves and the world that the West is still there. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=753.8s)]
*  So it's actually quite a paradoxical moment, because on the one hand, if you look at structural [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=760.68s)]
*  trends, this looks like the US abandoning its global security role. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=766.76s)]
*  It looks like the US abandoning its traditional allies. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=776.04s)]
*  It looks like the US is very much tempted by isolationism and we're all reading about [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=779.96s)]
*  the groups within the Republican Party that are influencing the president. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=785.56s)]
*  But on the other hand, everything that all the other leaders are doing is trying to maintain [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=791.24s)]
*  that and try to perform in such a way that the US does not leave. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=795.0s)]
*  So I feel that we're in a somewhat paradoxical moment. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=799.08s)]
*  And from looking at it from Brussels and from a European perspective, I'm not entirely, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=804.44s)]
*  it's not entirely clear where Europe actually intends to go in this sort of shifting space. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=810.84s)]
*  Hi, Mone, can I just come back to you on that? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=820.52s)]
*  You know, there's always been a debate, I don't have to sell someone from Brussels, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=825.0799999999999s)]
*  about Europe as an integrated Europe, as a coherent, cohesive entity, and a gallist version [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=828.68s)]
*  of a Europe des patrie, Europe of the nation states. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=837.4799999999999s)]
*  And do you, how do you think about that in terms, I mean, obviously there are many [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=840.28s)]
*  divisions and tensions within the 27 members of the bloc, but I'm interested in how you [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=846.84s)]
*  conceive of Europe as whether it's taking sort of more of a unified position or is this really [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=853.24s)]
*  sort of vanguard nation states and the big powers who will ultimately determine which [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=861.72s)]
*  direction this goes in? Yeah, no, you're quite right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=866.52s)]
*  The European Union and the way in which politics in this continent have functioned has always [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=871.5600000000001s)]
*  been very divisive, so it's quite hard sometimes to see the sense of direction. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=875.8s)]
*  There's different readings of this. One is, and I would say these different readings slightly [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=882.68s)]
*  reflect the sort of three big groups that, you know, and the one that will dominate or [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  will be most persuasive will probably shape where Europe goes. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=894.76s)]
*  And the first group is, this is a moment that Europeans need to seize, we need to work on [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=898.8399999999999s)]
*  building our security and defense capabilities, we need to work on rejuvenating and upscaling [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=906.28s)]
*  the economy so that we can continue to be a relevant and influential economic factor. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=915.8s)]
*  And this is the moment to do this. And, you know, there is a group, we've seen that, for instance, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=923.8s)]
*  a coalition of the willing coming together after the meeting between President Trump [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=930.28s)]
*  and President Zelensky in the White House in February. We've seen that there was a lot of [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  political energy and momentum around this. This coalition of the willing could also be, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=943.64s)]
*  and it includes EU members, but also non-EU members. This could be the driving force [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=948.36s)]
*  between, towards, you know, building up security and defense capabilities, trying to face [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=953.96s)]
*  the Russian threat. And this could be led by this group of countries. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=961.48s)]
*  So in other areas, you might have another coalition of the willing that is formed to look, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=965.64s)]
*  for instance, at how the moment can be seized for, you know, investments in security and defense to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=971.88s)]
*  also reenergize the economy, to bring some new funding into innovation and technology. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=979.08s)]
*  And then you might see other types of coalitions of the willing moving forward. So that is the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=988.2s)]
*  likely picture that I see in the future. But there are two more groups in Europe that are also [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=994.76s)]
*  politically influential. The first is the pro-Trumpians, and Sophia was also alluding [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1001.64s)]
*  to them. There are several political actors in Europe who actually say, well, this is what we've [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1008.28s)]
*  been arguing for three decades. Some of these political actors have actually been influential [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1013.0799999999999s)]
*  in the United States. I'm thinking of Viktor Orban and everything he's done to cultivate [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1019.0s)]
*  the Trump base and to inspire the Trump base with several ideas. So these actors are actively [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1024.52s)]
*  working against a greater European integration. They're actively working against European projects [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1032.92s)]
*  that would bring European states closer together. And then, of course, there's another group, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1038.76s)]
*  and that is the transatlanticists, the traditional transatlanticists. And these [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1044.44s)]
*  could be, at the moment, they have been perhaps the most shocked by what has been happening in [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1049.64s)]
*  Washington. But they are also perhaps the most attached to the transatlantic relationship. So [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1055.48s)]
*  in three years' time, they might be the transatlantic nostalgics who will want to, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1062.68s)]
*  or will push towards a return to the status quo antes should there be a change of government [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1069.0s)]
*  in the United States. So I think this is a moment certainly of opportunity, but you have these [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1075.5600000000002s)]
*  different groups and different opinions in Europe, and it's not always clear which one is going to [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1083.16s)]
*  prevail. Superb. Thank you so much, Rosa, for that. Cory, in addition to feeling free to comment on [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1089.64s)]
*  anything that we've put on the table so far, I did want to just touch on a couple of issues. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1101.88s)]
*  The first one picks up on this question of, in a sense, political culture. And much has been made, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1106.5200000000002s)]
*  and certainly was, at the Munich Security Conference with Vice President Vance's dramatic [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1112.2800000000002s)]
*  speech on, in a sense, a growing difference between political culture in the US on the one [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1117.4s)]
*  side and Europe on the other, and the question whether there was a major ideological schism there. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1121.8000000000002s)]
*  But as Rosa has just pointed out, of course, in some ways, this may be a reflection of broader [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1126.44s)]
*  divisions affecting all Western countries, including whether the definition of the West [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1131.4s)]
*  is fundamentally one about political principles or sort of a civilizational construct. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1136.0400000000002s)]
*  But more generally, I'm very interested in what you think about the staying power of American [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1141.72s)]
*  America first. A definitive aspect of post-war US global leadership, as you write in Foreign [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1147.48s)]
*  Affairs, and I've done a little writing on this as well, is the sort of cooperative, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1152.68s)]
*  relatively consensual approach to hegemony, having partners, etc. But viewed in historical perspective, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1157.48s)]
*  Trump seems like a throwback to a 1941 mindset, even a Jacksonian mindset, which makes one wonder [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1163.4s)]
*  whether or not there's any going back after he leaves. So if you have any comments on that, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1168.92s)]
*  as well as just how you interpret the current moment, I'd be very interested. Thank you. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1172.92s)]
*  Sure. Well, it is easy to despair about the amount of support among Republicans that the president [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1177.8000000000002s)]
*  and vice president's approach to a lot of these issues has. But as somebody involved in the daily [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1188.6000000000001s)]
*  argument among Republicans about this, I do not despair, actually, because I think [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1198.28s)]
*  what we are living through is a real-time test of whether these approaches actually solve people's [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1205.88s)]
*  problems. And what I noticed in the first Trump term was that when President Trump got elected [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1213.3200000000002s)]
*  in 2016, Americans broadly agreed with him that allies were not doing nearly enough for themselves, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1220.6000000000001s)]
*  that trade was exporting American jobs, and that immigrants were taking American jobs. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1229.8s)]
*  Now, granted, immigrants don't take American jobs, they create American jobs, and they fill [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1237.24s)]
*  jobs Americans don't want to do. So I'm not speaking to the legitimacy of the points, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1246.36s)]
*  but they were broadly supported by the American public in 2016. Two years later, you saw a greater [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1253.0s)]
*  than 15 percentage point drop in support for those approaches, because once they saw the policies [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1262.2s)]
*  President Trump put into place, they were unhappy with the policies. And I think we are already [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1270.28s)]
*  experiencing a similar phenomenon, which is, I mean, President Trump, other than the deployment [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1277.24s)]
*  of military forces to Los Angeles, President Trump has not utilized any authorities that were not [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1285.5600000000002s)]
*  available to President Biden to address Americans' concern about immigration. And it looks to me like [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1292.8400000000001s)]
*  President Biden might have done a lot better, Democrats might have done a lot better in 2020, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1303.48s)]
*  excuse me, in 2024, if they had exercised those authorities and addressed public concern about [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1310.8400000000001s)]
*  illegal immigration. But I also think that what you're seeing is a broad public reaction among [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1317.88s)]
*  Americans that they don't like the policy the President's putting into place. And so I think [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1325.64s)]
*  that traditional conservatism actually has better answers to these problems. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1333.24s)]
*  And we're having a real time test of what the public thinks of the President's solutions. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1339.72s)]
*  And I'm pretty confident that traditional conservative approaches are going to look [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1345.3200000000002s)]
*  really good. The more experience Americans have with President Trump's approach, not just on [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1349.96s)]
*  immigration, but on treatment of America's friends in the world. As you nicely pointed out, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1356.2s)]
*  Stuart, both you and I have long argued that American power floats on the voluntary cooperation [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1362.52s)]
*  of so many countries in the international order and cannot be sustained without that voluntary [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1371.0s)]
*  cooperation. Thank you so much, Cori. And we'll jump back to that, I know, as we get into this [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1377.56s)]
*  next topic, which is really turning to talk about NATO a bit. You know, we're obviously meeting on [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1386.28s)]
*  the heels of the Hague Summit, as well as the aftermath of last week's bombing of Iranian nuclear [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1391.32s)]
*  sites, which have short circuited EU negotiations with the Iranians. I'm not entirely sure when [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1398.28s)]
*  European allies were alerted to the fact that those strikes were going to occur. But let me turn [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1408.28s)]
*  first to Rosa, if I might, on this. You attended this summit, which, you know, in some ways, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1414.76s)]
*  it turned out to be on the surface a little bit more of a love fest than anticipated. But I think, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1420.36s)]
*  you know, that's partly because, as you said, there was a lot of genuflection in the in the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1424.6799999999998s)]
*  direction of the president and trying to have some significant damage control. So I'd like your [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1429.56s)]
*  assessment of what transpired and what it tells us about the health of NATO. There was an op-ed a [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1437.3999999999999s)]
*  few days before the summit itself by Michael Hanlon, who is also next door, but on the other [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1442.84s)]
*  side at the workings Institution and in the New York Times, where he said, look, you know, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1449.08s)]
*  NATO is doing just fine. Thank you. Given progress on the perennial burden sharing debates, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1453.8799999999999s)]
*  they've always been with us. And certainly, you know, Mark Ruta attempted to suggest optimism [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1459.1599999999999s)]
*  and that the United States is 100% committed to NATO, etc. I guess the question is, you know, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1465.48s)]
*  do you show this optimism on progress on joint priorities? And then if you have [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1471.32s)]
*  any comments on the additional comments on the on the US force against Iran and how that [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1478.84s)]
*  was received by members of the alliance, that would be great. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1486.28s)]
*  So I mean, the goal was to dodge the bullet. The goal was to keep the US engaged in NATO to avoid [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1491.6399999999999s)]
*  any question of Article 5. And before the summit, Trump had done that. So all the NATO leaders who [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1502.76s)]
*  came out of the summit, that's what they were underlining. You know, we have accomplished [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1510.84s)]
*  this and we've done so by agreeing to this 3.5% of GDP to be spent on defense and 1.5% on [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1515.3999999999999s)]
*  infrastructure. So total comes out 5% on spending on security and defense. I guess, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1524.68s)]
*  and that was it. That was the goal for the summit. So it was a very narrow goal, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1535.72s)]
*  which actually doesn't say very much about how to address the Russia threat, which is the major, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1541.0s)]
*  the main preoccupation of European leaders. And it doesn't say very much about how to spend [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1550.12s)]
*  that, that investment on defense. The only thing it does say is that this goal will be [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1559.7199999999998s)]
*  revised in 2029, which is after Donald Trump's term will be over. So I guess, if that was the [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1566.6s)]
*  goal, then I guess one can say, you know, mission accomplished. What I would be interested in [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1574.68s)]
*  seeing, and I guess this is what will be beginning now, is precisely how are European states going to [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1581.64s)]
*  coordinate so that their security and defense capabilities are actually [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1591.24s)]
*  fit for purpose with respect to the current threat landscape, which, you know, from the point of [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1596.6000000000001s)]
*  view of Europe really stems from Russia's, you know, full scale invasion of Ukraine, but also [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1602.2s)]
*  the other sort of gray zone activities and hybrid and cyber attacks in Europe, how that is going to [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1609.88s)]
*  be translated into better coordination, better defense integration in Europe, be it, you know, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1616.76s)]
*  as a sort of European pillar of NATO. There's not that much indication of that. Today, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1624.76s)]
*  EU leaders are also meeting in another summit. The summit conclusions might offer a few, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1631.96s)]
*  you know, indications of how they intend to go, both on that front and also on the Middle East. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1640.68s)]
*  But at the moment, it really is rather, I don't want to say paper fit in, but it's a bit devoid [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1647.96s)]
*  of substance at the moment. There've been a lot of discussions and debates, but actually [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1654.44s)]
*  how to go about it, I think we're still, you know, we're still left guessing a little bit. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1661.32s)]
*  The other point that I'd like to highlight, and I mean, I'm assuming that European leaders were [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1669.3999999999999s)]
*  quite content that Secretary General Rutte took on the role of, you know, appeasing Trump and [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1675.24s)]
*  therefore avoiding some embarrassing moments for other European leaders that might have felt less [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1682.4399999999998s)]
*  inclined to use certain kinds of expressions that Rutte made. But he also said, you know, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1687.96s)]
*  we're fully behind the US and, you know, bombing Iran, et cetera, et cetera. Well, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1696.44s)]
*  that is problematic, I think, for European leaders and for European publics in the sense that [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1702.28s)]
*  the European leaders always claim to be, you know, upholding international law. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1710.1200000000001s)]
*  And a lot of the rhetoric and posturing of European leaders is very much around, you know, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1715.64s)]
*  we are standing by international law, that is the grounds, those are the grounds around which [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1725.48s)]
*  Europeans have tried to persuade the rest of the world of the need to support Ukraine, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1731.96s)]
*  because Russia has broken territorial integrity of another country. And, you know, I think there's a [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1736.1200000000001s)]
*  little bit of a risk that by trying to keep the Americans in, international law gets kicked out [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1745.24s)]
*  of the window. So I think that is a bit of a risk there. And then the final point that I think needs [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1751.8799999999999s)]
*  to be raised is the question of public opinion. Clearly at this NATO summit, there have been [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1757.8799999999999s)]
*  big efforts in trying to persuade domestic audiences of the needs to make these big [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1763.72s)]
*  investments. Obviously, if you're going to move from, you know, less than 2%, because some [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1769.48s)]
*  countries, and we know that Spain decided not to endorse the 5% goal, some countries are actually [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1774.68s)]
*  spending below 2%. A plurality have reached the 2% target that was set over 10 years ago, but not [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1780.3600000000001s)]
*  all of them have got that. If you're going to move from, you know, below 2% to 5% in such a short [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1789.0s)]
*  space of time, it's going to be very hard to find the financial resources. And Sofia can speak more [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1795.08s)]
*  to this, you know, Germany has fiscal capacity, but other countries simply don't. So how do you [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1800.12s)]
*  explain this to your audiences? And what is the rationale for doing it? Is it about as [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1807.96s)]
*  the summit yesterday set, basically, it came to the conclusion that this is all about keeping America [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1816.36s)]
*  in, or is it about addressing the Russia threat? Is it about looking at the threat landscape for [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1821.4s)]
*  the next five to 10 years and what needs to be done? Is it about, you know, beefing up the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1827.8000000000002s)]
*  independent capacity of Europe to take care and take responsibility for its own challenges? And I [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1833.3200000000002s)]
*  think, again, this is something that, you know, we haven't, I wouldn't say that we've crossed the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1839.5600000000002s)]
*  Rubicon yet on this front, even though several steps have been taken. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1844.52s)]
*  Thank you. We may need a new formulation of, I guess, Lord Guismay's dictum about, you know, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1848.36s)]
*  the purposes of NATO in terms of keeping, or at least the reaffirmation of the keeping [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1855.4799999999998s)]
*  America in part. I am very struck by, in terms of international law, the degree to which [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1861.24s)]
*  many Europeans have alacrity to jump on board supporting the U.S. action in Iran while at the [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1867.8s)]
*  same time the United States is being so lukewarm at best in terms of the fate of Ukraine, where [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1874.6s)]
*  that international legal point, as you pointed out, is so much clearer. Corey, I have a couple [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1883.8s)]
*  questions here for you. Dan, just my background, it seems to me that the endurance of NATO has [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1889.3999999999999s)]
*  always been a function of both the common values and broadly shared threat perceptions, and both [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  have been important. So, you know, getting a sense from you of how these are faring would be [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1899.3999999999999s)]
*  important. You know, the preamble to the Washington Treaty invokes a common attachment to democracy, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1903.48s)]
*  the rule of law, and freedom, which I have always thought was, some people may dismiss that as [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1909.08s)]
*  window dressing, but I have always thought that it was important. And it is an embodiment and a [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1913.16s)]
*  reflection of why, or I mean, it helps explain why intra-alliance relations, even dispute resolution [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1918.76s)]
*  amongst members of the alliance, have always been handled without coercion or threats of abandonment, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1925.08s)]
*  et cetera. At the same time, obviously, a common threat perception was central to NATO's founding, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1930.28s)]
*  otherwise it would not have occurred. And that seemed to have been revived by Russia's invasion [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1935.56s)]
*  of Ukraine. So I guess I would love to know your assessment, both of the shifting sort of value [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1940.68s)]
*  foundations and the strategic foundations of NATO in the context of Trump. We heard already that [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1946.1200000000001s)]
*  with respect to Article 5, collective defense provisions, the president was quite ambiguous [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1952.92s)]
*  on route to the Hague. So I'd be interested in getting your sense on the common threat [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1958.68s)]
*  perceptions. Is there a significant, is there enough of a significance there for this, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1965.1599999999999s)]
*  to give us confidence in the future of the NATO alliance? And if you want to address the values [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1972.28s)]
*  question, too, that would be interesting. Sure. So I'll deal with the threat perception question [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1977.3999999999999s)]
*  first, that I absolutely think there's enough of a common threat perception. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1982.52s)]
*  And that common threat perception is Europeans do not feel they can protect themselves without [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1988.04s)]
*  American involvement. And that's why right now, I mean, the threat everybody's responding to is [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=1994.6s)]
*  American abandonment, because the world feels very dangerous, given the behavior of Russia, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2001.72s)]
*  given the behavior of China, given the behavior of Hungary, given the behavior of Turkey, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2007.56s)]
*  given the behavior of Israel and Iran. And what makes the NATO alliance so [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2013.24s)]
*  profound and enduring is that things change over time. But this collective of countries [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2022.36s)]
*  is [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2029.72s)]
*  commits to each other, trying through it together. NATO is genius. I mean, the threat perception [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2031.96s)]
*  hasn't always been common. And I think in recent years, the before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2039.32s)]
*  2022, countries in the south of Europe in particular, we're much more worried about [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2046.76s)]
*  immigration, about the security of the waters of the south. The northern countries were much more [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2053.48s)]
*  worried about incursions into the Arctic. I mean, NATO's genius is managing to keep all of those [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2061.32s)]
*  plates spinning on sticks at the same time. You know, the classic NATO formulation is the Harmel [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2068.6s)]
*  Report of 1967, right? Or the NATO dual track decision, we're going to deploy intermediate [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2076.68s)]
*  range nuclear weapons while we think they're a danger and we're going to negotiate an elimination [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2086.12s)]
*  of them. So they get deployed because we're actually scared about the Russian deployments. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2091.96s)]
*  And what we really want is not to have that threat to deal with. And so we come up with a magical [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2097.48s)]
*  formula of internally contradictory objectives. And that's how NATO has traditionally managed [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2103.88s)]
*  to keep all of us pulling along more or less in the same direction. You know, I keep, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2112.44s)]
*  I think it's easy to mythologize that there was a time when NATO was comfortably convergent, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2119.4s)]
*  where the United States was comfortably Atlanticist and a reliable partner. And I keep looking for [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2129.56s)]
*  that period of time and I still can't find it. But what NATO does, even in times where our values [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2136.52s)]
*  feel divergent, I mean, the Greek military coup, Turkey's slide toward authoritarianism, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2145.0s)]
*  a time when people were very concerned about the direction of democracy in Poland. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2153.4s)]
*  And now with concerns about the United States, NATO buys time for us to solve these problems. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2160.04s)]
*  And I mean, I honestly, if I had been Mark Rutte two months ago, I would have faked a heart attack [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2169.0s)]
*  to delay the NATO summit because I thought what President Trump was going to do was show up and [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2176.2799999999997s)]
*  repudiate Article 5 and announce the complete withdrawal of American troops from Europe. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2182.68s)]
*  And what NATO reminded me of in the last two months was the genius of an institution that [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2189.7999999999997s)]
*  understands that Europe does not feel at this moment it can be secure without American help. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2197.56s)]
*  So they are going to throw effort at the problem as how do we prevent Trump from doing those things? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2204.2s)]
*  A flashy number five, right? Because there's no policy input into the magic number, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2211.64s)]
*  either in the Trump administration or at NATO, but it's big enough to keep the American president [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2220.44s)]
*  looking at the glittering number. And everybody knows that a 10-year time frame is way too long [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2227.48s)]
*  to be making those kinds of plans. The world can change dramatically, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2236.36s)]
*  and Trump's not going to have any policy follow through anyway. So they bought themselves a [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2240.76s)]
*  solution to the problem. Mark Rutte ought to ask to be graded like Olympic diving, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2247.7200000000003s)]
*  right? A degree of difficulty factored into his score because to be able to pull this off, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2254.84s)]
*  given the degree of uncertainty that the Trump administration's erratic behavior is injecting [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2262.2s)]
*  into the transatlantic relationship is nothing short of brilliant in my judgment. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2269.4s)]
*  Well said, Cori. That's great. A great image. And it also just reminds me of the history. I [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2276.2799999999997s)]
*  think it's a great reminder that people often look romanticized and get overly nostalgic [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2287.0s)]
*  about golden ages. But as you point out, these debates and these tensions and moments of doubt [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2292.68s)]
*  with respect to the alliance have been there since the beginning. So thank you so much. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2299.64s)]
*  Sophia, obviously Trump's return has increased this pressure for European countries to invest more in [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2304.04s)]
*  defense capabilities. But it also, I imagine, has given some greater momentum towards [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2310.28s)]
*  the argument of enhancing capabilities for strategic autonomy and to increase freedom of [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2318.2000000000003s)]
*  maneuver vis-a-vis the United States and perhaps even some quiet hedging, depending on, or not so [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2324.1200000000003s)]
*  quiet hedging, on the future intentions of the United States. So looking at major European [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2333.8s)]
*  countries, both individually and collectively, what are the opportunities and constraints that [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2341.32s)]
*  you see for European members of the alliance moving in this direction? Yeah, really interesting [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2346.44s)]
*  question. First of all, I mean, I was nodding along with so much that Cori was saying. My heart [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2352.92s)]
*  just beats faster every time we get to talk about the Hamel report and any panel. So that might be [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2358.1200000000003s)]
*  very, very happy. Just briefly commenting on what has been said so far, I do think, I mean, NATO, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2363.16s)]
*  for the next four years, at the very least, were entering an era of low expectations. So that's [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2369.16s)]
*  the baseline for these summits. And I think in that context, the summit was a success. I mean, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2375.7999999999997s)]
*  Magritte has sacrificed a lot, including some of his public dignity, though I would say that, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2382.2s)]
*  I mean, it's been a pet peeve of mine for ages, people talking about the transatlantic relationship [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2390.92s)]
*  and these parental patriarchal terms, you know, the teenager that you need to kick out of the [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2396.2s)]
*  basement and you reap what you sow. At some point, somebody is going to call someone daddy if you keep [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2401.16s)]
*  talking about the transatlantic relationship in these terms. But so, yes, I think the five for five [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2405.8s)]
*  deal worked well. It did what it was supposed to do. We had a slightly ambiguous commitment to [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2410.6s)]
*  Article 5 from President Trump, but I think probably ambiguous enough for Vladimir Putin. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2416.44s)]
*  The 3.5 percent really matter. That's a real target. That is a serious target that is derived [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2423.0800000000004s)]
*  from NATO's regional defense plans, the Biden administration to deter and defend against [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2429.5600000000004s)]
*  Russia. The caveat here is that these plans assume a certain level of US involvement, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2435.32s)]
*  and we don't know yet where US force posture restructuring is going to land. And NATO's [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2440.28s)]
*  plans are only as valid as the force planning that they rely on. But the 3.5 percent and, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2445.0s)]
*  let's be honest, particularly the commitment of the big economic powerhouse in Germany and Europe, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2450.36s)]
*  Germany to commit to that 3.5 percent and actually giving itself the fiscal space to [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2456.28s)]
*  follow up on that commitment by 2029. That is huge news. That is going to really restructure [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2462.52s)]
*  the European rearmament effort. That is so much money that Germany is going to be the third largest [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2469.96s)]
*  global defense vendor by 2029 compared to where China and the United States and Russia are right [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2475.8s)]
*  now. So it's important that for unity's sake and symbolically and for national resilience, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2482.2s)]
*  that everybody commits to that goal. But the smaller states won't have as much of an impact [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2489.7200000000003s)]
*  as the big countries will, and that Germany has committed is a really big success. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2497.08s)]
*  I also agree with Corey that the shock, the real threat assessment is about the dependency on the [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2503.96s)]
*  United States and Europe right now. We've had two shocks. We've had the Russian invasion, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2511.32s)]
*  full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and we've had the second election of President Donald Trump, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2515.0s)]
*  and we have the 3.5 percent commitment now. So something really changed in the minds of [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2519.96s)]
*  the more transatlantically-minded leaders like Friedrich Metz or Donald Tusk, who are now [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2526.4399999999996s)]
*  speaking openly about the need for greater independence from the U.S. I don't think we're [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2531.48s)]
*  calling a strategic autonomy anymore, but we are now quietly working towards it, which to me is the [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2536.52s)]
*  preferred outcome. I've already talked about the key test, I think, is to follow the money. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2543.96s)]
*  The constraints are significant. Europe's defense architecture was never designed for self-reliance. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2548.8399999999997s)]
*  European militaries were built to slot into U.S.-led coalitions in recent decades, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2555.8s)]
*  not to operate autonomously. And the capability gaps in ISR strategic missile defense, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2561.32s)]
*  they're not operational extras. They're the backbone of modern warfare, and Europe doesn't [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2568.28s)]
*  currently have them at scale. We're working towards it. I can paint you a fairly optimistic [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2573.0800000000004s)]
*  picture about how we could get there, but this summit that we just saw was an expression of [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2578.76s)]
*  the realization that we're not currently there. I'll just make one final point, which is that a [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2583.72s)]
*  real struggle for Europeans continues to be the ambiguity in the U.S. messaging, which isn't [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2589.56s)]
*  entirely consistent. We have conservative, restrained-minded policymakers in Washington [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2596.52s)]
*  that welcome European strategic autonomy. We have other voices in the Trump administration that are [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2602.2799999999997s)]
*  openly hostile to it still, particularly when it comes to defense industrial autonomy. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2608.2s)]
*  There are some who are prepared to scale back U.S. troop commitments, some who still want to hold [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2612.92s)]
*  on to American leverage over European procurement and technology. I think right now Peter Rauher, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2617.4s)]
*  our colleague, has framed this really usefully in the sense of, is this administration able to [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2625.0s)]
*  capitalize, operationalize the sense of anxiety that it has created? And some clearer messaging, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2630.44s)]
*  I think, would be helpful. That said, it's Europe's responsibility. It's not the United States' [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2635.8s)]
*  responsibility to give us a clear message. I think partly the fact that we don't have it right now [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2640.6s)]
*  should be read by Europeans as a sign of the fact that Europe has just dropped down as an agenda [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2645.0s)]
*  item in terms of importance. There's no great strategic vision for how we want to get Europe [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2651.16s)]
*  there. And so this goes to the argument that the challenge isn't just budgetary. It's organizational. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2656.6s)]
*  It's political, right? The U.S. has long played this role of the disciplinarian, the coordinator, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2662.44s)]
*  the unifier for European defense. And with that anchor now, at least I'm certain, the real question [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2667.72s)]
*  is who leads, how are we organizing this effort? And there is no single European state that is [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2673.08s)]
*  capable of filling that vacuum, I think. And so this goes beyond the United States' strategic [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2678.68s)]
*  autonomy, requires strategy, it requires agreement on what Europe is defending and why. And we are [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  really seeing these conversations happening, bubbling beneath the surface and then sometimes [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2691.56s)]
*  getting into the headlines with debates over whether to call the EU rearmament package [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2696.52s)]
*  a rearmament package or a readiness package, with debates over how Spain and Italy don't really [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2701.96s)]
*  feel represented by the organizational principle being Ukraine's security and defending and [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2707.64s)]
*  deterring against Russia inside NATO. And terminology isn't going to resolve this. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2712.84s)]
*  Money isn't going to resolve this. But Europe needs to define a common defense interest that [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2718.04s)]
*  justifies long-term investment, risk sharing, solidarity. And I think that is the debate that [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2724.2s)]
*  can and must happen without the United States right now. Yeah, thank you so much, Sophia. It's [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2729.3199999999997s)]
*  always been interesting to me this sort of tension within U.S. positions with respect to [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2734.2799999999997s)]
*  European defense capabilities, of course, which is that, yes, please develop your capabilities and [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2741.72s)]
*  only use them under NATO. This has always been a little bit of an issue. Which, by the way, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2746.04s)]
*  we're happy to use them under NATO. NATO is the most cost-efficient, easiest way to use them. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2753.8799999999997s)]
*  The question is, where are we buying them from and can we rely on the US as we use them? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2759.0s)]
*  Gotcha. Yeah. And by the way, we have put into, along the screen, inviting people to put in [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2764.2799999999997s)]
*  questions. If they have any, those folks online, they can put them in the chat. And if we get any, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2772.04s)]
*  we will try to address a couple of them, one or two of them before we end in about [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2777.4s)]
*  15 minutes. I do want to talk to this, talk a little bit more and perhaps ask you, Corey, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2783.0s)]
*  at least for starters, about the broader implications for global order of the Trump [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2789.56s)]
*  revolution. And you've made a very strong case that the West, of course, should continue to exist, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2795.48s)]
*  in a sense, as a coherent geopolitical entity. But at the same time, if some US commitments [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2803.08s)]
*  under the America First program are becoming less obvious or less strong, and the United States [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2813.64s)]
*  does not have the same sort of global presence that it had before, I'm just wondering, do you [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2824.12s)]
*  worry about who fills that vacuum? Are you confident that it could be, for instance, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2829.64s)]
*  democratic powers that continue to uphold the order as we've known it? Do you anticipate [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2836.12s)]
*  China and others taking advantage of what could be, if not a disintegration and an erosion of [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2844.44s)]
*  West's collective capability, and not least the United States, and willingness, I should say, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2851.3199999999997s)]
*  to actually serve as a guarantor of global order? I absolutely worry about it. If the West isn't [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2856.44s)]
*  setting and enforcing international order, first of all, there will be more disorder. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2865.4s)]
*  I think that we are already seeing. We are all paying a chaos premium in the Trump administration. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2873.32s)]
*  And, you know, random tariff standards on everybody in the world simultaneously. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2880.36s)]
*  The president not only isn't playing four-dimensional chess, he's playing [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2890.6800000000003s)]
*  one-dimensional checkers, right? Like, the administration seems to think we are the only [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2895.32s)]
*  organization or country with agency. And we make a move and then dictate that it's over. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2904.12s)]
*  And that tends not to be how these things work. So the chaos premium, I think, we're all already [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2910.6s)]
*  paying. But I share your worry, Stuart, that where we are headed is that American unreliability will [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2917.88s)]
*  create so many opportunities for others to assert rules that they have the power to enforce [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2927.8s)]
*  absent collective effort by the West. And not just Europe, but the United States is not going [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2939.2400000000002s)]
*  to like those rules, right? I mean, our halfheartedness and support of Ukraine has [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2946.36s)]
*  already created the perception that countries strong enough to create a sphere of influence [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2953.08s)]
*  by destabilizing surrounding countries is going to be successful. And we are not going to like in [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2962.12s)]
*  Asia, where China assertively adopts that. We're not going to like the continent of Africa if that [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2972.44s)]
*  takes hold. So I think the Trump administration, in addition to the chaos premium, creates two [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2984.04s)]
*  additional things to worry about in terms of international order. And one is creating [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2991.7999999999997s)]
*  opportunities for other rule setters that are going to impose rules much less beneficial to the [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=2998.12s)]
*  safety and prosperity of the West. But also, I think we run the risk of the US as a rogue superpower, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3006.44s)]
*  that the sources of American dynamism domestically and the inadequacies of other powers to be able to [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3017.7200000000003s)]
*  do what the United States does well could create unilateral advantages that I think Trump already [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3027.48s)]
*  imagines, right, in how he wants to have bilateral negotiations and an end to multilateralism, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3035.8s)]
*  that you could see a United States that behaves much more like a traditional great power [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3043.8s)]
*  than how the United States has behaved since 1945. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3050.36s)]
*  Thank you, Cori. Your article has a great line that says that the United States has moved from [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3055.96s)]
*  indispensable to insufferable. I really do recommend that everybody looks at it. We do [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3062.04s)]
*  have an audience question, which I'd like to throw out. I mean, perhaps I'll ask Rosatis for starters. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3067.96s)]
*  If Europe wants to be strategically autonomous, will the USA let it, lest it lose its strategic [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3074.76s)]
*  hegemony and cultivate another potential pure rival? Is that a question that is live in Brussels? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3082.68s)]
*  I'm sorry, you're asking Brussels? Yeah, I was going to ask Rosatis, and then I'll turn to you, Cori. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3094.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the US piece, I'd be interested to hear what Cori has to say. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3101.3199999999997s)]
*  Will the US actually let that happen? And to be honest, that's what a lot of Europeans say, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3106.28s)]
*  is that the US wants us to spend more on defense, but then when we try to beef up our capabilities [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3113.2400000000002s)]
*  by investing and creating a European defense industry, then the US comes in and says, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3120.04s)]
*  no, hang on a minute, you need to buy from us. And that is a little bit one of the arguments [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3125.4s)]
*  behind the fact that Europeans haven't actually invested much on strengthening their defense [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3132.44s)]
*  capacity. And this will continue to be there. And in fact, there is, and there still are, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3139.88s)]
*  with all this fresh financing into European defense that is coming from Germany, from other [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3146.76s)]
*  countries, from the NATO targets, but also from European institutions, they're trying to facilitate [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3153.0s)]
*  that, how those resources will be experienced. There are many who are arguing, we really need to [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3159.64s)]
*  use this to build up a European defense industry. So I'd like to hear from Cori, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3167.24s)]
*  be careful what you wish for, but those Americans have been saying that Europeans need to spend [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3179.0s)]
*  more, what if Europe becomes more autonomous from the US? It's not really happening yet. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3183.24s)]
*  I'm just looking through the discussions that are taking place at this summit here in Brussels. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3189.64s)]
*  And for instance, on the Middle East, there was a report earlier this week [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3195.08s)]
*  that was discussed among the foreign ministers as to whether Europeans believe that Israel has [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3201.56s)]
*  violated human rights in Gaza and whether Europeans should take this into account and use the trade [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3208.6s)]
*  agreements with Israel to punish Israel for this. And they actually haven't made a decision, right? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3216.6s)]
*  They're postponing it to July. So it seems to me that Europeans are actually very, very [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3221.48s)]
*  cautious in making decisions that might upset the United States. So that would be my omission [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3226.12s)]
*  comment, but I think Cori perhaps can speak more from the US side. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3234.04s)]
*  So if Europe wants to be strategically autonomous, the Trump administration will say, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3239.96s)]
*  great, do it, we're out of here. And so I don't think there's any doubt about that. I think there [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3245.16s)]
*  are two reasons. There's both a narrow Trump reason and a broader American order reason that [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3255.16s)]
*  that would be the case. First, the Trump team doesn't actually believe allies strengthen [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3263.56s)]
*  American power, right? That's fundamental in how they think about it. They think [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3270.92s)]
*  America's involvement in Europe is a distraction from our real priorities. And they genuinely don't [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3276.68s)]
*  understand that you can't deploy an armored division to the Middle East without the ports [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3284.12s)]
*  of Antwerp and Hamburg. You can't save American soldiers' lives in Afghanistan without the [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3290.92s)]
*  hospital at Landstuhl in Germany. You can't get American military forces anyplace without [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3297.56s)]
*  preferential access to the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal, right? They just don't understand. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3306.44s)]
*  And if strategic autonomy progresses, the United States is going to get a very rough education [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3315.8799999999997s)]
*  about what the world looks like when allies don't give us overflight, when allies don't rely on [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3323.3999999999996s)]
*  American weapons so we have less interoperability of our own forces. The second reason I think that [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3329.48s)]
*  the US will let it is because the US actually doesn't, how are we going to force them not to, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3335.7999999999997s)]
*  right? The American order that was built by the US and its allies after 1945 is a fundamentally [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3343.8s)]
*  consensual order. When France, in objection to American nuclear strategy in 1967, withdrew [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3352.6800000000003s)]
*  from the NATO integrated military command and threw American forces out of France, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3362.28s)]
*  when a man tells you to get out of his house, you take your hat and leave. And that will be the [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3368.2799999999997s)]
*  answer this time too. Let me go probably for our final intervention from Tosofia and two quick [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3373.16s)]
*  points. One, although complicated, in her big answers, big questions. Do you believe that [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3382.6s)]
*  Trump's commitment on Article 5 will quiet European words? And I think that's a good question. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3389.96s)]
*  Will quiet European worries? And then the second one is a bit broader. As America retrenches, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3396.2s)]
*  are European countries either, are European countries looking at non-Western powers and [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3405.56s)]
*  new relationships, geopolitical relationships with non-Western powers, emerging powers, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3415.7999999999997s)]
*  probably democratic but not necessarily so, to in a sense hedge their bets in terms of building up [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3421.1600000000003s)]
*  a coalition that actually can support international order? Big questions. Very big questions. And I [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3426.36s)]
*  have about two minutes left. So first, just really briefly on will the US let it, we're not in that [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3431.6400000000003s)]
*  situation at all right now. The reason that Europeans have questions, I think, with this [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3438.36s)]
*  administration is that somebody like Secretary Rubio very actively lobbies against what is [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3442.6800000000003s)]
*  perceived in Europe as the defense industrial side of strategic autonomy, very actively lobbies [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3448.12s)]
*  for continued US participation in European arms markets and wants, frankly, Europeans to continue [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3452.6s)]
*  buying American kit, which they are happy to do because American kit is of very high quality and [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3458.12s)]
*  it's important for interoperability. But it also used to be attached to implicit security guarantees. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3464.8399999999997s)]
*  And that part of the bargain, I think, is what Europeans are questioning right now. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3470.68s)]
*  Which brings me to this sort of Article 5 commitment, and I'm using air quotes here, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3478.2s)]
*  it was a very ambiguous commitment even at this recent NATO summit. There are always two audiences [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3483.24s)]
*  here, right? There's the audience of your allies and there's the audience of your adversaries. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3490.04s)]
*  And it's much harder to reassure your allies than it is to deter your adversaries. And I think [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3495.0s)]
*  Europeans, or I at least, think that the commitment at the summit was ambiguous enough to maybe [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3500.2s)]
*  make Putin pause, but it's never going to be enough to quiet European worries. It's never been [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3507.32s)]
*  enough, neither conventional nor nuclear deterrents. There's not enough the US could say or do to [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3514.44s)]
*  quiet European worries, which is why I think that independent of whoever is the United States [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3519.6400000000003s)]
*  president, Europeans need to be able to defend themselves and work with the US when they can, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3525.0s)]
*  when it's possible, but they need to have a certain level of independence and autonomy there. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3532.28s)]
*  And then finally on the hedging question, I think the idea that there's going to be counterbalancing [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3536.6s)]
*  hedging towards China really in European countries is predicated on the notion that the extent of the [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3541.4s)]
*  European policy shift on China, seeing the country more as a rival and less as a partner, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3546.52s)]
*  was really dictated only by the United States. And I don't think that's true. I think it was [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3551.4s)]
*  certainly a shepherd and a long by the United States, but that overlooks the fact that many [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3557.3199999999997s)]
*  European countries have formed their own risk analysis of China right now. And so I don't think [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3561.88s)]
*  that all of that falls away just because the United States becomes a more complicated partner. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3567.4s)]
*  The answer of where they're going to land with China is nuanced from country to country depends [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3572.44s)]
*  on the economic ties, depends on the dependencies with China. But I don't think that it is just the [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3578.36s)]
*  Trump factor, if you will, that is going to determine that. Thank you so much. That's a very [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3583.2400000000002s)]
*  economical answer to a very big question. So thank you so much, Sophia. You mentioned [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3587.48s)]
*  two audiences, adversaries and allies. There's obviously another audience which is domestic [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3592.76s)]
*  in all of these countries. And hopefully we've contributed at least to some of the debate about [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3599.48s)]
*  how to think of these things in the broader foreign policy community. I want to thank you all, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3606.2s)]
*  Sophia, Corey, Rosa. Can we do this every day? Anyway, I really, really enjoyed it. And I always [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3611.16s)]
*  learned so much from each of you. So thank you so much until you join us next time. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3617.16s)]
*  That concludes our program. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1l4ey0Rd7I&t=3624.68s)]
