Video Description: As the U.S. navigates a new chapter in foreign policy under Trump 2.0, what role will bipartisanship play? Can Democrats and Republicans find common ground on global engagement, and how should they manage internal divisions on key issues like trade, the Middle East, and executive power? What happens to U.S. credibility abroad if foreign policy becomes increasingly polarized?

Join Senator Chris Coons and Daniel Drezner, distinguished professor of International Politics at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, for a timely discussion on the future of U.S. foreign policy, congressional oversight, and the political dynamics shaping Americaâ€™s global role. The conversation will be moderated by Kelly Sims Gallagher, a nonresident scholar in the Sustainability, Climate and Geopolitics Program at the Carnegie Endowment and dean of The Fletcher School.

# Foreign Policy Under Trump 2.0: A Conversation with Senator Chris Coons
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA)
*  Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for bearing with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  My name is Dan Baer, and it's a pleasure to welcome you here to the Carnegie Endowment [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=8.84s)]
*  for International Peace, where we're thrilled to welcome the Fletcher School this afternoon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to introduce quickly our panel, and then we'll get straight to the conversation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=16.8s)]
*  We have Kelly Sims Gallagher, who is the Dean of the Fletcher School, also a professor of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=20.64s)]
*  energy and environmental science, and a non-resident scholar here at Carnegie as well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=26.08s)]
*  The fun fact about Kelly is that her father was my elementary school principal, confirming [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  what a 13-year-old told me at a bar mitzvah a few years ago, which is the world is not [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=36.96s)]
*  that small, it's just not very well shaken up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  At the other end, we have Dan Dresner, who is, for most of us, we know him as an annoyingly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  prolific writer, who's also a professor at the Fletcher School. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=50.46s)]
*  He's a very good writer, but who seems to be able to weigh in with pithy, humorous, and insightful takes on anything happening in the world with startling speed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=56.84s)]
*  Those of you who have read him for years in the Washington Post, Foreign Policy, and other places will recognize him. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=63.84s)]
*  Senator Coons, who has been in the Senate for over a decade, which I know because I first met him when he visited Vienna during the first invasion of Ukraine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=69.84s)]
*  I hosted him and several colleagues when I was ambassador to the OSCE. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=78.84s)]
*  I saw a time, even though it was only a decade ago, saw a time when US foreign policy was actually more bipartisan, where there was bipartisan agreement. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=86.72s)]
*  In fact, when I was in Vienna, one of the friendships that I treasured most in the US government was the friendship that I had with Ben Hodges, who was at that point the commanding general of the US Army in Europe. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=93.72s)]
*  Ben and I couldn't have been more different. I was a gay guy from Colorado and Washington, DC. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=104.72s)]
*  Ben was a good old boy from Florida who was an infantry officer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=111.52s)]
*  The two of us forged a friendship based on American interests and based on a commitment to American values and to American interests in Europe. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=115.52s)]
*  That kind of friendship was much more normal then than I think it is today. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=123.52s)]
*  That will be part of the topic of today's conversation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=128.52s)]
*  Thank you all for being here and I look forward to the conversation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=130.52s)]
*  Well, thank you so much, Dan. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  Thank you all for coming. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  We're going to dive right in because I know our senator is on a tight time schedule. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=141.72s)]
*  So we're going to tackle a kind of difficult subject, which is sort of strange. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=147.12s)]
*  But we want to try to tackle the subject of bipartisanship in foreign policy, which is something that Senator Coons has been long committed to trying to explore the. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  The promise of bipartisanship and maybe the limits to it today. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=163.32s)]
*  And I'd like to just jump right in by asking Senator Coons, how do you even define bipartisanship today? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=168.32s)]
*  When we have, I think, a differentiation, I think, and we'll get into this as we talk about different topics. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=177.32s)]
*  Between President Trump himself and many in the Republican Party, specifically, I'm thinking in the Senate. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=186.72s)]
*  So thank you for a chance to be with you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=196.72s)]
*  Thank you, everybody, for being here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=198.72s)]
*  Forgive me, I'm a little amped up. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=200.72s)]
*  It's been an interesting couple of days. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=202.72s)]
*  I was just at the Munich Security Conference this past weekend and inside the room of our delegation meetings, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=204.72s)]
*  it felt like the bipartisan engagement with the world that I've known for my 15 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hadn't changed at all. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=212.12s)]
*  We had folks like Senator Risch and Senator Ernst and Senator Collins and Senator Graham on the Republican side [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=221.12s)]
*  and me and Senator Whitehouse and Schatz and Shaheen and others and in meetings with the Secretary General of NATO, with President Zelensky. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=229.12s)]
*  It felt like it was six months ago. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=237.12s)]
*  The Republicans were saying that the mistake Biden made was we weren't giving more arms earlier to Ukraine, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=239.52s)]
*  how determined we are to stand tall and keep our commitments to NATO. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=245.52s)]
*  Some of those folks are today saying that Ukraine is the victim and Russia the aggressor and that Putin's never been elected, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=249.52s)]
*  Zelensky was elected, and that it's obscene to suggest the opposite. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=261.52s)]
*  But most are not. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=266.52s)]
*  The question you're asking, Kelly, really is the division within the Republican caucus between the ascendant MAGA faction [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  that is hitching their wagon to Elon Musk and demonstrating an enthusiasm for not just testing guardrails but blowing through them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  I, in the last Congress, was the chairman of the committee that funded USAID and Lindsey Graham was a good and close partner in that work. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  And in three weeks, the Doge Bros and Elon Musk and President Trump have smashed flat the vast majority of our foreign aid infrastructure, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=294.32s)]
*  laying off thousands of people, causing enormous damage to our reputation in the world, to our ability to push back on human trafficking and extremism, hunger and disasters. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=304.32s)]
*  So there is a tension between those Republicans who still insist they care about human suffering and they care about our reputation in the world [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  and those who are increasingly enthusiastic about the madman theory, not just for Trump but for the whole country, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  and who think that a dramatic level of unpredictability somehow serves our interests, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  which is required for someone to sit in the room as Vice President Vance delivers unrecognizably incoherent remarks to a whole room full of our partners and allies from across Europe. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=340.12s)]
*  So is bipartisanship still possible? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=351.12s)]
*  Today, I introduced four bipartisan bills that relate to hostage-taking and how we treat American hostages when they come home. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=355.12s)]
*  I could explain them briefly if it's of any interest. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=363.12s)]
*  Yeah, do it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=365.12s)]
*  So this is the kind of thing that's been my stock in trade for a decade. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=367.52s)]
*  Jason Roseyan is a Washington Post reporter. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=372.52s)]
*  He spent nearly two years in an Iranian prison. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=375.52s)]
*  When he got home from Iran, what was the first thing he got from the U.S. government? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=378.52s)]
*  A tax bill. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=382.52s)]
*  Fines and fees included. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=384.52s)]
*  And he went to the IRS after overcoming some shock at both the size of the bill and the fact that he got a bill, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=386.52s)]
*  and a very dutiful IRS agent said, well, but how do we know that you were, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, by statute, you didn't file your taxes, and he's like, it's right here on the front page of the Post. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  So the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, known by the catchy phrase, spiha, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  Roger Carson is in the last administration, worked with me and Senator Rounds to get passed unanimously by the Senate, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=411.91999999999996s)]
*  says if you're on the list, you know, until recently there were 30 on the list of Americans who are wrongfully detained [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=419.32s)]
*  and you're released, you still have to pay, but you don't pay the fines and the fees and eventually you have to file. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=427.32s)]
*  Second bill for restoring your credit score. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=434.32s)]
*  Third bill for paying into Social Security, Paul Whelan, people who've spent years imprisoned overseas, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=437.32s)]
*  whether in China or Iran or Russia or elsewhere. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=443.32s)]
*  And then the last is a deterrent bill with Risch. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  Four bills for Republicans, common sense topics, fight hostage taking as a tool of diplomacy, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  should be easy to do. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  Why do I do a bill like that? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  First, it gives me something to talk to some of the most extreme Republicans about where I know they're going to agree. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not testing some, are you with or against Trump? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  Second, it's an icebreaker that shows that I'm willing to say that maybe the IRS isn't the perfect agency. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=472.12s)]
*  Third, it's something I can talk about in literally any audience and folks give it a positive reaction. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=479.12s)]
*  It's the gateway drug to getting engaged with actually legislating with me. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=485.12s)]
*  I did something very similar with Rob Portman a decade ago, a bill entitled, very catchy name, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=491.12s)]
*  Stop Taxing Death and Disability, which I gave to him a few months before his election and then said to him afterwards, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=497.52s)]
*  I've been trying to get you on this climate change bill for years and I want you to remember this moment. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=505.52s)]
*  I'm giving you a good bipartisan bill at a moment when I shouldn't be. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=512.52s)]
*  And on the other side, I'm hoping you'll work with me on a bill we ultimately got signed into law on conserving [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=517.52s)]
*  tropical rainforests and coral reefs. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=524.92s)]
*  So is it possible? Yes. Is it difficult? You bet. Has it become even more difficult now that our president is demonstrably a madman? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=527.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=534.92s)]
*  All right. Let's just step back slightly. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=536.92s)]
*  Pre-Trump administration, pre-Trump 2.0, and I'm going to bring Dan in here. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=539.92s)]
*  Can you reflect a little bit on where we've had some maybe surprising bipartisan consensus [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=545.92s)]
*  in what areas and then of course we're going to now test those under Trump 2.0? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. I mean, if you want to talk about in some ways since the United States had an internationalist foreign policy after World War II, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  the whole idea of a bipartisan foreign policy, you can argue, starts in 1947 with Arthur Vandenberg, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  who very famously said, you know, politics stops at the water's edge. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, let's be honest, that was never true and that's not true even during the golden age of this. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  But nonetheless, it was true that particularly during the Cold War, and you can argue also during what we would call the post-Cold War era, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=580.72s)]
*  let's say up until about a decade ago, frankly, there was consensus about what U.S. foreign policy was supposed to look like. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=587.72s)]
*  There was an idea that we should be, you know, engaging in trade liberalization. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=594.72s)]
*  There was an idea that we wanted to be, you know, have a relatively strong defense. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=598.72s)]
*  There were a variety of other things in terms of the promotion of human rights, the promotion of democracy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=602.72s)]
*  The idea that the United States was, you know, supposed to be, relatively speaking, a benevolent hegemon, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=609.12s)]
*  creating a global order in which everyone would do, you know, we would do good and everyone else would do well, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=614.12s)]
*  and we would therefore also do well. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=620.12s)]
*  That obviously over the last, since you can argue, the 2008 financial crisis has been slowly breaking apart. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=622.12s)]
*  The weird thing now is that when you ask if there's a bipartisan consensus on this, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=629.12s)]
*  Senator, I guess I would ask you on this. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=635.52s)]
*  There are areas where there's still a bipartisan consensus. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=638.52s)]
*  It's just that it's the doppelganger of what I just talked about. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=641.52s)]
*  There's a consensus that we should be hawkish on China and dovish on India. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=644.52s)]
*  There's a consensus that we should not be open on trade, that we want to have high trade barriers. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=648.52s)]
*  There's a consensus, apparently, that we no longer welcome immigrants into this country, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=653.52s)]
*  and we should, you know, devote a tremendous amount of resources to trying to kick those out. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=658.52s)]
*  There's a bipartisan enthusiasm for economic sanctions, that it's something that I've studied my entire career. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=664.92s)]
*  And so I guess my question becomes, is this, you know, are we seeing the areas where there might be bipartisan cooperation [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=672.92s)]
*  more in the areas of economic and political populism, which are the very things that we were presumably opposing 20, 25 years ago? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=680.92s)]
*  Well, certainly in the 2020 election, 2016 election, you've seen the emergence of economic populism on the left and the right. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=689.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm probably part of that shrinking number that still resists that being the exclusive focus of bipartisanship. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  I still think we ought to be promoting democracy around the world. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=708.3199999999999s)]
*  I still think that, as I conveyed to Secretary Rubio in a meeting we had in Munich, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=711.72s)]
*  that to completely cancel the funding for the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=717.72s)]
*  to wings of the NED that was created by President Reagan was a profoundly misguided thing for him to be doing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=723.72s)]
*  And that continuing to fight for democracy is something that actually has bipartisan support [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=731.72s)]
*  and does actually serve the interests of the American people. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=736.72s)]
*  But to your point, we've gotten sanctions happy. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=740.12s)]
*  It seems an easy tool to wield, but one that has inevitable costs. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=743.12s)]
*  There are some of us who would still like to see trade liberalization along the lines of higher standards. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=749.12s)]
*  Really not universal trade, but more trade among like-minded countries with similarly high labor and environmental standards. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=755.12s)]
*  But there's a big difference, I think, between let's tear off everybody and shut off the United States to international trade, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=764.52s)]
*  which increasingly seems to be the position of the Trump administration, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=770.52s)]
*  and wanting to continue to see some progress in terms of global integration. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=774.52s)]
*  I'm fighting for the reauthorization of AGOA, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=779.52s)]
*  which was first signed into law by Bill Clinton. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=783.52s)]
*  Jim Risch is my co-sponsor of a reauthorization bill we just introduced, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=786.52s)]
*  but it's got its opponents on both the left and right. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=790.52s)]
*  So there are strange bedfellows still, but it's across a narrower range of things and it's getting harder. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=793.92s)]
*  To what extent do you think we still have any bipartisan consensus? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=802.92s)]
*  And again, I want to acknowledge we've got differentiation in the Republican caucus now on alliances. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=807.92s)]
*  So, Roger, Senator Wicker, the Armed Services Committee Chairman, just gave Washington's farewell address. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  I think without an ounce of irony, because we just returned from Europe [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  where all the Republicans who were with me on that delegation insist that NATO Article 5 is inviolable, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  that our partnership with NATO is still the very anchor of our security and prosperity, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  and that all we're trying to do is get our allies to increase their percentage contribution. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=842.72s)]
*  If that's what the current posturing is all about, I'm great. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=847.72s)]
*  I'm afraid it's not. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=851.72s)]
*  I'm afraid there's an increasing number of folks who lean more in the advanced direction, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=853.72s)]
*  which is the hell with all of you. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=858.72s)]
*  We are America first, which means unconstrained by any sort of enduring alliances. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=860.72s)]
*  I had some very disturbing conversations with several foreign ministers [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=867.12s)]
*  about early positions the administration's taking that are wildly at variance with existing treaties. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=872.12s)]
*  And there's been a lot of focus on NATO and Ukraine in the last week. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=881.12s)]
*  Things are moving so fast. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=887.12s)]
*  But let's turn to Asia for a minute. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=889.12s)]
*  I spent a lot of time in Asia this fall, and there was a lot of concern. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=892.12s)]
*  On the part of Japanese and Korean allies about whether the United States was going to be honoring its commitments in that domain. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=896.52s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=905.52s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=907.52s)]
*  I spoke earlier today to 30 Japanese business leaders and thanked them for making the effort, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=908.52s)]
*  investing the time because they don't often as a community make what is a very long trip. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=913.52s)]
*  I was on a bipartisan delegation that included Senator Thune, Senator Haggerty, Senator Britt, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=919.52s)]
*  Senator Schmidt, Senator Peters. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=924.92s)]
*  And we went to Japan and Korea, gosh, six months ago. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=926.92s)]
*  And everyone behaved themselves. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=929.92s)]
*  Everyone talked positively about two of our major treaty allies in the region. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=932.92s)]
*  I was encouraged that one of the first things Secretary Rubio did was a quad meeting [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=936.92s)]
*  and that Prime Minister Ashida's visit with President Trump was relatively conflict free. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=941.92s)]
*  But I fully now expect that Trump will turn to Asia after Europe. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  And once he's done tearing up our relationships and security alliances in Europe, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  we'll do some real damage in Asia as well. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=960.3199999999999s)]
*  I think he thinks that we can just threaten our closest allies and partners with double digit tariffs, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=963.3199999999999s)]
*  with impunity, extract modest concessions and have it not harm our relationship. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  I think he's wrong. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  I think recent developments in South Korea make the dramatic progress that President Biden made [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=977.72s)]
*  at Camp David and afterwards with South Korea and Japan really puts that at risk. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=982.72s)]
*  And given the abrupt and unexpected announcement from Secretary Hegseth [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=988.72s)]
*  of 8 percent per year cuts to defense spending for the next five years, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=993.72s)]
*  I know the Australians have questions they'd like answered about what that means for AUKUS. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=998.72s)]
*  I think the Biden administration left a very strong legacy in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1004.12s)]
*  I think from elevating the quad to bringing together Korea and Japan to launching AUKUS [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1008.12s)]
*  to really engaging with the Pacific Island nations in the first time in years, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1013.12s)]
*  to not continue on those trajectories would be a key strategic mistake. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1018.12s)]
*  But I cannot predict where President Trump will go with these things. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1023.12s)]
*  So Dan and I were talking earlier that one of the biggest shocks has been the Putin Trump... [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1028.52s)]
*  Entente. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1037.52s)]
*  What do we say? Yeah, okay, Entente. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1039.52s)]
*  Which really turns... [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1042.52s)]
*  It's a warmer embrace than an Entente. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1044.52s)]
*  Decades of bipartisan consensus, I think, on its head. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1046.52s)]
*  So feel free to reflect on that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1051.52s)]
*  But I'm also looking ahead to another analog, which is Xi Jinping. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1054.92s)]
*  And what might happen with an approach to Xi Jinping? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1061.92s)]
*  Well, look, I don't know, but I think there is a non-zero chance that Trump has always admired Putin [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1067.92s)]
*  and always had a certain enthusiasm for him. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1074.92s)]
*  And that he may think he's pulling Putin away from China. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1077.92s)]
*  And that you'll see as a piece of the settlement of the... [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1083.3200000000002s)]
*  or the betrayal of the arrangement between Ukraine and Russia [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1086.3200000000002s)]
*  some U.S.-Russia arrangement around the Arctic that excludes the Chinese. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1091.3200000000002s)]
*  I fully expect Putin to come to the table with a menu much broader and more ambitious than Trump is prepared for [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1097.3200000000002s)]
*  or than we might obviously expect. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1104.3200000000002s)]
*  And that's one of the items I think we'll see. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1106.3200000000002s)]
*  Putin will certainly push for lightning sanctions, for giving him Ukraine, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1109.72s)]
*  or leaving Ukraine so weak in harm that he'll eventually absorb it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1113.72s)]
*  And I suspect we'll get not much in return, except the sort of faint in the direction of pulling away from China. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1117.72s)]
*  Xi Jinping is far more globally, I think, challenging to us and our model of governance and our relationships around the world. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1125.72s)]
*  And is even cagier and more capable of owning Trump in negotiations than Putin, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1135.1200000000001s)]
*  a talented KGB agent who reads Trump well. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  I'd be surprised if Trump doesn't end up selling out Taiwan, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1146.1200000000001s)]
*  despite the very strong and continuing bipartisan consensus that Taiwan, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  not just for it being a democracy, but for TSMC, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1156.1200000000001s)]
*  is critical to our security and to the stability of the Indo-Pacific. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1160.52s)]
*  I think Trump in his gut believes in great power spheres of influence [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1165.52s)]
*  and his first few weeks making these bizarre proposals to take back the Panama Canal [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1170.52s)]
*  and make Canada the 51st state and redevelop Gaza into a Riviera, you know, Mara Gaza, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1176.52s)]
*  and to seize Greenland from our... [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1183.52s)]
*  I had a meeting with the Danish foreign minister in Munich that, I mean, what do you say? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1187.92s)]
*  I mean, how do you explain? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1192.92s)]
*  And I said to him, his name's Lars, you know, Mr. Foreign Minister, could I just test a thesis, please? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1194.92s)]
*  So if someone from the Trump administration, even Donald Trump Jr., had landed in Greenland in the eponymous jet [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1201.92s)]
*  and had come and met and said, you know, we're really concerned about China and the Arctic [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1210.92s)]
*  and we'd like to expand our footprint and partner with you more closely in surveillance and security [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1215.3200000000002s)]
*  and Arctic monitoring, that was absolutely... we'd welcome it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1220.3200000000002s)]
*  And if we wanted to send the US Geologic Survey to do a more thorough assessment of your potential critical minerals [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1223.3200000000002s)]
*  and we'd like to bring some investors and explore partnering with you, absolutely. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1229.3200000000002s)]
*  And he said, yes, we would have welcomed it with open arms. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1233.3200000000002s)]
*  I said, and what's your attitude now? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1236.3200000000002s)]
*  And he said, after repeated public bullying and threatening and interceding in our internal affairs, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1238.3200000000002s)]
*  it's hard for us to be excited about this partnership. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1244.72s)]
*  I think President Trump has taken a whole series of opportunities where we could have, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1249.72s)]
*  with a more measured and responsible and balanced approach, produced an easy win. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1255.72s)]
*  And instead, he overshoots things that you have to fight everybody all the time in order to get any concession [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1260.72s)]
*  and is getting less than he might have by just approaching our close allies with a minimum of respect. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1267.72s)]
*  Do you think it's possible for Democrats to support some elements, any elements of Trump's foreign policy? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1274.72s)]
*  So in the first Trump administration, I ended up saying positive things about USMCA, which was NAFTA 2.0. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1282.72s)]
*  It basically imported some of the key chapters of TPP and because of Speaker Pelosi, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1289.72s)]
*  ended up being something Democrats could vote for because there were higher labor and environmental standards. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1295.72s)]
*  So let's just look at these two things. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1301.1200000000001s)]
*  The Abraham Accords, avoiding the imminent annexation of the West Bank in exchange for some reduction in tensions [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1304.1200000000001s)]
*  and mutual recognition between Israel and the Emirates and Sudan, but it never really mattered too much, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  and Morocco and Bahrain. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  In threatening to forcibly relocate two million Palestinians and redevelop Gaza for the golf course [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1321.1200000000001s)]
*  of his dreams at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, and threatening double-digit tariffs on both Canada and Mexico, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1329.52s)]
*  I think President Trump has taken his two signature foreign policy accomplishments of his first term [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1336.52s)]
*  and muddied them in ways that were utterly unnecessary and unconstructive. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1343.52s)]
*  So your question, is it possible? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1348.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I was perfectly happy at the time to say, these are accomplishments. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1351.52s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1355.92s)]
*  If he does things that are in our national interest, I'm willing to recognize that fact. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1356.92s)]
*  I'm just in a month so alarmed by the illegal, immoral, and consequential destruction [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1361.92s)]
*  of all of our foreign aid infrastructure that I'm looking forward with a lot more trepidation than I did last time. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1371.92s)]
*  So with that, I'm going to turn to some of the audience questions which are populating here on the iPad. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1378.92s)]
*  And one of them is about USAID. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1385.3200000000002s)]
*  So let me go straight there. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1387.3200000000002s)]
*  Is there a plan on the part of the Democrats to utilize the upcoming budget votes to negotiate a more thoughtful, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1390.3200000000002s)]
*  longer-term strategy to integrating USAID? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1397.3200000000002s)]
*  You mean the budget votes tonight? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1400.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, as we start, there are lots of budget negotiations that are going to ensue, right? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1402.3200000000002s)]
*  I suspect so. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1407.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't mean to be a prisoner of knowing how the Senate actually works. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1410.3200000000002s)]
*  I think, sorry, tonight we're going to be up all night in a ridiculous charade that's called Votorama [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1413.72s)]
*  where maybe a decade ago we actually seriously tried to negotiate substantive policy points. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1420.72s)]
*  This has turned into a shirts-and-skins exercise where Democrats propose amendments really just to force [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1427.72s)]
*  Republicans to take tough votes and vice versa. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1434.72s)]
*  And it has nothing to do with the actual substance of the ultimate outcome. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1438.1200000000001s)]
*  Republicans are engaging in an exercise that we too have done. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  This is not to be, it's a result of the Budget Act of 1974. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1448.1200000000001s)]
*  You can pass through reconciliation, it should be, once a year, by 51 votes, things that you can't otherwise do. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1452.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's how we passed the Affordable Care Act, it's how they passed the JCTA, the Job Cuts and Tax Reduction Act, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1459.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump's tax cuts of 2017. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1466.52s)]
*  So they're doing what we've done before and they're just jamming it through and we're not having any bipartisan conversations at this point. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1468.52s)]
*  The key issue is will we actually appropriate again? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1476.52s)]
*  As an appropriator, as the new ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1481.52s)]
*  which is the largest of the subcommittees, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1486.52s)]
*  there is a serious effort underway right now by Republicans to render the annual appropriations process irrelevant [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1488.92s)]
*  by passing a debt ceiling raise and funding the stuff that are, it's their top policy priorities, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1496.92s)]
*  huge increase in defense and border security so that it's done by reconciliation, we don't have to do it through regular order. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1503.92s)]
*  So it's hard to say that we're going to have constructive conversations when right now they're in the process of trying to make us irrelevant. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1511.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, look, if there were a Republican sitting here, he could quote chapter and verse other things that we've done that they disagree with. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1519.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't mean to suggest that we are the only, we are only victims here and that when we had the majority, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1526.3200000000002s)]
*  we weren't also maneuvering to do things that push the boundaries. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1531.3200000000002s)]
*  But this is pretty stunning and so it makes it hard to imagine some constructive conversation. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1535.72s)]
*  Your narrower question about AID, a bipartisan group of us spent half an hour with Rubio in person [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1541.72s)]
*  to follow on a lot of conversations we've been having to say you claim you don't want to end all humanitarian relief, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1547.72s)]
*  disaster assistance and some other key programs and you've been busily signing waivers, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1555.72s)]
*  yet they are utterly ineffective. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  You are failing to deliver on your promises to us. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1562.1200000000001s)]
*  And we had an exchange. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1566.1200000000001s)]
*  Those funds are still not making their way through. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1570.1200000000001s)]
*  He laid off all the key people at AID and terrorized what's left of the workforce [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1572.1200000000001s)]
*  and is observing in no way a federal court order trying to reverse the hiring freeze. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1578.1200000000001s)]
*  So we had a back and forth, but let's just say that so far it's had no meaningful impact on restoring funding [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1584.52s)]
*  and a whole range of household name global NGOs that are US headquartered have laid off thousands of staff [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1593.52s)]
*  and programs in a hundred countries are either closed or on the verge of closing. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1601.52s)]
*  Okay, let's switch to arms control. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1609.52s)]
*  Aren't you glad you invited me? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1612.92s)]
*  President Trump called for arms control discussions with both China and Russia last week. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1615.92s)]
*  Do you think this could be an area for constructive bipartisan foreign policy? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1622.92s)]
*  Look, arms reduction, I think we both need, it's less likely, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1631.92s)]
*  we need the equivalent of an arms control agreement for the use of artificial intelligence with China. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1638.3200000000002s)]
*  China and the US are the world's principle fastest moving leaders in AI [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1643.3200000000002s)]
*  and in particular the application of AI to conflict and to weapon systems. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1649.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think if there is a genuine risk for dramatic global harm, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1653.3200000000002s)]
*  AI is one of our biggest threats. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1660.3200000000002s)]
*  Obviously nuclear weapons is one of our longest existing threats. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1662.3200000000002s)]
*  And to bring China into the conversation now that they are dramatically expanding and modernizing their nuclear force [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1666.72s)]
*  would be very constructive if we could get it done. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1672.72s)]
*  The Chinese have persistently refused to engage in any sort of strategic arms control negotiation with us. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1675.72s)]
*  And I think their view is that they want to first become at nuclear strategic parity with us [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1681.72s)]
*  and then maybe, maybe, if they haven't pushed us aside, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1687.72s)]
*  at that point we might engage in some strategic conversation. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1694.1200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, it could be a bipartisan area of engagement. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1698.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's turn to countering disinformation and foreign influence. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1702.1200000000001s)]
*  Are we still doing that? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1708.1200000000001s)]
*  Dan, take it over. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1712.1200000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1714.1200000000001s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1715.1200000000001s)]
*  No, I would just go on a rant for ten minutes. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1717.1200000000001s)]
*  I actually have a slightly different question. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  I just did that. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1721.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to take advantage of being on the podium to ask you this. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1723.52s)]
*  Which is we've been talking about bipartisanship. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1725.52s)]
*  Let's talk about partisanship for a second. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1727.52s)]
*  You might recall that in 2015 when the JCPOA was being negotiated, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1729.52s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton organized a letter that he sent to the Iranian government saying [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1735.52s)]
*  you can sign this but we're not necessarily, you know, there could be a Republican takeover, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1741.52s)]
*  we're not necessarily going to do that. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1745.52s)]
*  Now this was widely condemned by Democrats at the time as being reckless and so on and so forth. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1747.52s)]
*  But given that you are now in the minority, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1752.92s)]
*  I guess the question I have to ask is can you conceive of a situation where the Democrats [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1754.92s)]
*  would do some version of that if the U.S. signs an agreement with Russia [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1757.92s)]
*  or if there's some sort of grand bargain, you know, which seems like a bad deal with Xi, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1761.92s)]
*  something along those lines. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1765.92s)]
*  So I really can't posit an exact parallel, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1767.92s)]
*  meaning a group of Democrats writing someone who is demonstrably an enemy of the United States [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1771.92s)]
*  and saying, hey, by the way, listen to us. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1777.92s)]
*  But saying this may be an agreement reached by the President of the United States, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1782.3200000000002s)]
*  but we profoundly disagree. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1786.3200000000002s)]
*  We disagree with the facts, we disagree with the direction, we disagree with the impact. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1788.3200000000002s)]
*  I'd say that's actually quite possible, particularly in this circumstance. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1793.3200000000002s)]
*  If President Zelensky in Ukraine are coerced into a profoundly unfair deal [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1798.3200000000002s)]
*  that is the equivalent of an abdication of our respect and partnership [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  with their brave fight for their own freedom and sovereignty, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1809.72s)]
*  that's quite possible. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1812.72s)]
*  I think that is positioned differently than Senator Cotton's action was, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1814.72s)]
*  but look to the larger point about are we still fighting disinformation. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1819.72s)]
*  I had a memorable meeting with the Romanian Foreign Minister. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1825.72s)]
*  As you may have noted, the Vice President in his remarks in Munich [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1829.72s)]
*  specifically brought up the Romanian election twice [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1833.72s)]
*  as an example of how Europe has abandoned our common values [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1837.1200000000001s)]
*  and our commitment to free speech and free and fair elections. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1841.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm certain I'm in one of the few rooms where folks might actually be tracking this, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1844.1200000000001s)]
*  unlike in the Senate. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  I went to Moldova and Romania between Christmas and New Year's [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  because I thought it was urgent that someone from the Senate [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1856.1200000000001s)]
*  come and meet with President Moldova [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  and talk about the consequences and impact of Russia turning off the gas to Transnistria [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1863.52s)]
*  and thus the rest of Moldova as a coercive measure [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1868.52s)]
*  and to meet with the President, Prime Minister, and our intelligence station [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1872.52s)]
*  and Romanian intelligence and the Constitutional Court members [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1877.52s)]
*  to talk about their decision to essentially overturn an election [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1880.52s)]
*  based on their assessment that there had been, through TikTok, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1885.52s)]
*  a dramatic level of Russian interference in their free and fair elections [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1889.92s)]
*  and a violation of Romanian election law. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1893.92s)]
*  I see this almost exactly opposite of how apparently the Vice President does [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1896.92s)]
*  rather than a violation of our core values. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1900.92s)]
*  Willfully allowing foreign manipulation of one's own election [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1903.92s)]
*  in violation of a nation's election laws through social media [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1908.92s)]
*  strikes me as reckless, were the Romanians to have just ignored that [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1913.92s)]
*  and enshrined the results of an improper election? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1919.3200000000002s)]
*  Isn't that one of the problems though? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1923.3200000000002s)]
*  The fact that, as you say, this is a room where people would care about Moldova and Romania. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1925.3200000000002s)]
*  Isn't one of the problems in terms of talking about bipartisanship in foreign policy [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1930.3200000000002s)]
*  is that fundamentally the American people don't care. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1934.3200000000002s)]
*  It's not that they're hostile to Ukraine or Taiwan or what have you. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1937.3200000000002s)]
*  They are fundamentally uninterested in foreign policy, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  which is a depressing thing for a professor of international politics to say, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1945.72s)]
*  but nonetheless is the state of public opinion right now. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1948.72s)]
*  Yet this room is full. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1951.72s)]
*  I'll say this. Americans have a remarkable network of connections to the rest of the world. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1954.72s)]
*  We are a nation largely made up of immigrants who came here through a wide variety of means [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1960.72s)]
*  at different times and in different ways. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1965.72s)]
*  But the number of Delawareans, the number of people in my region [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1968.72s)]
*  who come to me to urgently talk about China and Turkey, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1974.1200000000001s)]
*  India and Pakistan, Rwanda and DRC, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1977.1200000000001s)]
*  Moldova and Romania, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1980.1200000000001s)]
*  Taiwan versus PRC. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1984.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, all of these nations have diaspora communities in my immediate region. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's factions of Cameroonians in Delaware. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1990.1200000000001s)]
*  And it is delightful to be routinely reminded that while average Americans don't care, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=1995.1200000000001s)]
*  hundreds of millions of Americans care. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2002.52s)]
*  And so to some extent, I think simply raising their voice and being more vocally and viscerally [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2004.52s)]
*  owning a rightful place in American politics in terms of how we engage with the world [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2011.52s)]
*  is something I try to encourage diaspora communities to do. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2016.52s)]
*  Many of these folks are first generation Americans. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2019.52s)]
*  And so somehow, oddly, feel less like it's okay for them to... [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2022.52s)]
*  You feel like it's impolite for them to do. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2026.52s)]
*  And I keep saying, keep talking because [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2027.52s)]
*  I'm convinced our safety and security and prosperity is rooted in being a nation that is welcoming [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2030.92s)]
*  and celebrates immigrants, that remains connected to the rest of the world [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2037.92s)]
*  in an open-handed, balanced way that respects our differences in values and systems and histories, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2042.92s)]
*  but invests in mutually beneficial development. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2049.92s)]
*  And I do think Americans care about whether children are starving, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2053.92s)]
*  about whether disease is spreading, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2059.32s)]
*  about whether human traffickers are taking advantage of desperate people, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2061.32s)]
*  about whether famine causes migration. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2065.32s)]
*  They may not know what USAID does, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2068.32s)]
*  but they care about the people and their lives, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2071.32s)]
*  and they care even more about it not negatively impacting us and our lives. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2074.32s)]
*  But you're right, it is a tough argument to make. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2079.32s)]
*  And there are very few presidential elections that turn on foreign policy issues, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2081.32s)]
*  but there are hundreds of millions of Americans who know [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2085.7200000000003s)]
*  that if we don't engage with the world and pay attention to the world, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  that in the end, problems that are today overseas will inevitably become our problems. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, I want to try to get a couple more questions in. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2096.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, you're getting applause, applause. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2099.7200000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2102.7200000000003s)]
*  You led the Bipartisan Build Act [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  that created the Development Finance Corporation during the first Trump term. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2107.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you see other opportunities like that to supplement sanctions and tariffs [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2112.12s)]
*  with additional positive economic tools? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2117.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2122.12s)]
*  Senator Young and I just introduced a bipartisan bill together [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2123.12s)]
*  about critical mineral processing and the Defense Production Act [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2126.12s)]
*  and ways that we might be able to accelerate investment [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2131.12s)]
*  in critical mineral processing. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2134.12s)]
*  I will say this, forgive the self-indulgence. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2137.12s)]
*  The last conversation I had with Secretary Clinton before the election [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2140.52s)]
*  was about the DFC and the Build Act. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2145.52s)]
*  And I said, Madam Secretary, I've got this great bill I've been working on [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2147.52s)]
*  with Bob Corker and it's ready to go. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2150.52s)]
*  And she asked a few pointed questions and I explained it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2152.52s)]
*  She said, oh, that's great. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2154.52s)]
*  And I said, this will be your first bill, signed into law as president. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2156.52s)]
*  She was not elected, you might not know that. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2159.52s)]
*  And what was interesting about that experience was that Bob and I, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2162.52s)]
*  Senator Corker, chairman of Foreign Relations, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2166.52s)]
*  in the next term, we sort of dropped back 30 yards [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2169.92s)]
*  and took this bill that made sense for a Democrat to sign [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2173.92s)]
*  and helped it make sense for Trump to sign. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2176.92s)]
*  Ted Yoho of Jacksonville, Florida, a Freedom Caucus member, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2179.92s)]
*  became one of its biggest champions in the House, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2184.92s)]
*  is still very positive about the DFC today, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2186.92s)]
*  and I've tried to do a number of bills like this. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2189.92s)]
*  It works for me or for a Democratic perspective [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2192.92s)]
*  because the DFC is about development and investing [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2196.32s)]
*  and bringing economic opportunity to underdeveloped countries [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2199.32s)]
*  on their terms. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2203.32s)]
*  Ted loved it because it was, in his view, replacing grants [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2205.32s)]
*  from U.S. taxpayer money with investment by our private sector. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2208.32s)]
*  It works both ways. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2212.32s)]
*  I do think that the DFC is going to be under enormous pressure. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2214.32s)]
*  Jim Risch and Jean Chihin and I have been talking about its reauthorization. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2217.32s)]
*  I think there's a real chance that Trump, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2222.32s)]
*  that President Trump's repeated talking about a MAGA sovereign wealth fund. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2225.7200000000003s)]
*  What he's really thinking is he's going to put [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2229.7200000000003s)]
*  billions of dollars that they've taken from USAID [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  and reallocate them to the DFC, get rid of the D, the development side, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2237.7200000000003s)]
*  and do the FC and make it more of a MAGA sovereign wealth fund. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2242.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm very concerned about that potential trajectory. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2246.7200000000003s)]
*  I do think that our ability, in a balanced way, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2249.7200000000003s)]
*  to do development finance in partnership with our allies [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2254.12s)]
*  is an admirable goal we should still pursue. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2258.12s)]
*  In fact, one of the folks I was talking to today is from JBIC, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2261.12s)]
*  the Japanese equivalent. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2264.12s)]
*  I don't regret getting the Build Act signed into law by President Trump [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2266.12s)]
*  or working with Adam Bowler, who was really the first full administrator. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2270.12s)]
*  Ray Washburn helped with the transition. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2275.12s)]
*  But I'm very worried about where it might go [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2278.12s)]
*  and what might become of it. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2281.52s)]
*  What red lines do you anticipate Republicans may have [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2284.52s)]
*  in measuring when or if to speak out against the Trump administration? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2288.52s)]
*  Look, if betraying Ukraine isn't a red line, I don't know what is. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2293.52s)]
*  If a 40% cut to defense spending isn't a red line for them, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2296.52s)]
*  I don't know what is. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2300.52s)]
*  Several of my colleagues with whom I spoke today [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2302.52s)]
*  are making noises as if they will act. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2306.52s)]
*  I will tell you, someone I became close friends with, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2310.92s)]
*  I'm still close friends with, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2314.92s)]
*  Jeff Flake, former Senator from Arizona, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2316.92s)]
*  is one of the most conservative adult humans I've ever met. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2318.92s)]
*  I mean, look at the record. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2321.92s)]
*  At the end of the first Congress where Jeff and I served together, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2324.92s)]
*  we get a CQ score for who we vote the most with [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2328.92s)]
*  and who we vote the least with. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2331.92s)]
*  And who I voted the least with was Jeff Sessions. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2333.92s)]
*  And number two was Jeff Flake. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2336.92s)]
*  And the two of us literally we met up on the floor and we were like, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2340.32s)]
*  hey, I really like you, man. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2343.32s)]
*  And James Langford is that guy in this Congress. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2345.32s)]
*  We literally walk onto the floor about the same time every Monday [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2350.32s)]
*  and go like this or like this. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2353.32s)]
*  And then we pull off to the side and talk about our families [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2355.32s)]
*  and weekend and how are you making it through and what do you think. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2357.32s)]
*  But Jeff Flake, the first time Trump came to their caucus, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2361.32s)]
*  really stood up to him and said, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2366.32s)]
*  what you're talking about is not conservatism [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2368.7200000000003s)]
*  and it's not principled Republican goldwater conservatism. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2370.7200000000003s)]
*  It's populism and you're abandoning some of our core positions. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2373.7200000000003s)]
*  And Trump really took a disliking to him immediately and went after him. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2376.7200000000003s)]
*  And ultimately, instead of doing the things that other colleagues of his did [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2380.7200000000003s)]
*  in order to overcome opposition, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2385.7200000000003s)]
*  Jeff stuck firm to his principles and was driven out of Congress as a result. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2388.7200000000003s)]
*  He later endorsed Joe Biden and has now served as ambassador to Turkey, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2394.12s)]
*  but half his family won't speak to him again. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2399.12s)]
*  And it's important to remember that for folks who are enraged [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2402.12s)]
*  about things like the potential betrayal of Ukraine, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2407.12s)]
*  it is costly, personally, professionally, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2410.12s)]
*  in terms of their social context, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2414.12s)]
*  to stand up and test one's own caucus. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2417.12s)]
*  John McCain was a dear friend and someone I admired. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2422.52s)]
*  And his refusal to go along with repealing the Affordable Care Act [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2425.52s)]
*  without anything to replace it was very costly. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2430.52s)]
*  But he was a man of principle who saw clearly moments [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2433.52s)]
*  to stand up and stand separately. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2437.52s)]
*  And I'm hoping that there's a few who will find [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2440.52s)]
*  they've just hit their red line [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2444.52s)]
*  with the very, very imminent potential betrayal of Ukraine. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2447.52s)]
*  So I promise to get you out on time. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2452.52s)]
*  Oh, Siri is going off. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2455.52s)]
*  Artificial intelligence, our greatest challenge. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2458.52s)]
*  This is Gary. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2461.52s)]
*  I don't know how to turn this off. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2464.52s)]
*  I'm the dean of the Fletcher School, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2467.52s)]
*  which is a school of global affairs. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2470.52s)]
*  I know we have a number of our students in the audience here. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2473.52s)]
*  You and I first met each other about 30 years ago, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2476.52s)]
*  when I was named as a Truman Scholar, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2479.52s)]
*  and you were a mentor to our Truman class. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2483.52s)]
*  And so I know you and I share a deep commitment to public service. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2486.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of our current students are asking themselves right now, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2490.52s)]
*  where is my future in public service? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2495.52s)]
*  What do you have to say to them? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2499.52s)]
*  So I became a Democrat in 1984. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2501.52s)]
*  I'm from a Republican family. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2506.52s)]
*  In fact, my grandmother was so angry at me for registering as a Democrat, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2509.52s)]
*  she disowned me, which meant we fought every week for the rest of our lives. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2514.52s)]
*  I mean, my family is really serious about politics. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2519.52s)]
*  My grandparents were very active anti-communists [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2523.52s)]
*  and very proud Republicans. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2528.52s)]
*  And my party, the Democratic Party, lost the 1980 election, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2532.52s)]
*  lost the 1984 election, lost the 1988 election. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2537.52s)]
*  Every candidate I worked for, 84, 86, 88, 90, they all lost. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2540.52s)]
*  It was a really hard period. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2547.52s)]
*  And so when I was newly interested in politics, it was a tough slog. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2549.52s)]
*  And this is a partisan answer for which I will apologize, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2555.52s)]
*  because there have got to be people here who are broader than just Democratic Party views. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2558.52s)]
*  I've been saying to my team, in 1980, Democrats failed to defeat Ronald Reagan [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2562.52s)]
*  and failed to read the moment and the movement of the country [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2569.52s)]
*  and kept getting it wrong until Bill Clinton, ultimately, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2572.52s)]
*  many years later pulled the party in a different direction. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2576.52s)]
*  But in 2004, my party got shellacked by George W. Bush, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2579.52s)]
*  and two years later we took back the Senate by a lot. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2585.52s)]
*  And four years later we elect Barack Obama and had both chambers of Congress. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2589.52s)]
*  So it's up to you, if you care about electoral politics, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2594.52s)]
*  to decide whether it's 1980 or it's 2004, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2598.52s)]
*  whether you're going to throw yourself wholeheartedly into the elections this year [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2602.52s)]
*  in states across the country, but principally Virginia and New Jersey, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2607.52s)]
*  whether you're going to work on one of the plucky House races [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2610.52s)]
*  that are going to change the map and change history, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2614.52s)]
*  whether you're going to find one of the folks who deserves a shot at being president, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2617.52s)]
*  but none of us have heard of right now. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2621.52s)]
*  I mean, if I told you in 2004 that this guy with big ears and a funny name from Illinois [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2623.52s)]
*  was going to be the next president of the United States, you would have laughed me out of the room. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2628.52s)]
*  There are people today in my caucus or serving in local government [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2631.52s)]
*  or in nonprofits or who have never thought for a minute about running for office, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2635.52s)]
*  who can and should represent the people of the United States. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2639.52s)]
*  In 2017, four women from Pennsylvania who had never run for office, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2643.52s)]
*  some of you may know them, we call them the Fab Four, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2649.52s)]
*  but Chrissy Hullahan is the one closest to my district. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2653.52s)]
*  If I had to go into a lab and design the perfect candidate, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2657.52s)]
*  I would have come up with Chrissy Hullahan, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2661.52s)]
*  someone who never gave a second's thought to electoral politics, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2663.52s)]
*  but because of her education, her training, her background, her values, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2666.52s)]
*  knocked off a Republican seat that had been held by Republicans for decades. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2669.52s)]
*  What am I saying? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2673.52s)]
*  A, this is alarming, disconcerting, scary, unsettling. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2675.52s)]
*  If you want a better nation, pitch in. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2680.52s)]
*  Do something local. Do something that feeds your soul. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2683.52s)]
*  Do something that reconnects. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2687.52s)]
*  Get out of Washington. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2689.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, seriously. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2691.52s)]
*  Come to Fletcher. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2693.52s)]
*  The job prospects are not that great here anyway. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2695.52s)]
*  I found my way into public service not by, I mean, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2699.52s)]
*  I gave up after those crushing electoral defeats, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2703.52s)]
*  and I worked for the I Have a Dream Foundation, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2706.52s)]
*  and I worked for the Coalition for the Homeless, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2708.52s)]
*  and I went and lived and worked in South Africa. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2710.52s)]
*  I just sort of threw up my hands and said, politics, ha! [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2712.52s)]
*  And I spent a decade outside of electoral politics [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2717.52s)]
*  and found purpose and found a calling. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2721.52s)]
*  So whether it is working in an animal shelter [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2724.52s)]
*  or helping restore the environment, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2727.52s)]
*  working in local government, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2729.52s)]
*  which is where most of the action really is anyway, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2731.52s)]
*  or figuring out what you're terrible at and what you don't want to do, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2734.52s)]
*  which is constructive, tell me. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2737.52s)]
*  You can quote me to your parents. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2739.52s)]
*  Do three jobs that you're bad at and you don't like, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2741.52s)]
*  and you might find the fourth one that you're really, really great at. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2743.52s)]
*  If you'd told me when I was 23, 24, 25, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2749.52s)]
*  that I would spend a decade in county government [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2752.52s)]
*  and love it and really learn a lot through it, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2755.52s)]
*  I would have laughed in your face. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2758.52s)]
*  Fixing sewers? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2760.52s)]
*  Improving police response time? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2762.52s)]
*  Caring about the libraries? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2764.52s)]
*  How, right? I mean, it's like Parks and Rec. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2766.52s)]
*  I mean, like, literally, my wife is Amy Poehler from Parks and Rec. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2769.52s)]
*  She worked in county government for a decade, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2772.52s)]
*  and our kids, the first time they saw the show, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2775.52s)]
*  they were like, Mom, that's you! [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2777.52s)]
*  My wife helped me understand that it wasn't as, you know, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2779.52s)]
*  as the anti-apartheid fight of South Africa, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2784.52s)]
*  but it was helping my community build better neighborhoods, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2787.52s)]
*  improve youth services, bring, you know, farmers... [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2791.52s)]
*  I was a big farmers market guy, right, just before it was cool. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2796.52s)]
*  I worked on a lot of things that actually touched the lives of people [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2800.52s)]
*  I grew up with and I knew in neighborhoods I was from, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2804.52s)]
*  and it wasn't as sexy as working in Washington on Capitol Hill, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2807.52s)]
*  but my God, it made a difference, and they were fights that mattered. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2811.52s)]
*  There are millions of people who today are doubting [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2815.52s)]
*  the decency, kindness, and goodness and reliability of the American people. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2818.52s)]
*  Prove them wrong. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2823.52s)]
*  Show us we have a heart. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2824.52s)]
*  Demonstrate that we mean what we say. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2826.52s)]
*  Fight for democracy at every level and earn our way back [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2828.52s)]
*  into the good graces of the world that for a long time [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2833.52s)]
*  saw us as the indispensable nation. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2838.52s)]
*  The most uplifting thing I did in Munich was I was on a panel [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2840.52s)]
*  that Anne Applebaum facilitated with three members of parliament [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2845.52s)]
*  from Ghana, from Burma, and from Poland. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2848.52s)]
*  In Burma, a government in exile because there's been a military coup. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2852.52s)]
*  All three were young women. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2856.52s)]
*  All three were fierce, capable, and passionate about democracy [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2858.52s)]
*  and the future of their nations. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2863.52s)]
*  And I listened more than I talked uncharacteristically [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2865.52s)]
*  and thanked all three of them and said I really needed this today [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2869.52s)]
*  because it reminds me that democracy is not the unique province [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2873.52s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2877.52s)]
*  The idea that you should have a say in who governs your community [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2878.52s)]
*  and your decisions, the idea that you should be able to read things [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2883.52s)]
*  that aren't controlled by the government full of lies, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2886.52s)]
*  the idea that if you have a dispute with someone, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2889.52s)]
*  you should be able to go to a court and it's not prejudged [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2891.52s)]
*  who's going to win based on who paid a bribe or who's related to whom. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2894.52s)]
*  The idea that your ethnicity, your language, your faith, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2897.52s)]
*  your background shouldn't predetermine the outcome of your life [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvgFOmdp7cA&t=2900.52s)]
