Video Description: Does public opinion matter in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Do leaders pay attention to the changing views of their respective constituencies? Each situation presents unique challenges for analysts and scholars trying to answer these questions. And those challenges have grown exponentially more complicated in the wake of October 7, 2023, and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.  

How have Israeli and Palestinian attitudes evolved toward their leaders and the region, one another, the United States’ role, and the war?  And how do Israelis and Palestinians on all sides of the divide  imagine their  future, particularly whether there’s a pathway out of the ongoing crisis and any prospects for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?   

Join Aaron David Miller as he engages in conversation with Dahlia Scheindlin, a political strategist and a public opinion researcher, and Khalil Shikaki, the director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, two analysts and pollsters of Israeli and Palestinian politics and public opinion, on these and other issues on the next Carnegie Connects.

# Does Israeli and Palestinian Public Opinion Really Matter?
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ)
*  Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you are in this world of ours, I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  truly hope you're safe and healthy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=14.36s)]
*  I'm Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=17.56s)]
*  and welcome to Carnegie Connects, a series of conversations on issues of critical importance [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=20.94s)]
*  to America and to the world. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=26.7s)]
*  Today I'm really pleased to welcome to the program Dalia Shinlin and Khalil Shkaki, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=29.68s)]
*  two friends, two extraordinary interpreters, analysts of public opinion of Israeli and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=35.76s)]
*  Palestinian politics. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=42.6s)]
*  And the fact that they're here together, frankly, was a not so hidden agenda on my part. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=44.84s)]
*  I mean, so much hopelessness pervades prospects or any normal relationships between Israelis [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  and Palestinians, let alone a conflict ending agreement to solve the problem of what I've [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=57.8s)]
*  called the much too promised land. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  But it's really important to know and to see that there are Israelis and Palestinians who [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=66.34s)]
*  can appear together and who have enormous amount of respect for one another. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=73.56s)]
*  So Dalia and Khalil, I want to thank you so much for coming. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=79.9s)]
*  I'll briefly introduce them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=85.68s)]
*  Dalia Shinlin is a political strategist and a public opinion researcher who has advised [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=87.84s)]
*  nine Israeli national campaigns, worked on elections, referendums and public affairs [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=92.84s)]
*  in 15 other countries over the last quarter century. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  She's currently a regular columnist for AARP. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=103.12s)]
*  She shared her expertise drawn from experiences in the Balkans and Eastern Europe on elections. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=107.0s)]
*  She's also the author of the crooked timber of democracy in Israel, Promise Unfulfilled. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=113.56s)]
*  Khalil Shikaki, who I've known longer than Dalia, and Khalil, I'm reminded of that session, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  must have been in the 80s. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Whoa, in the 80s. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  In Ramallah, you hosted for me with a discussion of, it was fascinating, fascinating experience. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=129.44s)]
*  I want to thank you for that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=137.8s)]
*  Khalil is a professor of political science and director of the Palestinian Center for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=140.08s)]
*  Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah and a member of the student committer of the Arab [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=147.4s)]
*  Barometer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=152.52s)]
*  He's also a senior fellow at the Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis University. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=153.52s)]
*  We have a great deal to cover. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to divide this convo into three parts, the past, the present and the future. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  Before we get into the past, I'd just like to ask each of you a question about your craft, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=167.12s)]
*  craft, art, science of tracking, researching, triangulating public opinion. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=173.56s)]
*  What is the greatest challenge that each of you face, number one? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=181.66s)]
*  And number two, if you were to critique your own work and your own analysis, what's its [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  greatest vulnerability? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=192.32s)]
*  Dalia, can I start with you? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=193.32s)]
*  You can. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, first of all, for hosting me again. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  It's always nice to talk with you and to be here with Khalil. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  I think the challenges are manifold, of course, but one of the biggest challenges is trying [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  to explain human behavior through quantified, closed questions. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=210.12s)]
*  Human behavior and thinking are complex and I think there's a tendency to assume that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=214.8s)]
*  people are being irrational when they have contradictory attitudes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  We have to try to get at attitudes of people who are going through overwhelming and often [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=224.12s)]
*  unprecedented experiences and situations and try to capture that in very simple questions [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  that people can both understand easily from reading them or answering them through an [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=235.88s)]
*  interview but also capture very in-depth dynamics. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=241.12s)]
*  We are often confronted with an overwhelming amount of data. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  Then we have to try to piece it together and tell a coherent story without papering over [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=247.96s)]
*  the paradoxes or contradictions of how people think, which by the way, I do not believe [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=254.88s)]
*  is based on irrational thinking. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  I think it's a natural human reaction to the complexities of the world. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  I think in terms of critique, I've thought a lot about this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=263.96s)]
*  I hope it's not bad form to say I'm not really going to critique my own analysis, I'm going [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=269.56s)]
*  to critique other people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=273.2s)]
*  For example, how consumers read polls, I think, has become problematic. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=275.12s)]
*  I think there is a tendency of people who consume polling to think that it answers all [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=280.04s)]
*  questions and particularly to look at polling as if it predicts the future, which is a big [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=284.76s)]
*  mistake and a discredit to the field because I think polling truly excels at analyzing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  the past and the present, which can help us point out possible scenarios for the future [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  and it can be an incredible tool. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=302.04s)]
*  So assuming that polls are there to predict the future undersells what polls can do and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=304.76s)]
*  overstates what they can't do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=310.56s)]
*  And I think that's a shame. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=312.04s)]
*  I also would say pollsters in general need to be always more transparent about their [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=313.16s)]
*  methodology. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=316.92s)]
*  There's a tendency to just throw around data as if methodology and quality of the survey [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=317.92s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=323.0s)]
*  And so that's something I aspire to do, of course. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=324.0s)]
*  And in terms of critiquing my own analysis of polls, it's hard to pinpoint one thing, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  but there should always be a self-questioning of what you think you see in the numbers to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=335.56s)]
*  make sure that you're not just imposing your own analysis that you've had for years when [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  the findings are pretty consistent and then they change. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  There can be a tendency to assume, to read the data through the filter of what you already [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=348.2s)]
*  thought and you have to always be aware that people really can change over time and you [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=352.56s)]
*  can impose your expectations on the data that you're getting and especially when you're [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=357.76s)]
*  writing the questions. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=361.76s)]
*  Very well said. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=364.76s)]
*  It gets to the issue of the basic reality about life, which is you cannot see for good [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=367.76s)]
*  or ill what is in front of you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=374.4s)]
*  That's hopeful and perhaps we can talk about that later. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=377.28s)]
*  Khalil, on to you now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=380.76s)]
*  What is the biggest challenge and biggest critique of your work? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  I think the biggest challenge, of course, is how do you know when you are operating [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  in a non-democratic environment, how do you make sure that people are free to express [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  their views and that they are willing to trust you with those news? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  The difficult challenge that we have faced from day one, we had Israeli occupation, we [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=410.36s)]
*  had a Palestinian authority, Gaza under Hamas. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=417.36s)]
*  Today, it's extremely difficult. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=420.36s)]
*  As the political system becomes more and more authoritarian, it becomes very difficult for [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=423.36s)]
*  us to trust the responses we obtain. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=430.36s)]
*  How do you overcome the fear factor? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=435.56s)]
*  It has been the most important issue. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=437.56s)]
*  One way in which we've addressed that is to recognize its existence and to try and measure [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=441.56s)]
*  it, find ways in which we are able to tell the extent to which there is fear in the answers [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=447.56s)]
*  and whether we are over time able to overcome that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=454.56s)]
*  I think to some extent, we've been successful. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=458.56s)]
*  Not 100%, there is absolutely no doubt that this has been the biggest challenge. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=463.76s)]
*  There are technical other challenges. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=468.76s)]
*  Sampling is not easy, particularly during the war in Gaza. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=471.76s)]
*  This has been an extremely difficult challenge and extremely costly to be able to collect [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=475.76s)]
*  data, to have a database where people are and where they are moving. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=481.76s)]
*  There is a third challenge that we face. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=486.76s)]
*  This is more about us, the data collectors, and whether in all cases, whether it is in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=489.96s)]
*  Gaza under Hamas or in Jerusalem when we collect data with the Israeli police and in the West [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=496.96s)]
*  Bank where the Palestinian security services arrest data collectors. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=505.96s)]
*  This is true in all three places. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=509.96s)]
*  Our data collectors have been arrested in all these places. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=511.96s)]
*  We send people to collect data and we know that there is a risk that they are taking [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=515.1600000000001s)]
*  and the extent to which we are willing to put them in that position is extremely difficult. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=521.1600000000001s)]
*  This is more about our own willingness to challenge authorities, to take risks, whether [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=529.1600000000001s)]
*  it is about the data collectors themselves or ourselves. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, occasionally we feel that we can't continue, that the pressure is just too much. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=538.36s)]
*  So the question becomes whether we would allow this to bias our own work. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=548.36s)]
*  To what extent are we willing, because of this authoritarian nature of the system, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=553.36s)]
*  to what extent are we willing to turn a blind eye to certain issues, certain questions? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=558.36s)]
*  To what extent are we willing to frame the questions in a manner that perhaps can give [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  us answers that would reduce the political pressure? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  These are all challenges that we confront and face all the time. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  If I am to critique my own work, I would say that to a large extent, I'm not risk-avert [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  and I'm willing to take the risks to myself, which of course is not important, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=591.76s)]
*  but it is the risk to our data collectors that I feel sometimes that I shouldn't be taken. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=597.76s)]
*  You have Khalil and you operate in a different environment than Dalia. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=610.76s)]
*  Both of you have maintained an extraordinary degree of courage and integrity [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=613.76s)]
*  in the polling and the analysis that you do. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=617.96s)]
*  I want to move on to the past. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=620.96s)]
*  Faulkner, I've used this quote before, in Requiem for a Nun, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=622.96s)]
*  it's one of my favorite quotes, said, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=627.96s)]
*  the past is never dead, it's never even past. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=629.96s)]
*  And the reality is if there is a conflict about which that pertains, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=633.96s)]
*  it is clearly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=637.96s)]
*  So I want to ask both of you at the outset, it's very hard, 15, 16 months, a long time, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=640.96s)]
*  each of you confront multivaried constituencies. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  But let me ask you over the past 15 months, Dalia, first with you, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=653.1600000000001s)]
*  what are the two or three significant takeaways that you've identified [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  with respect to Israeli views of the war and Israeli views toward Palestinians? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=663.1600000000001s)]
*  And Khalil, I'll ask you the same question. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  To you first, Dalia. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=672.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that in a way, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=674.36s)]
*  the data and the trends over all that time are surprisingly easy for a pollster to watch. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=677.36s)]
*  Maybe it's changing a little bit in the last few weeks since the war restarted. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=683.36s)]
*  But the reason I say the trends are easy is because they've been remarkably consistent [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=686.36s)]
*  on some of these points that we're talking about. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=690.36s)]
*  There are, I would say, a few very clear trends. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=693.36s)]
*  One is that in the beginning, of course, there was very high support for the war among Israelis. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=696.36s)]
*  I should point out that from the beginning and through to the present, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  there have been almost completely opposite views of the war [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  between Jewish and Arab or Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=707.5600000000001s)]
*  But the average is still very high because the Jewish support for the war has been so high. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  And that takes various forms. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=715.5600000000001s)]
*  I should point out that most surveys don't ask, do you support or oppose the war? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not a question Israelis are asking themselves. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  It comes out in different forms. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you think Israel is using the right amount of force? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you justify what Israel has done since October 7th? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  But in those various forms, there's been a consensus for most of this time. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=730.76s)]
*  Now, it is declining. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=734.76s)]
*  And it is declining in the form of questions mostly asked by the surveys [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=735.76s)]
*  of the Institute for National Security Studies in Israel [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=742.76s)]
*  that have been testing confidence in Israel's ability to achieve the war aims [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=744.76s)]
*  and confidence that the IDF will win the war. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=749.76s)]
*  Those numbers have been declining since about the spring of 2024. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=752.76s)]
*  Now, they're still not a real minority, but there's still a significant portion [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=758.96s)]
*  of the Israeli public, particularly the Jewish public, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=763.96s)]
*  who thinks Israel will somehow achieve its goals. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=766.96s)]
*  But you see the decline and it's been consistent over time. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=769.96s)]
*  And the reason is also very clear. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=772.96s)]
*  And that comes through in other polling showing very consistently [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=775.96s)]
*  that the majority of Israelis, close to 60% in various questions [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=779.96s)]
*  asking this in different ways, who believe that the government, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=783.96s)]
*  particularly Netanyahu, is making its decisions for the wrong reasons. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=787.1600000000001s)]
*  They believe the government is making its decisions [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=790.1600000000001s)]
*  for personal political interests of Netanyahu, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=793.1600000000001s)]
*  of keeping the coalition together. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  And that includes decision making with relation to the hostages. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=798.1600000000001s)]
*  I should point out that we learn a lot just from questions that are being asked. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=801.1600000000001s)]
*  And I find it really extraordinary in a way [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=805.1600000000001s)]
*  that in the middle of this entire war, throughout the war, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  there have been questions in all of the major mainstream media outlets [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=810.1600000000001s)]
*  in their surveys asking, what do you think are the main considerations [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=814.36s)]
*  of the prime minister with relation to decision making on the war [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=818.36s)]
*  or decision making on the hostages? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=821.36s)]
*  Is it personal political considerations or the good of the hostages [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=823.36s)]
*  or the good of the country? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=826.36s)]
*  And that's just extraordinary because those questions are being asked [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=828.36s)]
*  knowing that many people will have an opinion about that issue. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=831.36s)]
*  That brings me to the second major insight, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=834.36s)]
*  which is that Israel experienced the reverse in public opinion [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=837.36s)]
*  of what you would see in most countries during wartime, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  which is that instead of the classic rally round the flag effect, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  which usually provides a boost of support, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  a major wave of support for the government and the leadership [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  in addition to national patriotism and a sense of solidarity, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  Israel saw the reverse. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  In other words, support for the government crashed immediately after the war [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  in all polls and stayed very low throughout roughly [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  the first six months of the war. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=869.76s)]
*  And then it began to recover. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=871.76s)]
*  And these trends, when I say this is easy for a pollster, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=873.76s)]
*  the trends are very consistent. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=875.76s)]
*  Again, every poll that's done kind of confirms them [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=877.76s)]
*  and these are all different polls, sometimes different questions, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=879.76s)]
*  commissioned by anywhere from research institutes to media outlets, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=881.76s)]
*  including my own polling. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=886.76s)]
*  They show a recovery starting around mid-2024 [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=888.76s)]
*  so that the government has kind of gone back to where it was before the war, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=892.76s)]
*  which was not great. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=897.96s)]
*  It was not doing as well as it had in the 2022 elections. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=899.96s)]
*  But the government did recover from this very, very low point. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=903.96s)]
*  And I think the final thing that you asked about [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=907.96s)]
*  is how do Israelis see Palestinians? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=910.96s)]
*  And this is also a pretty easy trend to analyze [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=913.96s)]
*  because it's consistent with the trends that we generally see [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=916.96s)]
*  when there are escalations on the Israeli-Palestinian front. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=920.96s)]
*  We've seen it during and following the wars in Gaza from 2008 onward, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  which is that every time there's a severe escalation, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=930.1600000000001s)]
*  the Israeli public becomes more hard-line towards Palestinians. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=932.1600000000001s)]
*  The levels of trust have been declining for some years [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  in our joint Israeli-Palestinian research that Khalil and I conduct together. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=940.1600000000001s)]
*  Perceptions that the other side wants peace have gone down significantly. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=945.1600000000001s)]
*  All of that was happening before this war. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=949.1600000000001s)]
*  Those findings were particularly low in our survey from December 2022, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=952.36s)]
*  and it was mutual. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=956.36s)]
*  During the war, what we saw is Israelis' attitudes towards, for example, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=958.36s)]
*  peaceful solutions to the conflict based on a two-state solution [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=962.36s)]
*  and everything that goes along with a two-state solution [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=966.36s)]
*  have been declining very significantly. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=969.36s)]
*  The sense of feasibility for a two-state solution has declined significantly. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=972.36s)]
*  The gap between those Israelis, particularly Israeli Jews, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=976.36s)]
*  who think that it is no longer feasible [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  and those who believe it is feasible is enormous right now. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  So it shouldn't be a surprise because it's consistent. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not a reversal of opinion. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=989.5600000000001s)]
*  But wars make the Israeli public more hard-line. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=991.5600000000001s)]
*  I'll discuss the Palestinian side on pretty much every measure [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  with relation to Palestinians. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  For that purpose, I would appropriate another quote [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  that generals are always fighting the last war, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1005.5600000000001s)]
*  from a public perspective, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1008.76s)]
*  when you're at war, you're always laying the groundwork for the next war. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1010.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1014.76s)]
*  One quick follow-up. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1015.76s)]
*  The initial decline in the first five, six months, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1017.76s)]
*  a consequence of the greatest intelligence failure in Israel's history [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1021.76s)]
*  and the absence of operational competency in the part of the IDF [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1025.76s)]
*  to rescue those Gaza envelope communities in the first 48 hours [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1031.76s)]
*  of Hamas' attack. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1035.96s)]
*  Is that basically why? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1037.96s)]
*  I think that it's a little more complicated than that. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1041.96s)]
*  If you look at polls testing levels of trust in institutions, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1043.96s)]
*  the Shin Bet still enjoys majority trust, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1047.96s)]
*  despite the fact that the government has worked hard [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1050.96s)]
*  to blame the Shin Bet for all the failures. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1053.96s)]
*  And of course, the Shin Bet has enormous responsibility for failures. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1055.96s)]
*  Trust in the army is still extremely high. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1058.96s)]
*  It is the most trusted institution in Israeli society. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1061.96s)]
*  And so I actually think that people are primarily blaming the political level [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1065.16s)]
*  because the political level took the worst hit in public attitudes. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1069.16s)]
*  And I think that, yes, that there's a three-part source of this anger. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1072.16s)]
*  The failure to detect and prevent the attack, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1077.16s)]
*  the failure to respond on that day, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1080.16s)]
*  and the failure to cope with the aftermath, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1082.16s)]
*  the immediate aftermath of tens of thousands of displaced Israelis, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1085.16s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of reservists called up, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1088.16s)]
*  and the state was basically in a chaotic situation, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1090.16s)]
*  couldn't cope with them. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1093.3600000000001s)]
*  If it hadn't been for mobilization of civil society, those communities, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1094.3600000000001s)]
*  both of those groups would have been kind of stranded. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think that, again, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1100.3600000000001s)]
*  seeing how clearly the data has supported the institutions [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1102.3600000000001s)]
*  that would have been responsible for the operational failures, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  and yet the real punishing opinions were leveled at the government [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1108.3600000000001s)]
*  and at the prime minister, especially in those first few months [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1112.3600000000001s)]
*  when all of the fighting was about Gaza, right, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  and very little in the north. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1118.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that the evidence is pretty clear [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1120.56s)]
*  that Israelis were primarily blaming the government [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1122.56s)]
*  for its chaotic and divisive leadership during 2023, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1124.56s)]
*  the attempt to pass the deeply unpopular judicial reforms [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1128.56s)]
*  which led to mass protests and disruptions in Israeli society. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1132.56s)]
*  And I think the fundamental perspective goes back to [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1135.56s)]
*  something that the defense minister at the time [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1138.56s)]
*  had warned about in March 2023, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1140.56s)]
*  which was that the security threats were growing [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1142.56s)]
*  and the government wasn't paying attention [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1144.56s)]
*  because it was too consumed by trying to pass this reform. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1146.56s)]
*  I should say that the head of the opposition, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1149.76s)]
*  Yair Lapid, said this publicly about two weeks before the attack. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1151.76s)]
*  So it was no secret that the government [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1155.76s)]
*  was not really doing its job, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1157.76s)]
*  and the public clearly took that perspective. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1159.76s)]
*  Right. Khalil, over to you now. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1161.76s)]
*  On the last 15, 16 months, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1164.76s)]
*  keeping in mind differences between the West Bank and Gaza, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1166.76s)]
*  what are your key takeaways? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1170.76s)]
*  I think there are three important takeaways. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1174.76s)]
*  Some are expected, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1177.96s)]
*  while others are counterintuitive findings [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1180.96s)]
*  contradicting previous findings in similar situations. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1185.96s)]
*  Perhaps the most expected [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1190.96s)]
*  is that narratives have changed, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1193.96s)]
*  narratives of Palestinians [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1196.96s)]
*  in the joint survey of Israelis as well. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1198.96s)]
*  And the most important narratives that have changed [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1201.96s)]
*  are those that are related to how people assess the threat [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1205.16s)]
*  of the other side. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1209.16s)]
*  What has changed is the intensity of the threat perception, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1211.16s)]
*  the belief that we don't pose a threat, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1216.16s)]
*  but the other side poses an existential threat. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1221.16s)]
*  This has been accentuated greatly [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1224.16s)]
*  as a result of what happened on October 7th [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1227.16s)]
*  and the ongoing war. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1230.16s)]
*  Therefore, the belief that I don't have a partner, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1232.3600000000001s)]
*  that the other side, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1237.3600000000001s)]
*  therefore, we need to find ways [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  in which we can eliminate the other side [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1242.3600000000001s)]
*  rather than make peace with the other side. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1245.3600000000001s)]
*  Formative developments like October 7th [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1248.3600000000001s)]
*  and the ongoing war shape attitudes. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1252.3600000000001s)]
*  And in this case, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  these narratives about the nature of the conflict [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1258.3600000000001s)]
*  and the nature of the threat that the other side is posing [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1261.56s)]
*  have very important impact [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1265.56s)]
*  on how people assess who the other side is. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1269.56s)]
*  The level of dehumanization, for example, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1273.56s)]
*  that we have found is almost complete. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1275.56s)]
*  The overwhelming majority, almost everybody [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1279.56s)]
*  among Israeli Jews and Palestinians [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1282.56s)]
*  is willing to dehumanize the other side. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1285.56s)]
*  The empirical evidence that we have seen [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1289.56s)]
*  in our joint surveys basically show [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1293.56s)]
*  that these narratives directly impact [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1296.56s)]
*  the willingness to support war, sustain war, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1302.56s)]
*  and to oppose peace or support peace [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1306.56s)]
*  for those who are able to overcome these narratives. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1310.56s)]
*  We have found when we offered people [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1315.56s)]
*  a package leading up to permanent peace [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1319.56s)]
*  between Israelis and Palestinians [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1325.56s)]
*  along the lines of a two-state solution, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1327.56s)]
*  that those who had the most extreme narratives [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1329.56s)]
*  about the threat posed by the other side [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1332.56s)]
*  tend to be much less willing to support peace [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1335.56s)]
*  and the peace plan that we presented them. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1340.56s)]
*  While those who had a little bit different narrative [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1344.56s)]
*  about the nature of the threat were, in fact, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1348.56s)]
*  in the Palestinian case, the majority of Palestinians [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1352.56s)]
*  who viewed the nature of the threat, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1356.56s)]
*  whether this is genocide, ethnic cleansing, etc., [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1360.56s)]
*  those who viewed the nature of the threat in such terms [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1364.56s)]
*  were strongly opposed to making peace. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1369.56s)]
*  While those who were willing to consider other narratives [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1372.56s)]
*  about the nature of the threat were twice or even three times [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1376.56s)]
*  willing to support that package that we have presented. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1380.56s)]
*  So the hardening of the narratives [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1383.56s)]
*  has become a very serious issue that has impacted attitudes. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1386.56s)]
*  That was to be expected. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1390.56s)]
*  What was not to be expected has been whether, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1392.56s)]
*  given all of this dramatic change [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1398.56s)]
*  in the perception of the threat, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1401.56s)]
*  whether you can still convince people that making peace [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1403.56s)]
*  is better than continuing this route, living by the sword. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1408.56s)]
*  And when Dali and I and our other colleagues [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1412.56s)]
*  went into this survey, my own expectation was that [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1417.56s)]
*  we will find little willingness to support peace [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1421.56s)]
*  based on our previous surveys, that what worked in the past, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1425.56s)]
*  that this was a watershed, that we are not going to find [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1429.56s)]
*  willingness to support peace anymore. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1433.56s)]
*  And we were absolutely wrong. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1435.56s)]
*  We found that all these things that have worked in the past [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1438.56s)]
*  in terms of meeting the vital needs, restating the vital needs, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1442.56s)]
*  providing incentives for both Israelis and Palestinians, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1447.56s)]
*  has actually proven to be highly effective in overcoming [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1452.56s)]
*  these very, very negative narratives [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1456.56s)]
*  about the nature of the threat. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1460.56s)]
*  So we can claim that even today with all the dramatic changes [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1462.56s)]
*  and the dehumanization that we have seen, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1468.56s)]
*  we are still able to find a majority of Israeli Jews and Palestinians [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1473.56s)]
*  who are willing to support a very detailed peace package [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1478.56s)]
*  that they have supported in the past, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1483.56s)]
*  that a majority would still be willing to support it again, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1486.56s)]
*  given ensuring that their vital needs are met [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1489.56s)]
*  and that the right incentives are provided. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1493.56s)]
*  On the domestic side, I think the most important is the distinction [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1497.56s)]
*  between Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1501.56s)]
*  While West Bankers were not willing to be critical [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1503.56s)]
*  and skeptical of what Hamas did on October the 7th, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1507.56s)]
*  Gazans were much less willing to support, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1511.56s)]
*  had to support Hamas or to support October the 7th. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1517.56s)]
*  Gazans were a lot more critical. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1522.56s)]
*  The West Bank became a lot more critical of its own leadership [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1525.56s)]
*  of Abbas, but were willing to turn a blind eye [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1530.56s)]
*  to everything that Hamas had done [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1535.56s)]
*  and to support a lot of the things that Hamas had done. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1537.56s)]
*  Now, in Gaza, we have found that perceptions, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1541.56s)]
*  particularly over time, since October the 7th, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1545.56s)]
*  have changed significantly and that there is much greater accountability [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1548.56s)]
*  that Gazans are willing to be critical [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1553.56s)]
*  and as we've seen during the last few days, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1557.56s)]
*  people are willing to go down the streets [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1562.56s)]
*  to demonstrate against Hamas. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1564.56s)]
*  This is not something that we are likely to see in the West Bank, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1566.56s)]
*  but certainly we could see in Gaza. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1570.56s)]
*  We've seen it in Gaza, by the way, before October the 7th, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1574.56s)]
*  and most likely we'll continue to see it in Gaza. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1577.56s)]
*  You've provided a great transition into the present, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1582.56s)]
*  so let me stay with you, Khalil Anish, the issue of Hamas. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1586.56s)]
*  We've seen protests unprecedented since October 7th. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1590.56s)]
*  An organization, We Want to Live, Bid'in Naish, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1594.56s)]
*  seems to have been involved. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1598.56s)]
*  They are presumably Fatah supporters. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1601.56s)]
*  I'm just wondering, can you drill down a little more deeply? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1604.56s)]
*  They protested in 2019 and again in 2023. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1609.56s)]
*  Those protests seem to have stopped. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1613.56s)]
*  Can you just give us a sort of resketch in your view [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1615.56s)]
*  of what the dynamic here on the ground is? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1619.56s)]
*  There were at least two occasions in the past, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1623.56s)]
*  one in the wake of the Arab Spring in 2011, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1627.56s)]
*  in which Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1631.56s)]
*  were willing to rise against the existing regimes [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1634.56s)]
*  and to demand regime change, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1638.56s)]
*  just like what was happening in the rest of the Arab world. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1640.56s)]
*  Those demonstrations were cracked on strongly by Hamas [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1645.56s)]
*  than in the West Bank, but in both cases, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1651.56s)]
*  there was a crackdown on demonstrations that have stopped it. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1653.56s)]
*  In Gaza, just a few months before October the 7th, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1657.56s)]
*  in July 2023, there were demonstrations by youth in Gaza against Hamas. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1662.56s)]
*  The same cry was basically, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1668.56s)]
*  wanted a change in living conditions, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1673.56s)]
*  life was becoming intolerable. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1677.56s)]
*  This is what we are currently seeing. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1680.56s)]
*  In part, of course, we shouldn't be surprised [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1683.56s)]
*  because Hamas has never in its entire history [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1687.56s)]
*  received a majority of support. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1691.56s)]
*  There was always a majority of Gazans, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1694.56s)]
*  and West Bankers by the way, who opposed Hamas. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1697.56s)]
*  Hamas never had a majority of support to begin with. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1701.56s)]
*  Even when it won the elections in 2006, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1705.56s)]
*  it won the elections by a minority, not by a majority. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1709.56s)]
*  The electoral system, our electoral system, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1712.56s)]
*  gave Hamas the majority of seats, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1715.56s)]
*  but it never won a majority of the popular vote. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1717.56s)]
*  We have seen that on the eve of October the 7th, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1721.56s)]
*  the joint surveys, the surveys that we have done [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1727.56s)]
*  as part of the Arab Barometer, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1730.56s)]
*  have also shown the significant skepticism about governance [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1732.56s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip in particular. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1736.56s)]
*  The trust in the Hamas government was just slightly over one quarter of Gazans. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1738.56s)]
*  I say all of this just to say that Hamas control over Gaza [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1745.56s)]
*  has never had a majority of support. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1751.56s)]
*  One shouldn't be surprised that there would be demonstrations against Hamas. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1754.56s)]
*  What had prevented that in the past is of course the nature of the political system, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1759.56s)]
*  the authoritarian nature of the political system [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1765.56s)]
*  that made it extremely costly for people to express criticism of Hamas. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1768.56s)]
*  Now, to a large extent, this is something that is however unlikely [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1777.56s)]
*  to continue in Gaza or to have consequences. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1784.56s)]
*  The reason for that is that despite the decline in the popularity of Hamas, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1787.56s)]
*  there is really no alternative. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1794.56s)]
*  Right now, we are seeing by Gazans as better than Hamas. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1796.56s)]
*  I doubt very much that Farah is capable right now [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1800.56s)]
*  of organizing a very strong opposition to Hamas [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1805.56s)]
*  because Farah has been weakened, significantly weakened [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1808.56s)]
*  through the years in which Hamas controlled Gaza. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1812.56s)]
*  It is highly unlikely that Farah would be able to sustain any long-term opposition to Hamas [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1816.56s)]
*  just because again, it does not have the support of the public. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1823.56s)]
*  It is not trusted. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1828.56s)]
*  Its leadership in particular is not trusted by Gazans or West bankers. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1829.56s)]
*  And on top of that, so if you do not have an alternative leadership, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1835.56s)]
*  you also do not have an alternative government. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1839.56s)]
*  Hamas currently is disliked. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1843.56s)]
*  Yes, that is true. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1846.56s)]
*  Nonetheless, if you have to choose between having some level of order [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1848.56s)]
*  that Hamas can provide, some level of management, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1853.56s)]
*  how do you manage humanitarian service delivery? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1857.56s)]
*  How do you manage social services? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1859.56s)]
*  How do you manage several defense units? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1861.56s)]
*  How do you manage the delivery of health care? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1864.56s)]
*  How do you ensure that markets are open and merchants can open their shops? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1868.56s)]
*  All of these things are available to Gazans today [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1874.56s)]
*  because Hamas is able to enforce a level of order. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1878.56s)]
*  Well, if Gazans can see that if Hamas is out, nobody is going to replace it. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1881.56s)]
*  And the reason for that is because Israel is opposed to allowing either the PA [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1888.56s)]
*  or some other kind of Arab plan or a Palestinian plan [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1893.56s)]
*  to create an alternative leadership and an alternative government to control Gaza. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1901.56s)]
*  In the absence of that alternative, we are not likely to see enthusiasm in Gaza [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1907.56s)]
*  against Hamas' revolt to force Hamas to step down. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1914.56s)]
*  That is not what Gazans would want to see happening. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1920.56s)]
*  So these demonstrations will most likely not be able to continue, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1923.56s)]
*  not because Hamas is going to crack down, and obviously Hamas will probably crack down on them [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1928.56s)]
*  and prevent them in the future. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1934.56s)]
*  Nonetheless, I think to a large extent, the reason this is going to happen [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1937.56s)]
*  is because Gazans just do not have a better alternative right now. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1943.56s)]
*  Right. It's very well said. It's a fascinating observation. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1948.56s)]
*  Adalia, back to you on the issue of Israeli public opinion. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1954.56s)]
*  I think you wrote that October 7 should have provided a perfect storm [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1958.56s)]
*  and an intense hardening of the Israeli right. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1965.56s)]
*  And I think you questioned to some degree, I may be getting this wrong, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1970.56s)]
*  has that happened essentially? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1975.56s)]
*  And if it has or hasn't, where are the fault lines now in Israeli public opinion? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1978.56s)]
*  Left, right, pro-Nitanyahu, anti-Nitanyahu, pro-occupation, anti-occupation. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1985.56s)]
*  Where does Israeli public opinion divide these days? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1992.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=1999.56s)]
*  I think certainly I wrote after October 7 that based on everything we've seen [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2001.56s)]
*  about public opinion dynamics in other phases of escalation, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2005.56s)]
*  I would have expected the Israeli public to move even further to the right. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2008.56s)]
*  It was already majority right-wing, especially among the Jewish population [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2012.56s)]
*  because among the Arab population that brings down the national average [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2016.56s)]
*  of self-identified right-wingers because very few of them identify as right-wing. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2020.56s)]
*  But we know from election results, it was at that point before the war, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2025.56s)]
*  or let's say even let's take the peak when the last government was elected in November 2022, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2029.56s)]
*  you had well over 60%, about 65% of Jewish Israelis who identified as right-wing. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2035.56s)]
*  What was interesting is that during 2023, that number had declined somewhat, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2041.56s)]
*  very slowly and incrementally over the course of the major protests against the government. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2045.56s)]
*  And sure enough, the first indications after October 7 was that self-identification [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2051.56s)]
*  with the right-wing, and again, I check numerous surveys, especially tracking surveys [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2056.56s)]
*  that go over this question in each survey, including my own surveys. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2061.56s)]
*  So even if you ask the question a little bit differently in different surveys, you get the same trend. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2065.56s)]
*  Everybody showed an upward trend line for people self-identifying as right-wing. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2069.56s)]
*  Up to close to I think 68% of the Jewish population was the highest that I saw. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2075.56s)]
*  And self-identification with left-wing dropped below 10%, which is particularly low, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2081.56s)]
*  although it was already low, it was generally in the 13-14% range among the Jewish population, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2085.56s)]
*  20% let's say among all Israelis. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2090.56s)]
*  And so I thought, well, here we go. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2093.56s)]
*  There's going to be nothing left of the left, as we've been saying for years. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2095.56s)]
*  Self-identified right-wing is just going to keep going up until it's 100%, something like that. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2098.56s)]
*  And no, that didn't happen. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2103.56s)]
*  Actually, what did happen is that the self-identification numbers plateaued [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2105.56s)]
*  and then eventually reverted to roughly where they were before the war, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2110.56s)]
*  which again was a little bit lower than usual for the right-wing self-identification relative to the election. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2114.56s)]
*  But still the majority of the Jewish population, but not nearly what they were at that peak a few weeks after the war, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2120.56s)]
*  or the month or two after the war. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2127.56s)]
*  And same thing with the self-identified left, which recovered from that downwards spiral [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2129.56s)]
*  and came back to the fairly low point, but stable point of about 12%, 13%, 14% among the Jewish population, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2134.56s)]
*  the total average being about 20%. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2143.56s)]
*  And evidence that these self-identification questions matter can be seen in all of the electoral surveys. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2145.56s)]
*  We have weekly electoral surveys. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2152.56s)]
*  We have from one news outlet and many news outlets do them every few weeks. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2154.56s)]
*  And so we have ongoing trends on the electoral surveys that show the manifestation of these self-identified left, right, and center attitudes, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2159.56s)]
*  which is that the original coalition that Netanyahu put together in late 2022 has been unable to win a majority. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2169.56s)]
*  And the party, it hasn't been able to win a majority in any of them except for the pet polling agency [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2177.56s)]
*  that is essentially a sort of a partner of a very right-wing television channel. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2185.56s)]
*  But all of the other ones show very consistently that it can't win a majority. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2189.56s)]
*  And more than that, the party that now represents the Israeli left, which is called the Democrats Party, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2192.56s)]
*  which merged to other parties, Labor and Merits, has been polling at around 14 seats when the current Knesset representation of those two parties combined was four seats. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2197.56s)]
*  So I wouldn't overstate the case. Yeah, it is interesting. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2207.56s)]
*  It's not I wouldn't overstate the case because, you know, the fact that one of those two parties didn't get in, didn't cross the electoral threshold was a matter of just a very few number of votes. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2210.56s)]
*  They could have had eight seats if the two parties had passed. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2219.56s)]
*  Still, it is notable. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2222.56s)]
*  Now, the counterpoint of that argument is that, A, I wouldn't say the numbers are radically changing in the opposite direction. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2224.56s)]
*  There's still a majority who are right-wing and a minority who are left-wing, and the center is about a quarter. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2232.56s)]
*  But it has stabilized and gone back to where it was before the war. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2237.56s)]
*  However, when you look at policy positions, you see that there are very extreme policy positions in Israel that have the support of a majority or close to half of the Israeli public. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2241.56s)]
*  For example, things like resettling Gaza. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2252.56s)]
*  You know, there has been a majority for that at times. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2254.56s)]
*  Right now, it's I think the latest peace index survey by our same colleagues at Tel Aviv University who work on our joint survey together has that just below half of the Israeli public, even the Jewish public, supports rebuilding settlements in Gaza. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2258.56s)]
*  You have a majority, according to the most recent INSS survey in March, that support some form, some aspect of the renewed war. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2271.56s)]
*  57%, whether it's the air campaign or expanding to a ground campaign. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2281.56s)]
*  And so these belligerent attitudes still, you know, on the one hand, they're consistent with a number of right-wingers, but also, you know, you have a very large portion of, or I would say more extreme policy positions on some level. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2287.56s)]
*  So what it means to be right-wing or even the support of some of the centrists, for example, for some of these policies, including even expulsion of Gazans, which whether that's phrased as voluntarily or by force, again, in the last peace index survey has a surprising level of support. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2302.56s)]
*  So what it means to be right-wing, even if the numbers are stabilizing, has more extreme manifestations. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2320.56s)]
*  It really is fascinating. It gets, I think, the broader point, which I want to close on, but I want to deal with two more issues in the time that remains. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2328.56s)]
*  One is denialism. Now, Dal, you've written quite a bit on why and how the prosecution of Israel's war against Hamas and the exponential rise of Palestinian civilian deaths, humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, why this has failed or not to penetrate and to have any impact on Israeli public opinion. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2341.56s)]
*  By the same token, there's denialism on the Palestinian side, I believe, and you can correct me, Khalil, if I'm wrong here, on what happened on October 7, the indiscriminate killing of civilians, the sexual predation, the mutilation, the taking of hostages. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2369.56s)]
*  To you first, Dalia. Why the, I mean, am I correct? Denialism is pervasive? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2389.56s)]
*  I think there is, yeah, there is a form of denialism. I think that, you know, specifically there was a phase when, you know, areas of northern Gaza were facing such severe shortages of food and blockage of aid that they were basically facing starvation, and Israelis were in complete denial about that. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2397.56s)]
*  But in general, the funny thing, it's not funny, but the tragic part of this is I think that overall there's not as much denialism on the Israeli side right now, so much as there is an acknowledgement and justification. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2412.56s)]
*  And I think that both of those phenomena, the denialism such as there, well, there is denialism. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2423.56s)]
*  I mean, again, about the situation of humanitarian aid, there's a lot of denialism over the past, right? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2429.56s)]
*  Apropos the past never leaving and always being with us, or one of my favorite thinkers, George Orwell, who said the great privilege of the winners is not that they rewrite the future, but that they rewrite the past. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2435.56s)]
*  And there is a denialism about the nature of Israeli control over both Gaza and the West Bank for all of these years. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2447.56s)]
*  Israelis say, well, we gave it back and look what they've done. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2454.56s)]
*  They had their own lives, they controlled their own lives, and what have they done? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2457.56s)]
*  So that's a denialism of Israel's role in controlling both of those territories in different ways over the years. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2461.56s)]
*  And there is a denialism of Israel's responsibility, for example, for the humanitarian aid or the lack of humanitarian access for humanitarian aid over this time. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2468.56s)]
*  But I think both the denialism and the justification has the same source. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2477.56s)]
*  And that is very evident in, again, I'm going back to our joint survey, which we've conducted in July, but we've asked the question in the past, too. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2482.56s)]
*  We have a question where we ask each side, and I'll just give the Israeli Jewish version, which is that we Israeli Jews have suffered more persecution than other people in conflicts around the world. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2490.56s)]
*  And what we saw is that over 80 percent of Israelis agree with that statement. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2500.56s)]
*  OK, I'm going to leave you in suspense about the Palestinian side. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2504.56s)]
*  But the point is when people feel that they are the victim, the sole victim and the worst victim, I mean, the most threatened victim, they will justify the actions they take. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2507.56s)]
*  I'll go to another question that we asked, which is what do you think are the intentions of Palestinians, of the Palestinian leadership in the long term? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2518.56s)]
*  The majority, two thirds of Israelis, have the most extreme image of long term Palestinian intentions and two thirds believe that on October 7th Hamas and Palestinians from Gaza were trying to commit genocide. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2524.56s)]
*  So it's the justification for Israel's actions, whether it's denialism or justification. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2538.56s)]
*  I think that they all come from the same source, which is the sense that Israelis view themselves as the exclusive threatened party, which I think is probably characteristic of many of these conflicts. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2544.56s)]
*  Each side sees itself as the only victim. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2553.56s)]
*  Khalil over to you on the issue of October 7th. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2556.56s)]
*  I think it's a combination. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2561.56s)]
*  Yes, there is, of course, denialism. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2563.56s)]
*  The denialism that we see, it comes from three sources. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2566.56s)]
*  One, just like in the Israeli Jewish case, the belief that the other side is out to destroy us, wipe us from the map, the genocide, the perception of genocide, ethnic cleansing and so on. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2572.56s)]
*  This is extremely important for the Palestinians. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2589.56s)]
*  Also, particularly in Gaza, it is the previous four wars in which Israel and the perception of the Palestinians have committed all kinds of atrocities and were able to get away with those atrocities against civilians throughout all of these encounters. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2593.56s)]
*  That is part that feeds into this denialism. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2612.56s)]
*  This is another part, and that is Hamas's ability to have a very strong voice to transmit its narrative. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2616.56s)]
*  Hamas has been highly successful with the most successful media. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2626.56s)]
*  It was able to utilize Al Jazeera, but it's not Al Jazeera. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2632.56s)]
*  Certainly Al Jazeera has been the most effective because it is the most popular. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2636.56s)]
*  More than 80% of Palestinians see Al Jazeera as the main source of information. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2641.56s)]
*  So Al Jazeera is very popular. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2647.56s)]
*  And the narratives in Al Jazeera about what happened are essentially Hamas's narrative. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2649.56s)]
*  And that narrative denies any kind of atrocities being committed. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2654.56s)]
*  So that brings me to the third source of denialism, which is a mixture of ignorance and not wanting to know. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2658.56s)]
*  Ignorance in the sense when we ask people what are the sources of information? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2666.56s)]
*  Haven't you seen videos? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2670.56s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2672.56s)]
*  Why haven't you seen that is because the main source of information that I go to did not show. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2674.56s)]
*  So the combination of all three provides a fertile ground for people to deny that any of these things have happened. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2682.56s)]
*  And so we see the overwhelming majority, 80 or even 90% of the Palestinians, express the view that there were no atrocities committed on October the 7th. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2692.56s)]
*  Of course, they can't deny that Hamas has taken civilian hostages. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2704.56s)]
*  On this issue where people are not willing to deny that fact, we actually see, particularly in Gaza, but also in the West Bank, a great deal of criticism of Hamas. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2708.56s)]
*  The belief of Palestinians that this is against international law, that this is a war crime, is something that is shared by the majority of the Palestinians. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2720.56s)]
*  This is the one area where we do see, particularly in Gaza, a very clear critique of what Hamas had done on that day. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2730.56s)]
*  But if you ask about any other thing that was reported to have happened on October the 7th, you will find a wall of denial, complete denial on the part of the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian public. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2740.56s)]
*  One final question. We may go over a minute or two. I have to ask it though. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2755.56s)]
*  I'm probably one of the rapidly declining group of humans who actually believes that a conflict-rening solution between Israelis and Palestinians is possible, and that the way to get there is separation through negotiation. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2760.56s)]
*  You can call it the two-state solution, separation through negotiation. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2774.56s)]
*  I'm wondering briefly what each of you are pulling suggests on this issue as a possible pathway forward. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2779.56s)]
*  Dalia, you first. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2789.56s)]
*  Sure. On the Israeli side, what we've seen is a significant decline, as I mentioned, in support for the very general notion of a two-state solution when we ask it an open kind of question. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2791.56s)]
*  Among the entire Israeli public now, we have dipped below 30% who support it, and just about 20% of the Jewish Israeli public support remains high, always a majority among Arab or Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2801.56s)]
*  The notion of separation as a concept has somewhat more traction. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2814.56s)]
*  I wouldn't say it's hugely popular, but it has more traction than when you just ask about the two-state solution. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2822.56s)]
*  The question is asked in various different ways. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2827.56s)]
*  I have to say that when I hear people talking, there's always a qualitative dimension to this as well. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2830.56s)]
*  When I hear people talking about separation now, I have the increasing, especially based on the numbers that I've seen, which are public data from the Peace Index in Tel Aviv University about support for voluntary or forced evacuation, which is what we call it in Hebrew. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2836.56s)]
*  Of Palestinians from Gaza. Increasingly, when I see Israelis talking about here, Israelis talking about separation, I have come to suspect that they believe that they are thinking about separation from the Palestinian population, not dividing the land. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2851.56s)]
*  So I think that we have to also understand what they really have in mind. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2865.56s)]
*  I will say one personal opinion is that my analysis of what's happening on the ground beyond public opinion, but as a policy analyst, I think that the separation paradigm, to the extent that it has been implemented somewhat over decades, both in terms of how Oslo ultimately was implemented with no Palestinian state as the end game over the decades and the isolation of Gaza, does not speak well of the separation paradigm. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2868.56s)]
*  And I think that's the reason that Gaza was the most isolated piece of land between the river and the sea, and that's also the source of the worst attack on Israel's soil. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2894.56s)]
*  It's a fascinating point. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2904.56s)]
*  Khalil, two states. I should say, and since I gave a shout out to Dahlia and her book, Khalil, you, Abdulmanam Saeed Ali and Shai Feldman have really done a remarkable piece of work. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2908.56s)]
*  You've called Arabs and Israelis from October 7 to peacemaking. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2923.56s)]
*  So maybe you can just give us a line or two on what your polling suggests on two states? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2928.56s)]
*  Well, just like Israeli Jews, the last decade have witnessed significant decline in support for the two-state solution. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2936.56s)]
*  Surprisingly, however, while among Israeli Jews, October the 7th and the ongoing war has created an aversion to the two, a greater aversion to the two-state solution, the opposite has happened among the Palestinians. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2947.56s)]
*  We see greater support for the two-state solution. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2962.56s)]
*  And in fact, if we clearly define what a two-state solution means in terms of the borders of the states, 1967 borders, and if you said East Jerusalem would be the capital of that Palestinian state, this is the official Palestinian negotiating position with regard to the two-state solution. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2966.56s)]
*  Then you get a large majority of Palestinians in favor of the two-state solution. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2986.56s)]
*  So this idea of Palestinian self-determination in the form of ending Israeli occupation, having sovereignty over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem is finding, is basically coming back to give the majority of the Palestinians something that they consider to be a vital goal and objective. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=2991.56s)]
*  And why is that happening, I think is an open question. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3015.56s)]
*  But I think the most perhaps important explanation that I find useful is that the perception of the Palestinians that the threat of genocide, the threat of ethnic cleansing, all these things that they hear about the emerging threats perhaps would not have been as existential if they already have their own state. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3019.56s)]
*  Or if a state is to perhaps even none of this would have happened had there been a Palestinian state in which the Palestinians would have expressed their aspiration for independence and sovereignty. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3046.56s)]
*  Does that mean that the Palestinians would be willing to make concessions, significant concessions painful, to reach a peace agreement that would end the conflict and the occupation? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3061.56s)]
*  The answer is absolutely yes. We do find, again, if you directly ask the question without digging deeper, trying to understand what the vital needs are and try to present these vital needs as something that could be met in such a peace agreement, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3075.56s)]
*  we do find that there is a majority of Palestinians that would be willing to accept the terms that would be required for reaching a peace agreement. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3093.56s)]
*  What clearly, if you look, however, at the surface of things, public opinion among the Palestinians or Israeli Jews is certainly not a force for peace. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3105.56s)]
*  It would require a great deal of leadership. If leaders, however, show willingness to engage in such a process, there is absolutely no doubt that our research indicates that public opinion is not an impediment to moving forward towards peace [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3115.56s)]
*  and a two-state solution. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3134.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know, we've, Dali quoted Orwell, I quoted Faulkner. So let me just close with a quote from Auden's, W.H. Auden's 1940 poem called The Unknown Citizen. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3136.56s)]
*  Here's what he says. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3150.56s)]
*  Our researchers into public opinion are content that he held the proper opinions for the time of year. When there was peace, he was for peace. When there was war, he went. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3152.56s)]
*  Right? Again, when there was peace, he was for peace. When there was war, he went. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3167.56s)]
*  We can't see what's in front of us for good or ill. We don't have the right to compromise future generations. A lot could happen. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3176.56s)]
*  And Khalil, the notion of leadership, and I know, Dali, you agree with this, is the sine qua non, that with which we cannot do without. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3183.56s)]
*  I want to thank the two of you for the work you do individually, for your joint polling, for your authority, your integrity, and your commitment. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3194.56s)]
*  I'll speak for the both of you to a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that ends it once and for all. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3203.56s)]
*  Thanks again, and be well. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3214.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0cvZ7BLQ&t=3218.56s)]
