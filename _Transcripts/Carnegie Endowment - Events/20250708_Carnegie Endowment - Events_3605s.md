# Geothermal Energy's Global Breakthrough | Session 3
**Carnegie Endowment - Events:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk)
*  Zach, I think we, oh, we're back in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=0.0s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=9.8s)]
*  It's nearing the end of the day, and I am just honored and thrilled to be presenting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=12.8s)]
*  our last panel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=20.04s)]
*  Last but certainly not least, this is a conference at the core of it, the question of unlocking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=22.36s)]
*  global geothermal energy, not just here in the United States, but abroad. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=27.76s)]
*  And with that, we have an exceptional group of guests to talk about that, just to introduce [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=33.32s)]
*  some of the talent we have here on stage. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=40.92s)]
*  Drew Nelson, who leads Project Interspace's policy and strategy, the VP of Policy and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=43.8s)]
*  Strategy, for those not aware, Project Interspace is an NGO. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=49.84s)]
*  Lauren mentioned it in your presentation, an NGO really at the forefront of pushing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=54.64s)]
*  next-gen geothermal to countries across the world, and Drew has been a seminal part of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=60.24s)]
*  that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=64.48s)]
*  And Drew, thank you again for this partnership here today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=65.48s)]
*  And then I'll let you introduce our panelists, but it's an all-star team of geothermal leadership [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=68.52s)]
*  and also soon-to-be geothermal emerging players. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=74.88s)]
*  So we are just thrilled to have representation from Kenya, from Indonesia, from the European [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=78.42s)]
*  Union and from Germany. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=84.22s)]
*  Drew, the floor is yours. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=86.06s)]
*  Great. Can you guys hear me in the back? Yeah, great. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=88.5s)]
*  So I'm really excited about this panel. I think there's a lot of really amazing things [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=92.78s)]
*  we can talk about, but I'm also really excited to see so many people in this room, a lot [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=98.1s)]
*  of familiar faces, a lot of new faces, and that's probably the most exciting thing is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=103.82s)]
*  how many people here are engaged and getting excited about geothermal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=108.86s)]
*  So Milo, congratulations to you and the team here at Carnegie for pointing together this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=111.82s)]
*  amazing event, and thank you very much for your hospitality and for raising the awareness [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=115.41999999999999s)]
*  of this awesome issue. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=119.38s)]
*  And so what we're doing today, right now, in this panel, is we're kind of pivoting from [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  the abstract of what does super hot rock potentially look like to what's happening now and how [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=127.46s)]
*  do we get more of it up and running. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=133.72s)]
*  And so to have representatives from two countries that are at the leading edge of geothermal [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=136.78s)]
*  in Kenya and Indonesia, and then two jurisdictions with the European Union and Germany that are [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=143.38s)]
*  very much looking forward to seeing how they can do more geothermal, I think it's an amazing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=150.06s)]
*  mix of perspectives and ideas that I'm really excited about. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=154.38s)]
*  So we're going to jump in with some questions for each of the panelists, but before I do [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=159.46s)]
*  that, I'm going to ask each panelist just to take a second to introduce themselves and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=163.78s)]
*  what they're excited about on geothermal generally. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=167.1s)]
*  So Ambassador, over to you first. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=169.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=171.38s)]
*  Thank you for us very much, for Carnegie and the team that's behind all this, and thank [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=172.38s)]
*  you for having us here today. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=176.06s)]
*  My name is Ambassador Christopher Kirigwa from Kenya. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=177.98s)]
*  I'm very excited about this because geothermal is a very high priority in Kenya. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=180.54s)]
*  Fifty percent of our power in Kenya comes from geothermal, and I'm a career banker. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=184.7s)]
*  I've been involved in funding quite a few geothermal projects, and we look forward to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  partnering with you and engaging more on this important agenda. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=195.9s)]
*  Thank you, Ambassador. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=199.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much, Dan. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=201.06s)]
*  Thank you, Mianlu, for inviting Indonesia here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=202.9s)]
*  My name is Ibrahim Nistumorang. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm the Minister of the Council of the Indonesian Embassy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=207.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm heading the economic team. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=209.82000000000002s)]
*  Energy is not necessarily my direct policy, at least for the last three days. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=212.86s)]
*  I think there are a lot of things that we have to take care of. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=217.98s)]
*  But we are excited to be here because energy is a priority issue for Indonesia, and we [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=220.1s)]
*  see a lot of alignment, including with the U.S. in terms of potential cooperation moving [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=225.06s)]
*  forward. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=230.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=231.46s)]
*  Thank you, Mianlu and Carnegie for inviting us to the European Union. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=232.46s)]
*  I'm Francesco Amaragraziani. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=238.1s)]
*  I'm Energy and Climate Councilor at the EU delegation here in D.C. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=239.1s)]
*  I've been here for around a year and a half. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=243.1s)]
*  Before that, I was around 12 years in Brussels in the Director General for Energy at the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=245.66000000000003s)]
*  European Commission. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=250.3s)]
*  Drew, coming to your question in really two words, there cannot be a more timely discussion [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=251.3s)]
*  about new thermal energy, not only because the European Union is incredibly invested [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=257.58000000000004s)]
*  in developing the technology and the production of heat and power coming from that, but especially [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=262.94s)]
*  from my perspective, my selfish perspective as responsible for the bilateral relationship [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  between the EU and U.S. on energy, there is not a single item that is more bipartisan [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=275.98s)]
*  and shared across not only the political aisle, but also the marketplace and the transatlantic [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=282.7s)]
*  cooperation standpoint that is more important right now than just urban energy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=289.18s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=293.14s)]
*  This is a great opportunity. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=294.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=295.14s)]
*  Hi. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=296.14s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=297.14s)]
*  Thank you, Mianlu, for having me. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=298.14s)]
*  I'm the Energy Counselor of the Embassy of Germany. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  I've been here for two years now, but I'm only covering the energy portfolio for six [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=302.46s)]
*  months now, but I'm very thrilled because it's an extremely important topic, as all [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=308.18s)]
*  of my colleagues have already mentioned, and Germany is, of course, very excited about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=312.38s)]
*  any kind of energy cooperation with the United States and, as you have mentioned before, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=317.41999999999996s)]
*  geothermal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=321.62s)]
*  We agree with Mianlu and all his findings that there is a huge potential for geothermal [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=322.62s)]
*  in general in Germany and also for cooperation, of course. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=326.06s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=329.98s)]
*  Well, it's not every day that you get to be on a panel with representatives from four [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=330.98s)]
*  countries, two of which are in the southern hemisphere, or straddles the equator, I guess, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=337.54s)]
*  in one case, and two of which are in the northern hemisphere, where the emerging economies have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=343.26s)]
*  words of wisdom and experience on how to develop a clean energy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=348.7s)]
*  A lot of too often that goes the other way. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  One of the things that I think is most cool about geothermal is Kenya and Indonesia are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=356.3s)]
*  leading the way. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=360.22s)]
*  They are two of the biggest geothermal power producers in the world. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  And so, Ambassador, and the same question to you when the Ambassador is done, what lessons [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  learned do you want to share with the room and with the other jurisdictions here on the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=372.56s)]
*  panel about what has worked for Kenya and what are some of the things that countries [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  should be looking out for as they seek to develop more geothermal? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=387.7s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=388.7s)]
*  I think from a Kenya perspective, one of the key aspects that made it possible was a government [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=389.7s)]
*  invested significantly on the development phase. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=395.26s)]
*  So the exploration of the geothermal fields, the initial stage was picked up by the government. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  That enabled the government to create an enabling environment for the private sector to come [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=404.9s)]
*  in and invest. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=410.58s)]
*  As we speak right now, Kenya has over 90 percent of its power mixed comes from renewables. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=412.46s)]
*  So 90 percent. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=420.3s)]
*  We've got a target of 100 percent by 2030. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=421.3s)]
*  And the only way we'll be able to achieve that is through geothermal. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=426.34s)]
*  We have a potential currently close to 50, 49 percent of our energy comes from geothermal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=429.82s)]
*  So to get the other 10 percent that doesn't come from clean energy, it's so difficult. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=439.42s)]
*  And with 10,000 potential geothermal, 10,000 megawatts of potential geothermal, there's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=446.3s)]
*  a huge opportunity not just for the country, but also for external private sector players, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=453.26s)]
*  international private sector players who are keen to invest in geothermal. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=459.9s)]
*  So Kenya provides that enabling environment. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=463.3s)]
*  So that's one key aspect. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=465.18s)]
*  Something that was also very key for Kenya was setting up a regulatory framework that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=466.86s)]
*  is friendly to the private sector. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=471.90000000000003s)]
*  So this enables the private sector to get their returns back in foreign currency, but [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=474.90000000000003s)]
*  equally it protects investor rights. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  That was a very important aspect. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=484.38s)]
*  So we got a very strong PPA framework, Power Purchase Agreement framework, that is fully [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  supported by the attorney general. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=491.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's a regulatory framework that holds water and the banking community accepts it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  So that was one very important aspect from a Kenya environment to make this geothermal [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=500.18s)]
*  field work very well for both the government and also for the private sector. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=507.18s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=511.17999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=512.18s)]
*  That's a great answer. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=513.18s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=514.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=515.18s)]
*  I think one of the first factors is, of course, the fact that Indonesia is sitting on one [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=516.18s)]
*  of the hottest spots, geologically speaking, like 40 percent of geothermal resources of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=520.7s)]
*  the world. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=528.58s)]
*  But I think natural resources alone is not enough. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=530.1s)]
*  We are rich with a lot of things. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=532.7800000000001s)]
*  We have summer around the year, but we are just about to develop solar energy and everything. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=534.9000000000001s)]
*  The same with geothermal. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  We, like Basdar mentioned, Indonesia, focus on strengthening the regulatory framework. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=544.74s)]
*  Geothermal is actually probably the only source of energy that has its own law, I think, after [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=552.26s)]
*  that nuclear safety. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=559.3399999999999s)]
*  But it's more like from a nuclear safety perspective. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=561.26s)]
*  But geothermal has its own law since 2003. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=564.42s)]
*  And this law has been improved in 2014, which, like Kenya's experience as well, balanced [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=567.38s)]
*  the rights and obligations, protects the interests of the private sectors, because energy, like [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=574.54s)]
*  any infrastructure projects, are very costly and private sector needs some security guarantee. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=582.42s)]
*  And as well, it addresses cross-sectoral issues. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=590.82s)]
*  That's why we put it at the bill level. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=594.5s)]
*  For example, when the geothermal resources are located in a conservation area. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=596.58s)]
*  So there are these aspects that are addressed by our law. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=602.78s)]
*  And the other thing is, I think I happened to be here in the previous panel, Indonesia [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=607.42s)]
*  as well, the state starts some drilling program and then shares the information to the private [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=613.02s)]
*  sectors that are interested. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=624.54s)]
*  We actually established what we call the Genesis, geothermal energy system of information, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=626.38s)]
*  which is open to private sectors that wanted to understand the geological information. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=632.82s)]
*  So based on that, they can make a decision in terms of investment and what nots. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=639.82s)]
*  And as well, the portal as well has a platform to start participating in tender. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=645.54s)]
*  And the last thing I think that is important in our experience as well, the need to have [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=653.54s)]
*  a consultation with local society. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=660.54s)]
*  And this is what Indonesia's experience being a democratic country is. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=663.3s)]
*  We have to always engage in order to ensure that any geothermal power plant can get approval [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=667.3s)]
*  from the local community and they can benefit from that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=674.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=677.74s)]
*  Great. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=678.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=679.74s)]
*  So a lot of really interesting themes from what was just said and what we've heard earlier [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=680.74s)]
*  in the day, sharing of data, regulatory frameworks, strong government signals. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=685.46s)]
*  So it's nice to have that level of continuity across the day. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=691.54s)]
*  So Sophie, if I understand correctly, Germany actively is considering a law on geothermal [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=696.78s)]
*  heat right now. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=703.1s)]
*  Can you share a little bit about that and how, if at all, any of these lessons learned from [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=704.6800000000001s)]
*  Indonesia and Kenya are being applied? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=710.26s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=712.4599999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=713.8199999999999s)]
*  So there is this bill. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=714.8199999999999s)]
*  It's a geothermal acceleration act. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=717.38s)]
*  So geothermischleunigungsgesetz, a lovely German word. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=720.5799999999999s)]
*  And the idea is, and I think that's very similar to here in the US, one of the obstacles for [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=726.18s)]
*  the geothermal and other energy sources in Germany is permitting. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=731.5799999999999s)]
*  So the idea is to make permitting much, much easier than it has been before. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=736.42s)]
*  An important part of that is that now in overriding or in this bill, the bill suggests that there [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=742.18s)]
*  is an overriding public interest when it comes to geothermal projects, which helps a lot [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=749.3399999999999s)]
*  to speed up projects. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=754.6999999999999s)]
*  There are, the bill also introduces ways to de-risk the investments and also there are [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=758.42s)]
*  programs in Germany by the KFW and Munich Re, so our investment and development bank, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=769.18s)]
*  to de-risk the exploration risk, which drives costs up when it comes to geothermal. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=776.54s)]
*  And other parts, another part very important because when you talk about geothermal and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=787.4200000000001s)]
*  other forms of energy, you need to understand a little bit the term mine when it comes to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=791.98s)]
*  things like that. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=796.3000000000001s)]
*  We are not known to be very risk friendly or as open when it comes to innovation as [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=797.74s)]
*  our Americans friends are. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=803.94s)]
*  So that's also the reason why in Germany we use mostly hydrothermal geothermal and no [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=806.0s)]
*  petrothermal ways because the idea of hydraulic stimulation is something German people are [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=813.0600000000001s)]
*  very critical of. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=822.38s)]
*  So an important part also of this bill is to find a way to de-risk mining damages, to [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=823.46s)]
*  find and that's very important if you want to have the public opinion and society to [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=832.98s)]
*  be open to something like geothermal because we are not very experienced when it comes [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=838.18s)]
*  to things like drilling. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=843.58s)]
*  It's nothing Germans are in theory very fond of, so it's very important to have this and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=846.18s)]
*  to give stability and certainty and clarity. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=853.22s)]
*  But Germany sees a lot of potential when it comes to geothermal for heating. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=857.34s)]
*  Another very important fact is that for us geothermal so far has not been very important [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=861.8199999999999s)]
*  when it comes to power production. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=866.06s)]
*  It only adds to 0.1 percent of our electricity mix and Germany is on 60 percent renewables, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=867.7399999999999s)]
*  around 60 percent renewables when it comes to electricity mix at the moment. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=875.14s)]
*  But most of our heating system is district heating 80 percent and it's combined, traditional [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=879.4599999999999s)]
*  combined heating systems. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=887.38s)]
*  And there is a huge potential for geothermal on that because Germany we have had a recent [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=889.02s)]
*  change of government and as you might know in Germany we always have coalition governments. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=894.26s)]
*  Therefore the swing between different governments is not as extreme as in other countries. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=901.62s)]
*  But one particular new approach is to be a little bit more technology open when it comes [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=907.38s)]
*  to energy topics but at the same time trying to reach our goal to be climate neutral by [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=913.78s)]
*  2045. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=920.38s)]
*  Geothermal is an important part of that especially in Germany when it comes to heating because [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=921.5799999999999s)]
*  the entire question of heating adds to a huge part or a relevant part of German emissions. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=926.9s)]
*  Thanks Sophie and just a real quick follow up for you. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=935.5799999999999s)]
*  We heard earlier I think it was Lev who mentioned that the technology that his company uses [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=939.06s)]
*  requires hydraulic fracturing and stimulation. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=946.4599999999999s)]
*  So is what you're saying about the reinsurance, does that clarify that hydraulic stimulation [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=949.2s)]
*  could be used in Germany or is it not that clear? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=955.76s)]
*  No I wouldn't go that far. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=959.24s)]
*  I think this is a little bit of a longer process. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=960.76s)]
*  That's why we are very excited that there are also new projects that don't need hydraulic [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=963.12s)]
*  stimulation and that's also something we're looking, Germany is looking into a lot. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=968.44s)]
*  So it doesn't go so far to say yes you can proactively do it but nor does it say you [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=974.84s)]
*  can't do it. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=979.64s)]
*  It kind of builds some frameworks to… [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=980.64s)]
*  No, no, no, you can't do it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=982.44s)]
*  It's just about the mining in general if there are some kind of mining damages. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=984.1600000000001s)]
*  Because I mean we do not have experience with drilling but we do have experience with coal [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=988.88s)]
*  mining. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=992.6800000000001s)]
*  So mining damages is something people are very aware of. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=993.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay cool thanks. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=997.64s)]
*  So one of the things that I get most excited about when I think of geothermal is the fact [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=999.96s)]
*  that it is a Swiss army knife which turns out doesn't have a German translation. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1005.24s)]
*  The Italian translation is a screwdriver and the Bahasa Indonesian translation is a type [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1011.44s)]
*  of broom, is that right? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1016.72s)]
*  So idioms, who knew? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1019.52s)]
*  But one of the things that I love about geothermal is its power, its clean industrial heat and [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1021.64s)]
*  its residential heating and cooling. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1028.4399999999998s)]
*  And so we've heard about the power side from our first two panelists. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1030.4399999999998s)]
*  We've heard about the residential heating and cooling. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1033.36s)]
*  Francesco, I wonder if you could speak a little bit to the clean heat side and kind of what [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  is going on at the European Commission level and kind of what your plans are there. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1039.6799999999998s)]
*  Absolutely and I think this is a perfect segue because I always like to introduce my points [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1043.4799999999998s)]
*  by giving some figures. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1048.04s)]
*  So Sophie gave like very kindly figures for Germany. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1050.0s)]
*  We have very similar figures for Europe actually because you said 0.1. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1053.88s)]
*  For Europe it's 0.2% of electricity being produced by geothermal. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1058.48s)]
*  While for heat we are around 0.7%, so a bit more. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1064.4s)]
*  And the experiences of Kenya and Indonesia are very significant in this respect because [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1069.8400000000001s)]
*  clearly they have a very power-based approach to the use of geothermal while in Europe for [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1075.88s)]
*  many years the approach has been quite towards the residential heat basically and clean heat [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1083.24s)]
*  for industry that has a new frontier. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1091.0800000000002s)]
*  Why I say that? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1093.8400000000001s)]
*  I say that because until now with the electrification push of the economy in order to have increasing [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1095.24s)]
*  amounts of renewable electricity we've seen, we've witnessed a substantial shift between [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1104.3600000000001s)]
*  let's say power production from fossil fuels into renewable energy. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1112.36s)]
*  And geothermal energy being of course part of renewable energy and it's been like that. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1115.92s)]
*  So it's nothing new for the European regulatory framework. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1121.44s)]
*  We already had geothermal energy as part of the first renewables directive already in the years 2000. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1125.04s)]
*  So in 2008 I think or 2007 and then again in the second renewable directive. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1130.68s)]
*  Now we are the third renewables directive. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1135.84s)]
*  So let's say nothing really new there. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1137.8799999999999s)]
*  So you might wonder why didn't we push more for electricity? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1140.04s)]
*  Because the European Union geography is a very poor geography under many respects, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1144.64s)]
*  but it's very rich in terms of like solar and wind. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1152.72s)]
*  So let's say we saw that solar wind could cover the more let's say immediate electrification needs [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1155.6s)]
*  in the last five to ten years. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1164.04s)]
*  But now we need to do more for heating and cooling. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1166.4s)]
*  OK, so we're working now under the leadership of the new Commissioner for Energy, Dan Jorgensen. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1170.4s)]
*  We're working on a heating and cooling strategy that will find the light of the day, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1177.52s)]
*  most likely at the end of this year already or at the beginning of next year. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1181.5600000000002s)]
*  But the important passage here is that the heating and cooling strategy is based politically [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1185.88s)]
*  and policy wise on the Affordable Energy Action Plan. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1192.0s)]
*  That was my Commissioner's first political communication. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1197.0s)]
*  There he said we have to tackle the heating and cooling sector, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1201.68s)]
*  not only because it's something that is part of an affordable energy strategy, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1208.32s)]
*  but also because it's key more than ever for decarbonisation. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  Why is it key? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1217.52s)]
*  It's key because Europe consumes half of its energy. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1218.36s)]
*  Well, heating and cooling represents half of Europe's energy consumption, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1223.3999999999999s)]
*  which is way more than many other jurisdictions. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1228.48s)]
*  Why? We have very cold winters in the north and we have very, very warm summers in the south. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1230.9199999999998s)]
*  So we have to let's say now it's become the heating and cooling sector has become the really low hanging fruit [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1238.48s)]
*  for our policy. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1246.84s)]
*  So what do we have there? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1248.56s)]
*  Our European Geothermal Energy Council, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1250.8799999999999s)]
*  who is like the main lobby, if you want, in Europe that advocates for the development of renewable energy, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1254.96s)]
*  has been very successful in putting at the centre of the debate in Europe geothermal energy [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  as a solution for not only heat, but also power. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1269.0s)]
*  So what we've seen now is that we already have around 400 district heating and cooling systems [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1271.24s)]
*  out of 5,000 in Europe that run on geothermal energy. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1279.28s)]
*  So we're getting to almost 10% and we intend to more than double that figure. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1283.32s)]
*  We see that the new technologies, Sophie mentioned some of them, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1290.4s)]
*  can actually help in having a combined heat and power cycles. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1297.6s)]
*  So in order to find synergies between heat and power generation, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1301.2s)]
*  we are looking into that in order to find the right visibility signals at policy level. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1306.04s)]
*  And of course the financing side. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1312.84s)]
*  While we will include in our heating and cooling strategy possible strategies to have, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1315.48s)]
*  let's say de-risking from the public level, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1322.48s)]
*  we are already engaged with private financial institutions [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1326.56s)]
*  in order to have private capital flocking once we are there [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1330.76s)]
*  and we are serious about the policy signals that we give at regulatory level. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1334.84s)]
*  Thanks Francesco, that's really awesome. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1339.52s)]
*  And nice to hear the de-risking in both your answer and in Sophie's answer, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1341.44s)]
*  building on what you guys were saying earlier, so that's really nice. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1345.8799999999999s)]
*  But is there a specific focus or any thinking that's happening within the Commission [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1349.08s)]
*  on direct use industrial heat and decarbonising that stuff [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1354.72s)]
*  or is it just focused on residential heating and cooling? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1359.0800000000002s)]
*  No, absolutely. Within the heating and cooling strategy, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1361.64s)]
*  there will be also direct heat use for industry, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1363.96s)]
*  which is already by the way part of the Net Zero Industry Act. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1367.16s)]
*  So thank you, Drew, for drawing my attention to that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1371.44s)]
*  I forgot to mention it. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1374.4s)]
*  So in the wake of the Russian aggression of Ukraine [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1375.5600000000002s)]
*  and let's say as part of the effort to diversify away from our main, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1381.6s)]
*  let's say, processing jurisdiction in terms of raw materials, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1389.04s)]
*  the Commission, one of the very last acts of the previous Commission, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1393.6799999999998s)]
*  we still have the same President, but her first term, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1397.04s)]
*  she really pushed a lot on having a strong component of industrial policy. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1402.4399999999998s)]
*  Then it started with the Net Zero Industry Act, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1407.6s)]
*  whereby certain technologies were considered strategic [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1410.32s)]
*  in order to have more affordable energy to industry, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1414.48s)]
*  one of them being geothermal energy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1418.24s)]
*  So let's say we start seeing the different policies converging. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1420.1599999999999s)]
*  It's not just energy policy, it's not just climate policy, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1426.24s)]
*  it's not just industrial policy, it's not just security policy. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1429.52s)]
*  It's a bit of all of this. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1433.76s)]
*  Geothermal is a screwdriver. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1436.72s)]
*  Absolutely. Geothermal is a screwdriver. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1438.0s)]
*  I can mention another screwdriver, nuclear energy. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1440.56s)]
*  That is another very, at least here in the US, very bipartisan. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1442.8s)]
*  So another perfect angle to cooperate more with the US. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1446.72s)]
*  And if you allow me, like last point, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1450.6s)]
*  the crucial part of this discussion, since we are here, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1452.8s)]
*  is about transatlantic cooperation and the way we can really find [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1456.08s)]
*  like some items that are so good to discuss and so good to progress on. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1460.96s)]
*  And one of them being geothermal energy. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1467.6s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's great. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1469.6399999999999s)]
*  I was actually going to ask that later, but since we're on topic, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1471.48s)]
*  I'd like to invite each of you just to give a really brief remark on [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1475.12s)]
*  how do you see your country working with the United States on geothermal? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1479.32s)]
*  Is that an avenue of cooperation? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1485.12s)]
*  And specifically, because I think there's going to be a lot of interest [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1487.6s)]
*  on this particular question. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1489.84s)]
*  Is there a scope of work, not a scope of work, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1491.44s)]
*  but is there the ability to bring in [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1494.24s)]
*  any American companies, oil and gas know-how, et cetera, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1497.56s)]
*  probably less so for Kenya and Indonesia than it might be for Europe? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1501.9599999999998s)]
*  But do you feel like within that answer, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1505.48s)]
*  what does it look like to cooperate specifically on getting projects [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1508.6799999999998s)]
*  in the ground in your country? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1512.32s)]
*  Well, thank you. I'll start first on this. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1514.9599999999998s)]
*  I think there's a lot of cooperation and synergies that can be built. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1517.3999999999999s)]
*  The first thing is like you look at the financial institutions. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1521.0s)]
*  Start with the DFC. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1524.16s)]
*  DFC is looking to scale up big time investment to American corporations [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1525.6000000000001s)]
*  to invest in Africa. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1530.5200000000002s)]
*  So geothermal is a good area that [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1532.44s)]
*  US investors can come in and tap into. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1536.5200000000002s)]
*  One of the biggest aspects is [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1539.5200000000002s)]
*  what investors look for is returns, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1542.72s)]
*  risks and also the risks that they're taking towards these projects. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1545.48s)]
*  A lot of these projects, similar to what my colleague [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1549.5200000000002s)]
*  from Indonesia talked about, risks have to be balanced between [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1552.84s)]
*  the opportunities that investors get and also [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  between the private and the public sector. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1561.6799999999998s)]
*  So Kenya has developed a very strong PPP act [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1564.56s)]
*  that protects both the public and the private sector. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1568.24s)]
*  Well, the energy space, especially in Kenya, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1572.52s)]
*  has well been developed over very many, from very many years. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1576.1999999999998s)]
*  And this has enabled, has created an environment whereby [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1580.1200000000001s)]
*  risks and returns are well balanced, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1584.24s)]
*  which makes it much easier for investors. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1586.96s)]
*  So we see this as a huge opportunity to partner with US companies. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1589.08s)]
*  And Kenya is open for that, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1592.88s)]
*  to bring in strong US companies keen to this. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1595.16s)]
*  And the best part about markets like Kenya, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1598.44s)]
*  capital markets are available. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1601.08s)]
*  What do you call private commercial banks are available. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1604.56s)]
*  And there's a lot of DFI's that are available to come in and put in [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1607.2s)]
*  long term money into some of these big infrastructure projects. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1611.6000000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, thank you. Thanks. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1615.44s)]
*  Thank you. Before I answer the question, I think I want to pick up [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1617.88s)]
*  because it will relate to your question on direct use, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1621.3600000000001s)]
*  because there's something that we are trying to develop as well [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1624.8s)]
*  in terms of our use of geothermal energy. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1629.4s)]
*  Of course, not for heating, because we have summer all around here. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1632.24s)]
*  Just a little bit dry, a little bit wet. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1635.4799999999998s)]
*  But I mean, cooling is actually something that I learned. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1640.04s)]
*  Maybe this is something that we have to be talking about. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1642.2399999999998s)]
*  We really need that. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1645.6399999999999s)]
*  Especially when during this time of the year. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1647.12s)]
*  But what we are doing now, we are engaging on application of [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1650.4399999999998s)]
*  direct use of geothermal energy for agro industry. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1654.6799999999998s)]
*  For example, we use it to dry our coffee, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1659.08s)]
*  which is if you use the normal daylight drying process, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1663.68s)]
*  it will take one month. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1669.04s)]
*  And then with geothermal, it's just one week. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1670.1599999999999s)]
*  And then the coffee will be on your table. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1672.36s)]
*  So I mean, like this agro industry and then critical mineral as well [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1674.68s)]
*  that we are looking into where we can extract from this geothermal process. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1678.56s)]
*  Critical mineral that will be used and will have added value [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1684.84s)]
*  of a strategic value, not only for energy, not only for [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1689.0s)]
*  agro industry, but even like electronic vehicle batteries [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1692.76s)]
*  making and whatnot. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1696.1999999999998s)]
*  So I think these are the areas that are very interesting that [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1697.6399999999999s)]
*  to develop on direct use of geothermal technology. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1702.24s)]
*  And why I say this is a potential, because we now use like 94 percent [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1706.36s)]
*  up to 98 percent of our technology is high temperature [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1713.8799999999999s)]
*  geothermal system. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1718.0s)]
*  While actually our geothermal site is 71 percent is low to medium [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1719.56s)]
*  and the geothermal system. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1725.76s)]
*  So and we need to learn from the US on that, because US, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1729.8s)]
*  I think, if I'm not mistaken, my colleague from Indonesian Department Energy [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1734.08s)]
*  has like 40 years experience, correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1738.8s)]
*  and have like 33 percent of their system is using that [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1742.08s)]
*  low to middle temperature geothermal system. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1746.76s)]
*  So I think from that perspective alone, we can see a technical cooperation. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1750.76s)]
*  And Ambassador has mentioned the other thing that we can work together [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1756.96s)]
*  as well is financing. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1760.8s)]
*  Of course, geothermal and any infrastructure project is very expensive. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1762.72s)]
*  We want to work with USDFC. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1767.8799999999999s)]
*  And Indonesia has just established our own sovereign wealth fund [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1771.6s)]
*  managing about 900 billion US dollars assets [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1776.84s)]
*  and which can be used for strategic investment. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1780.2s)]
*  And they are interested as well to explore co-investment, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1783.92s)]
*  co-financing in those projects. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1786.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think this is an area that we have overlapping interest, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1790.16s)]
*  both at policy level and technological complementarity as well. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1793.28s)]
*  And last but not the least, I think [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1797.6s)]
*  what is interesting from the current US administration is [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1800.16s)]
*  it's a challenging one, it's a new one, but at the same time, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  it brings opportunity. We live like that. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1808.5600000000002s)]
*  We live in a ring of fire. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1811.3200000000002s)]
*  We have to come with earthquakes, volcano, but it comes with geothermal too. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1814.24s)]
*  So we see that. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1819.72s)]
*  And in our discussion with many [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1822.16s)]
*  section, many agencies of the current administration, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1825.16s)]
*  there's interest to sort of enhance and strengthen [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1828.0800000000002s)]
*  partnership through from the lens of supply chain. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1833.52s)]
*  So not strictly from the lens of import or export [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1837.96s)]
*  or just transfer, but mutually beneficial. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1844.16s)]
*  And I think this is where the discussion with the US would go, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1847.44s)]
*  that you see this as a mutually beneficial, that having, for example, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1852.0s)]
*  importing US technologies in Asia, bringing US fund along with the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1858.0s)]
*  know-how will benefit in Asia, but at the same time will benefit the US as well. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1864.0800000000002s)]
*  So and I think that is that is the way we try to frame our cooperation [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1868.88s)]
*  with the US, not only in geothermal area, but in other other parts [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1874.16s)]
*  of our cooperation potential. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1878.48s)]
*  And last but not least, I think the more from the [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1881.68s)]
*  geopolitical perspective, I think having for Indonesia, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1886.44s)]
*  having more connectivity, having more alternative to supply chain [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1890.88s)]
*  is better for us. We don't want we never want to be [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1895.52s)]
*  relying on just one or two partners. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1900.16s)]
*  We want to be working with as many partners as possible. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1903.68s)]
*  And and then so that will help secure our own energy supply towards [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1907.8s)]
*  we have ambition to grow by eight percent in twenty twenty nine. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1913.2s)]
*  So we need to work together. Yeah. Thank you. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate it. Francesco. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1921.0s)]
*  Yes. Probably just two examples of current and potential cooperation [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1922.64s)]
*  and one another. So and what's already happening, for example, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1928.44s)]
*  like in a in a in a big project in Utah, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1934.3200000000002s)]
*  Faragos, if I'm not wrong, the name is what's happening there [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1938.24s)]
*  is that the main equipment that is being used to actually go ahead [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1943.96s)]
*  with the project is Italian machinery. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1948.76s)]
*  So something is already happening. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1951.8400000000001s)]
*  We already we already have an existing marketplace there [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1954.4s)]
*  where US projects developers can rely on reliable partners [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1958.8s)]
*  on the other side of the Atlantic and a potential part of cooperation [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1965.8s)]
*  that I really love to explore more is all the good talks [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1970.8s)]
*  that the oil and gas industry here in the US has given me. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1975.84s)]
*  Like I learned so much in the last year and a half in understanding that [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1979.52s)]
*  what when I came here, I had the idea that fracking was something [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1983.44s)]
*  that is like a sort of like anathema. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1986.6799999999998s)]
*  OK, because in Europe, that's where our let's say skin reaction to that is [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1988.8s)]
*  this is not something that we will never allow. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1995.9199999999998s)]
*  What I learned in the last year and a half is that there is striking and fracking. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=1998.52s)]
*  There is so much more advanced technology that can be deployed now [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2003.0s)]
*  in a way less intrusive way. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2006.44s)]
*  So I would I would be very happy to have American companies [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2009.08s)]
*  that develop this technology. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2013.28s)]
*  I mean, the current secretary of energy is there and is one of the biggest [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2014.52s)]
*  innovators in technology, in technological advancement, in hydraulic fracking. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2019.24s)]
*  So the European American companies should come to Europe and explain [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2025.0800000000002s)]
*  why the new systems, the new technologies are effectively, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2030.5200000000002s)]
*  let's say, mitigating any concern that we could have in Europe. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2035.92s)]
*  And there there is a huge potential for a market for American companies. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2039.8000000000002s)]
*  Last point, an antidote. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2043.64s)]
*  A couple of months ago, in the context of our transatlantic [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2045.6000000000001s)]
*  sustainable transition initiative that we managed at [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2049.04s)]
*  the DC level, at the EU delegation level, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2052.6000000000004s)]
*  we are engaging subnational diplomacy, OK, especially in the climate area. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2055.84s)]
*  Of course, the federal level right now is a bit more difficult to engage with. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2059.96s)]
*  So we are going at the level down. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2064.32s)]
*  We we spoke to states, we talked to counties and municipalities and so on. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2066.2000000000003s)]
*  I was in New Mexico. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2071.1600000000003s)]
*  I was in New Mexico and I was supposed to talk to the governor's office [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2072.56s)]
*  on several things and so on. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2076.4s)]
*  And one of the meetings that in that beautiful state happened [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2077.8s)]
*  and was completely impromptu was with the president [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2080.88s)]
*  of the geothermal association, the local geothermal association. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2087.12s)]
*  I learned so much. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2090.56s)]
*  And he was telling me of how much of need there is in New Mexico [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2091.92s)]
*  for whatever technology. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of like leading technology is European [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2099.52s)]
*  on the entire lifecycle of the project or a geothermal project [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2103.88s)]
*  for European companies to be interested in going [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2109.64s)]
*  to New Mexico and find out opportunities there. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2113.12s)]
*  And that's what's happening on the ground. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2115.68s)]
*  So let's say it's not something that is abstract, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2117.2s)]
*  you know, something that is just like a political level happening in [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2120.4799999999996s)]
*  enclosed doors with like a lot of smoke. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2123.9199999999996s)]
*  And no, it's it's something that is happening on the ground. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2126.52s)]
*  And yeah, and we need to favor this. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2129.7599999999998s)]
*  No, it's an excellent point. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2132.0s)]
*  And just real briefly, before I turn to you, Sophie, to answer the question, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2133.52s)]
*  you know, I don't think it's lost on many people in this room [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2137.36s)]
*  that a lot of the turbines that are supplied for US power projects [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2140.4s)]
*  are manufactured in Italy. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2145.28s)]
*  And I think, you know, particularly given the legislation that recently passed [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2147.68s)]
*  and the fact that it has foreign content questions around it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2151.52s)]
*  I don't I don't know if anyone fully has wrapped their head around [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2155.32s)]
*  what that actually means. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2157.68s)]
*  But maybe that's [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2159.84s)]
*  that that's something coming out of this conference is we need to figure that out. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2162.52s)]
*  But, you know, last I checked, Italy counts as one of the good guys. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2166.12s)]
*  Entities of foreign concern. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2171.4s)]
*  Right. Right. Exactly. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2172.8s)]
*  And Italy is not on that list. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2173.92s)]
*  So let's let's let's take advantage of that. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2175.08s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2177.36s)]
*  And and just real briefly on New Mexico, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2179.56s)]
*  just a couple of weeks ago, my organization, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2183.36s)]
*  along with New Mexico Tech University and the Mexico Geological Society, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2186.04s)]
*  published a paper looking at the vast potential of geothermal in New Mexico. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2189.52s)]
*  And we're working on similar reports in Indonesia and maybe soon [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2194.64s)]
*  in Africa as well, by the way. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2197.92s)]
*  But one of the findings of that report is that there's few US states [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2199.88s)]
*  that have the trifecta of oil and gas know how hydrothermal know how [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2203.3599999999997s)]
*  political will and heat. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2208.6s)]
*  And so it's interesting that you chose New Mexico for your anecdote [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2210.8399999999997s)]
*  because it kind of all comes together there. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2213.08s)]
*  Sophie, transatlantic relations. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2215.44s)]
*  Yeah. So we have very good experience on a policy level [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2217.16s)]
*  with energy partnership with the United States, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2220.88s)]
*  as we have with many other countries. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2223.12s)]
*  And I see no reason why that shouldn't continue. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2225.12s)]
*  And geothermal could be part of this discussion [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2228.96s)]
*  because I think there are many areas where we can learn from each other, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2232.12s)]
*  as I've mentioned before, permitting or standardization [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  or many other areas on a policy level. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2239.04s)]
*  When it comes to market opportunities in the private sectors, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2243.3599999999997s)]
*  as Francesco has said, I've also traveled a little bit [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2246.0s)]
*  through the different states and wherever I go [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2250.52s)]
*  to try to find out if there's room for subnational cooperation. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2252.44s)]
*  I either see German companies already investing in the United States heavily [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2255.44s)]
*  on general, not geothermal particularly, or American companies [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2260.84s)]
*  importing German parts or technology for their work. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2265.36s)]
*  And I think that's also true for geothermal. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2270.32s)]
*  It could be true. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2273.36s)]
*  And just to give you like a little bit of idea what what [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2274.04s)]
*  what the scale is, when I mean there is potential in Germany at the moment, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2277.56s)]
*  Germany operates 31 [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2280.36s)]
*  deep geothermal plants for heating, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2284.48s)]
*  nine for combined and two for energy production. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2287.8s)]
*  Sixteen are under construction. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2291.0800000000004s)]
*  So this would always add 50 percent to the 31 we've already had. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2293.44s)]
*  And 158 are on a planning stage. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2297.52s)]
*  Can you just go through those numbers one more time? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2301.88s)]
*  So 31 are. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2303.84s)]
*  So we are operating 31 for heating. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2307.92s)]
*  Nine combined and two only for electricity. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2311.1200000000003s)]
*  Sixteen are under construction and 158 are planned. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2315.2000000000003s)]
*  Geothermal. Yes, for heating. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2319.28s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. Or in total. Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2320.88s)]
*  Yeah. Thank you. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2323.0800000000004s)]
*  So there is a potential for cooperation and investment. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2324.8s)]
*  Yeah. Lots of potential. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2327.76s)]
*  One of the amazing things about being at this conference is there is a list of [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2330.92s)]
*  nine really fantastic questions here in front of me. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2335.84s)]
*  So kudos to the audience for really having some awesome questions here. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2338.56s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to get to all of them, but there are a lot of really [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2342.68s)]
*  fantastic ones. Sophie, let's stick with you. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2344.84s)]
*  Munich and Bavaria have become geothermal innovation hubs, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2347.64s)]
*  which I did not know. But that's awesome. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2351.72s)]
*  What lessons can be transferred to other parts of Europe or globally? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  So what I assume is meant by Munich is Gerrit's read close to Munich, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2358.12s)]
*  not as nice as the city is probably as nice as Munich, but the name is not as nice. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2362.88s)]
*  Maybe it's a huge project. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2367.16s)]
*  And as mentioned before, that's a very unique project for us [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2370.3999999999996s)]
*  because it doesn't include any hydraulic stimulation. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2375.04s)]
*  There is. So the the model, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2378.04s)]
*  I have to say, predicts that there could be 64 megawatt for heating [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2382.3999999999996s)]
*  and eight megawatt for for electricity. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2386.44s)]
*  So this is quite big. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2389.08s)]
*  And the same company is already [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2391.6s)]
*  planning two other sites in Germany and in Gerrit's read. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2394.2s)]
*  It's everything goes by plan. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2398.6s)]
*  They're supposed to produce the first electricity or to to add [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2401.7599999999998s)]
*  the first electricity to the grid on the last [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2406.56s)]
*  last half of this year. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2411.3599999999997s)]
*  This being said, it is an international project. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2414.8399999999997s)]
*  There is a lot of international investment. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2417.3599999999997s)]
*  There is a lot of public money. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2418.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a 400 million euro project. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2419.92s)]
*  That's why there's, of course, also, as I mentioned before, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2423.36s)]
*  germs like certainty and continuity. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2426.44s)]
*  And we have a little bit of show me mentality. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2430.4s)]
*  So prove it to me. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2433.28s)]
*  And there are some skeptical voices as well who say if this would fail, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2435.28s)]
*  of course, that would have a negative impact on the entire geothermal topic [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2441.1600000000003s)]
*  in Germany. But so far, it looks really good. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2446.0800000000004s)]
*  And we're very excited about this project. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2449.88s)]
*  Thank you. And I won't tell people about Munich, about what you just said. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2452.16s)]
*  But I used to live in Munich. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2456.24s)]
*  So I'm biased. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2457.4s)]
*  All right. Another great question here. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2459.92s)]
*  And this is for you, Ambassador. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2461.3599999999997s)]
*  How does Kenya balance public utility involvement like Kenjin and GDC subsidiary [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2463.12s)]
*  with private investment in geothermal? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2468.04s)]
*  And then I'm going to tack on and add on to that, which is [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2470.52s)]
*  there's been some talk of using geothermal for data centers in Kenya. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2474.4s)]
*  And how does that feed into the conversation? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2478.72s)]
*  Thank you. A very good question. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2482.16s)]
*  We've asked that question. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2483.68s)]
*  First number one, Kenya has split all the utilities, for example, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2484.88s)]
*  the distribution, the transmission, the generation. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2491.12s)]
*  And generation is driven by both part of the Kenjin. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2496.7599999999998s)]
*  Kenjin is a listed company in Kenya. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2501.2s)]
*  So they do and bid for projects similar to with private sector. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2505.64s)]
*  Yeah. So they actually have to compete to win projects. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2509.56s)]
*  So Kenya has made it a level playing field for both the public [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2513.36s)]
*  and private sector to participate in these projects. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2516.84s)]
*  And we're talking about, for example, with geothermal, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2520.2799999999997s)]
*  technologies are constantly changing. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2522.96s)]
*  And the people with a [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2525.68s)]
*  with much more advanced technology, they're able to deliver plants [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2528.08s)]
*  at a much cheaper price. Yeah. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2532.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's not always the case. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2534.4s)]
*  The private public sector is able to compete [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2536.56s)]
*  with large international companies. Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2539.68s)]
*  So we've created a mechanism where they compete evenly. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2542.2000000000003s)]
*  But one thing I'll say is with our experience, especially in geothermal, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2546.84s)]
*  Kenjin, Kenjin has been able to export [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2551.48s)]
*  its expertise to multiple countries around us. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2555.0s)]
*  Yeah. Actually, Ethiopia [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2558.88s)]
*  has recruited Kenjin for the exploration. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2561.68s)]
*  Yeah. So we're looking to scale up our expertise [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2566.1200000000003s)]
*  and leverage what we've built across Africa. Yeah. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2569.6000000000004s)]
*  Secondly, in terms of GDC, GDC will continue with its mandate. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2575.48s)]
*  GDC is 100 percent owned by government. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2579.84s)]
*  The mandate to explore [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2583.6400000000003s)]
*  it's an exploration company. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2586.76s)]
*  They'll continue with their mandate. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2588.2400000000002s)]
*  However, this is a statistic that's not highly talked about. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2589.6800000000003s)]
*  Majority of the exploration currently in Kenya is actually now being led [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2594.48s)]
*  by the private sector. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2598.44s)]
*  In the past, it was fully led by Kenjin. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2600.28s)]
*  Yeah. As we speak right now, we've got 14 private companies [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2603.48s)]
*  that are doing geothermal exploration. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2606.8s)]
*  Yeah. And these are from everywhere in the world. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2609.36s)]
*  It's not just. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2611.16s)]
*  Oh, so we talked about the previous questions. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2612.6s)]
*  Is Kenya looking to partner up with the U.S.? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2616.8s)]
*  We are open for business. Yeah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2619.08s)]
*  Your last question is about the data centers. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2621.72s)]
*  There's nothing more sweet to develop a data center [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2625.7599999999998s)]
*  than a green data center. Yeah. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2629.72s)]
*  So now, geothermal is a very good source of green power. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2633.2s)]
*  So Kenya right now, when you look at, there's an area called Nidhubasha. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2637.64s)]
*  We're looking to scale up data center development. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2643.0s)]
*  Yeah. Already, we've got companies like Google [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2646.44s)]
*  that is looking to do it. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2649.84s)]
*  Actually, Google and Microsoft are looking to develop data centers. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2651.2400000000002s)]
*  And we're looking at data centers for AI. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2654.6400000000003s)]
*  We're able to build large power plants [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2659.08s)]
*  that are directly captive power plants for these data centers. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2661.84s)]
*  So that's a key area of focus. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2666.0s)]
*  And is anyone keen on investing on that? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2667.7200000000003s)]
*  Please reach out. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2670.76s)]
*  We'll connect you to the right people within the institutions in Kenya. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2672.48s)]
*  Thanks. Thanks, Ambassador. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2676.84s)]
*  And we we have a tool that we developed. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2678.88s)]
*  That's basically the Google Maps of subsurface heat. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2683.32s)]
*  And a couple of months ago, we put out a module looking at [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2686.8s)]
*  where the best places globally to do geothermal data centers. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2690.52s)]
*  And not surprisingly, that part of Kenya ranked very highly. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2693.72s)]
*  So the data backs up with what you're saying. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2697.28s)]
*  So we need to work much closer [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2700.88s)]
*  so that we can bring in more investors into Kenya. All right. Thank you. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2702.44s)]
*  Ibrani, I think we've got time for a couple more questions. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2706.64s)]
*  This might be your last question. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2709.36s)]
*  How is the Indonesian government working to attract foreign direct investment [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2712.12s)]
*  into geothermal while ensuring local content and benefit? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2715.36s)]
*  Yes. So first of all, I think [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2719.32s)]
*  in terms of attracting investment, of course, I forgot to add that [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2722.96s)]
*  in terms of geothermal, we as well provide work together with World Bank [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2726.8s)]
*  to provide the risking fund in terms of covering the [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2731.88s)]
*  the cost or risk associated with exploration and production drilling. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2736.56s)]
*  And the question about the local content requirement [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2741.92s)]
*  is something that has been going around [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2745.12s)]
*  not only in the geothermal sector, but as well in others. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2747.4s)]
*  Actually, in our conversation with partners, we actually have [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2750.52s)]
*  tried to solve and able to solve a lot of these questions [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2756.4s)]
*  because we we are able to sort of be flexible in terms of what we call local. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2761.0s)]
*  And it can be translated into different ways, into sometimes, for example, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2769.88s)]
*  development of human resources like we did with Apple, we did with GE Health. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2775.48s)]
*  So I think moving forward, we are and always ready to be flexible on that. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2781.48s)]
*  And the other thing is that we are in the process of liberalisation ourselves. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2787.2400000000002s)]
*  We just signed our accession to the OECD. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2794.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think you can expect that with that accession, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2798.48s)]
*  Indonesia is going to even more aggressive, more ambitious in reforming [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2801.2000000000003s)]
*  our regulatory situation, regulatory framework, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2805.76s)]
*  including in our discussion with US governments. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2810.88s)]
*  And I think this is where the government to government talks is important, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2815.0s)]
*  to provide a framework that is acceptable not only for the governments, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2819.8s)]
*  but as well for the private business entities of both sides. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2824.4s)]
*  And I think we have done, have been involved in previous cases [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2828.7200000000003s)]
*  where we can solve those problems. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2834.0s)]
*  We have regulations, but the regulations always have a sort of maybe like swiss knife [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2836.32s)]
*  that you can go around and you can just create something [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2843.48s)]
*  in order to deliver a strategic interest together. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2846.36s)]
*  I think this is where we can guarantee we are open for business, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2849.68s)]
*  we are ready to invite to work with US companies on this issue. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2853.2400000000002s)]
*  Great, thank you, Yobani. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2857.4s)]
*  Francesco, we've got three minutes left. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2859.32s)]
*  I want to give everyone a chance just to answer a one word question. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2860.84s)]
*  But before I do that, can you just briefly talk about the EU innovation [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2864.0s)]
*  in the newer emerging states and through kind of what's happening, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2870.52s)]
*  a lot of the Eastern European countries have some of the highest geothermal potential. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2873.88s)]
*  Are there funding mechanisms, are there strategies focused on bringing more geothermal there? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2878.08s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. Good question. Thank you. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2882.04s)]
*  Yes, so our joint research centre, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2885.52s)]
*  which is an integral part of the European Commission, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2888.52s)]
*  has calculated that across the entire EU territory, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2892.2400000000002s)]
*  around 25% of district heating could be covered entirely by geothermal energy. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2896.96s)]
*  This percentage goes up in Eastern Europe. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2903.52s)]
*  And it's a fortunate coincidence in the sense that already Eastern Europe [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2906.7200000000003s)]
*  has all the infrastructure in terms of district heating systems [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2910.92s)]
*  that can already be converted to geothermal energy exploitation. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2916.16s)]
*  So that's already a very good point. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2921.08s)]
*  The point of financing is key to us. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2923.2000000000003s)]
*  So geothermal energy being part of the renewables directive [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2925.48s)]
*  is already granted that all the firepower of not only the European Investment Bank, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2930.12s)]
*  but all the innovation funds, Horizon Europe, all the research-based funds [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2935.96s)]
*  and the climate funding that is channeled through European financial institutions [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2940.88s)]
*  can go 100% to cover not only topics, but in certain cases also topics of this system. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2949.08s)]
*  So in an ideal world, there will be no need for any public euros going into it [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2956.88s)]
*  because we're not talking about a technology that has not been there for a long time. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2966.6400000000003s)]
*  It's been there. We know that it has to be pushed. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2970.84s)]
*  So we will do that through a policy signal in the first place, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2973.52s)]
*  through our heating and cooling strategy. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2977.88s)]
*  And there we identify already a mechanism, financial mechanism, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2979.6400000000003s)]
*  for the private sector to invest in it because we know that we cannot... [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2984.08s)]
*  There are other areas where nascent markets need more public support. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2989.6800000000003s)]
*  This is not one of those because there is already out there technology. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2994.6400000000003s)]
*  American companies can convince us that they have to enter the market [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=2999.28s)]
*  because they have the best technology in that. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3002.36s)]
*  And we're open for business as well, as the ambassador said. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3004.2s)]
*  We're also open for business from that perspective. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3007.8799999999997s)]
*  But really, the involvement of the private sector is key. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3010.04s)]
*  And we are doing that not only by the Rio Mos Directive and the European Investment Bank, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3013.3199999999997s)]
*  but also by a taxonomy. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3018.44s)]
*  And that's just a reference for now, but happy to develop. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3019.6s)]
*  Great. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3022.96s)]
*  Well, I just got the we're out of time notice here. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3024.0s)]
*  But so I'm going to wrap up. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3027.2s)]
*  But I'll just note that if we do this ever again, Milo, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3029.08s)]
*  this international panel should be titled Open for Business [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3033.44s)]
*  because that certainly seems to be the emerging theme. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3037.36s)]
*  So I hope all of the entrepreneurs and startups in the room are paying attention to that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3040.32s)]
*  And if this were normal circumstances, I would take the moderator's privilege [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3047.0s)]
*  and just ask one more lightning round. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3052.64s)]
*  But because IEA is next and they're going to talk about their amazing report, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3054.04s)]
*  I'm going to not take that privilege and give the time to Becky. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3058.4s)]
*  But just want to thank you all for taking the time to talk about geothermal. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3062.64s)]
*  And I hope you guys were as blown away by this panel as I was [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3066.16s)]
*  because there's a lot of interest, there's a lot of enthusiasm. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3069.7599999999998s)]
*  And now it's time to make it happen. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3072.96s)]
*  So thank you all for participating. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3075.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3076.64s)]
*  I'll just project we're thrilled to have closing remarks from Rebecca Schultz, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3091.16s)]
*  the International Energy Agency Senior Counsel and Geothermal Lead [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3097.3199999999997s)]
*  to think of no better way than to round off a conference about [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3102.84s)]
*  about the importance of unlocking global geothermal power than hearing from Rebecca. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3110.2000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. The floor is yours. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3117.0s)]
*  Thanks, Milo. And can you hear me OK? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3125.52s)]
*  Otherwise, we can perhaps do it this way. Yeah, let's do it this way. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3132.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to apologize to Drew because I'm not going to give us an overview [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3136.6000000000004s)]
*  of the future of geothermal energy report. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3140.0800000000004s)]
*  I highly encourage everyone to to take a look at it. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3142.1600000000003s)]
*  What I'm going to do first, though, is congratulate the team here at Carnegie Endowment. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3145.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, truly, this has been an amazing event. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3149.8s)]
*  Thank you for your hospitality, for organizing this. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3152.5600000000004s)]
*  And also congratulations on what is really an incredible report. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3155.84s)]
*  So thank you all. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3159.1200000000003s)]
*  What I'm going to do instead of stepping through the future of geothermal energy report in more detail, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3163.0800000000004s)]
*  I wanted actually to to step us back through the course of the last five and a half hours or so [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3168.2000000000003s)]
*  and capture at least some of the learnings that that I heard. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3173.8s)]
*  I also realize that I'm standing in between us and a cocktail reception. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3177.48s)]
*  And so this is a very dangerous time and place to be in. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3181.5600000000004s)]
*  My key learning and takeaway out of out of all of this. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3186.4s)]
*  And there are so many from the entire room today is really how much we're learning from from one another, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3189.7200000000003s)]
*  and especially in the U.S. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3194.96s)]
*  Look between the national labs and ARPA-E, back to companies, back to the geothermal technologies office. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3196.6800000000003s)]
*  Amazing work to project inner space that's really been driving a lot of this work over the last few years as well, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3203.56s)]
*  you know, to the IA. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3210.76s)]
*  A lot of the work we're doing is because project inner space, you know, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3212.08s)]
*  asked the IA to do work several years ago and we had the opportunity to do that. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3214.88s)]
*  Over to Carnegie Endowment, you know, back over to the Clean Air Task Force. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3218.16s)]
*  Everyone is just building on top of each other and the pace of learnings of innovation that's happening in the fields, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3221.7599999999998s)]
*  and especially in the U.S., thanks in large part to to Director Boyd and what her team has been doing [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3228.64s)]
*  and the evolutions that we've seen at at Forge and in Utah. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3233.92s)]
*  And really stepping through perhaps our first panel, which was the the next American drilling revolution. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3239.7599999999998s)]
*  So my key takeaways, and we'll have a few around the room. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3246.52s)]
*  This is not your grandmother's geothermal or your grandfather's geothermal. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3249.7200000000003s)]
*  So the resource potential that we have for geothermal globally at drilling depths [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3253.92s)]
*  that are very similar to what we already drill with oil and gas wells is about 300 terawatt hours. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3258.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's about 60 times the level of global electricity used today. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3264.52s)]
*  If you go down another kilometer, down to eight kilometers, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3269.7200000000003s)]
*  that doubles to 600. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3273.12s)]
*  And so it is really a tremendous resource that we have literally sitting right beneath our feet. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3274.92s)]
*  And a lot of that work has also been supported by, you know, work from Project Inner Space [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3282.72s)]
*  and again from each other and the Geothermal Technologies Office. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3287.52s)]
*  There is, you know, as we heard from our companies that were on stage earlier today, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3291.12s)]
*  there is actually quite a lot of capital. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3296.32s)]
*  And as Director Boyd was showing earlier today, there's a lot of capital available for early stage. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3298.9199999999996s)]
*  One of the challenges we need though is how do we get that over that hump [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3304.3199999999997s)]
*  when it comes to say a Series B and larger sizes? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3308.12s)]
*  What do we need to be doing and putting in place in order to encourage that investment moving forward? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3311.9199999999996s)]
*  And apologies, I was taking notes all day on my phone. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3316.52s)]
*  So apologies as I run through these. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3320.12s)]
*  But to take the next steps, it's really important to take the next steps. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3323.9199999999996s)]
*  But to take the next steps, it's really going to take that next level of collaboration [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3327.32s)]
*  and to a degree within the limits of intellectual property open sourcing. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3331.52s)]
*  So whether that's open sourcing data, how do we share and learn from each other? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3335.92s)]
*  Or how do we actually learn from best practices with respect to policies and regulatory frameworks? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3339.32s)]
*  Panel two. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3346.32s)]
*  So drilling deeper and this is the long-term potential of Superhot Rock. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3347.52s)]
*  So first, I think we all want to go and work on Superhot Rock in New Zealand. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3353.32s)]
*  I think there's been a good sales case for that. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3357.12s)]
*  And again, it's a focus on collaboration except when it comes to between New Zealand and Iceland [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3362.92s)]
*  and you know, geothermal and how and I have to say New Zealand might win out on that one. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3369.3199999999997s)]
*  There is an evolution that's happening now and it's happening tremendously quickly [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3380.52s)]
*  between the geothermal industry and oil and gas. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3385.12s)]
*  And these but these are they're similar industries, but they are not the same industry. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3389.12s)]
*  And the oil and gas sector is separate, geothermal is separate, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3393.72s)]
*  and there's a lot of crossover that can happen. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3396.92s)]
*  But geothermal is going to take its own path and it's going to be unique [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3398.52s)]
*  and it's going to be fascinating to see how innovation transforms in that space [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3402.3199999999997s)]
*  and looking around the room, the people that we have attending today [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3407.3199999999997s)]
*  and how we can take these messages forward is going to be incredibly important [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3411.52s)]
*  how we can actually build on each other's work and to spread the ability for geothermal to evolve [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3414.32s)]
*  and move ahead even faster to really reach the potential that we've been talking about all day. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3420.52s)]
*  But it really is going to take not just pushing the envelope, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3427.52s)]
*  but we need to also reshape the narrative on geothermal. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3430.92s)]
*  So that was one of the big takeaways that I had from the second panel as well. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3435.1200000000003s)]
*  And then panel three, you know, as Drew said, it's the panel open for business. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3439.52s)]
*  Really impressive between Kenya and Indonesia and walking the talk. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3444.7200000000003s)]
*  We have a lot to learn, but congratulations to both on the leadership that they have in the geothermal space. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3448.52s)]
*  It's really incredible. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3455.52s)]
*  And also too with Indonesia's succession to the OECD, bringing on the sovereign wealth fund, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3458.1200000000003s)]
*  there is so much potential there and in Kenya as well. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3463.52s)]
*  They are open for business. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3467.7200000000003s)]
*  But what we can do in looking at the policy learnings, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3470.32s)]
*  so it's sharing of data, regulatory frameworks, government signaling. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3474.52s)]
*  So so important for Kenya, for example, to be supporting those early stages at 49 percent [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3478.32s)]
*  and then also focus on de-risking. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3483.92s)]
*  And there's not, you know, as we heard from from Chesco, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3486.52s)]
*  there's not another technology that has more bipartisan support. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3489.52s)]
*  So we heard that in the EU. We've heard that here in the US. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3493.1200000000003s)]
*  It is really, you know, other perhaps in some spaces than nuclear. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3496.7200000000003s)]
*  It is really an incredibly unique technology in that aspect. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3500.12s)]
*  So we will be doing a heating and cooling strategy for the end of this year, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3505.92s)]
*  beginning of next year under under the new leadership. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3509.52s)]
*  But it's really the heating and cooling sector where we have a tremendous amount of low-hanging fruit in the EU. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3514.52s)]
*  And so if you look, I mean, I've seen the maps. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3521.7200000000003s)]
*  If you look at where we use heating in buildings and the building sector, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3524.32s)]
*  and you take a look at where we have carbon emissions from those same sectors, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3531.1200000000003s)]
*  and then you overlap with the, you know, the work on geothermal potential, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3534.32s)]
*  it just it pops right out at you. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3538.32s)]
*  So there's a tremendous opportunity that we have in and across the EU. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3539.52s)]
*  We see Germany moving the needle. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3544.52s)]
*  So an amazing series of geothermal projects. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3546.32s)]
*  I mean, absolutely incredible. I was astounded. Not quite ready to frack yet. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3548.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not just kidding. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3555.32s)]
*  But it may be the home of innovation for closed-loop technology in particular. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3556.7200000000003s)]
*  And so it's going to be really fascinating to see on the district heating and cooling side in Germany, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3560.92s)]
*  and also on closed-loop what we see come out. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3564.92s)]
*  And Italy, maybe fracking is not that bad. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3569.32s)]
*  And if you need a geothermal turbine, we know where to go. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3573.32s)]
*  So a huge thank you to all of you. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3577.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'm very, very keen to hear what you have learned today. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3580.32s)]
*  I hope we've had a great time. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3584.52s)]
*  I don't want to take any more of your time before the cocktail hour, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3585.7200000000003s)]
*  but just a huge thanks to everyone that has dedicated their afternoon, their day, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3588.52s)]
*  their prep time over the last few days and weeks for this. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3592.92s)]
*  Have a great evening and hope to see you again here sometime soon. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvifX8Zusk&t=3596.52s)]
