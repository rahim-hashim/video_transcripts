# Glenn Rips Apart Biden’s “Save Democracy” Speech
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM)
*  The president of the United States, Joe Biden delivered a speech today, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=0.0s)]
*  obviously was intended to have this feel of something quite profound. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=10.44s)]
*  It was about American democracy and the threats that it is under. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  And those threats, according to Joe Biden, unsurprisingly come not from his party or [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=20.0s)]
*  from his administration or his presidency, but rather from Donald Trump and Donald [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=24.72s)]
*  Trump's movement. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=30.16s)]
*  It was interesting that he actually didn't suggest that the threat to democracy [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=32.0s)]
*  comes from Nikki Haley or even Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=35.72s)]
*  Instead, his focus was Donald Trump, to whom he compared to Adolf Hitler and to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=40.4s)]
*  Nazis. And this is clearly intended in part to be a preview of the theme of Joe [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=46.08s)]
*  Biden's candidacy that you may think his brain is melting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=52.36s)]
*  You may think the economy is in shambles. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=55.64s)]
*  You may think that he's supporting a genocide and Nazi battalions in Ukraine. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=57.84s)]
*  But he wants to tell you that as much as you hate Joe Biden, as much as polls show [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=63.44s)]
*  that people don't trust him or have faith in his competence, that basically he's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=67.44s)]
*  running against Hitler. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  That's what American politics in so many ways has been reduced to is just everybody [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=74.6s)]
*  running around calling each other racist and bigots and Hitler. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=79.56s)]
*  We actually prepared a montage from two weeks ago of how every time there's a new [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=82.92s)]
*  war to fight or a potential new war to fight, the leaders of the countries or the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=88.16s)]
*  groups that the media and the government want you to hate instantly get compared to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=93.44s)]
*  Adolf Hitler. And then you have two choices. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=97.68s)]
*  You either support the war and you get to be Winston Churchill, brave and steadfast [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=100.04s)]
*  in saving American saving Western democracy from the Nazis, or you'll be condemned [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  if you oppose this new war as being Neville Chamberlain, an appeaser or even worse, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  a Nazi sympathizer. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  And this is what every side now does. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, people who oppose the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=122.2s)]
*  War in Ukraine were accused of appeasement, accused of being on the side of the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=125.12s)]
*  Russians. Putin was accused of being a Hitler figure, which means that anybody who [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=129.08s)]
*  didn't want to go to war against Putin was Neville Chamberlain or even a Nazi [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=134.6s)]
*  sympathizer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=138.56s)]
*  And now constantly with the war in Israel and Gaza, if you don't support the U.S. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  funding of Israel, it means that you're a Nazi as well because you're probably [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=145.64s)]
*  anti-Semitic, don't like Jews. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=148.64s)]
*  That's the only possible reason why you might not support what the Israelis are [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=151.04s)]
*  doing in Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=154.84s)]
*  So the narrative goes just basically everybody running around calling each [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=155.64s)]
*  other Hitler, calling each other racist and bigots and Nazis. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=158.76s)]
*  That's what American political rhetoric has been reduced to. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=161.84s)]
*  So this speech was really designed to set that tone, obviously coming one day [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=166.92s)]
*  before January 6. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=171.0s)]
*  It's intended to exploit the emotions of January 6 to try and imply or suggest or [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=172.68s)]
*  outright state that we only have two alternatives as Americans. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  We either vote for Joe Biden or we watch as American democracy end. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  So let's take a look at a couple of the lowlights or highlights for the most [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=188.32s)]
*  revealing parts to give you a sense for what Joe Biden said. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=191.36s)]
*  They apparently did something to make him extra angry and energetic today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  Here's part of what he said. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  1,200 people have been charged for their assault on the Capitol. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  Nearly 900 of them have been convicted or pled guilty. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=207.44000000000003s)]
*  Collectively to date, they have been sentenced to more than 840 years in prison. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=211.72000000000003s)]
*  What's Trump done? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=221.36s)]
*  Instead of calling them criminals, he's called these insurrectionist patriots. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=223.68s)]
*  Now, let me just stop and say there that of the vast majority of people who have [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  been convicted in connection with January 6 and sent to prison are not even alleged [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=236.4s)]
*  to have engaged in violence, not even alleged to have used violence. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=242.24s)]
*  These are nonviolent protesters. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  The vast majority, obviously, violence was used on January 6 by some of the people [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=247.84s)]
*  who were present. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=252.0s)]
*  A lot of them assaulted police officers, but the vast majority of them aren't even [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=254.52s)]
*  accused of engaging in violence. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  And now that we got to see all of the video instead of just the video handpicked [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=261.0s)]
*  by Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney, now that we got to see all of the video, we see [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=265.64s)]
*  that people, a lot of them, entered the room and they were arrested. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  People, a lot of them entered the Capitol because the police were directing them [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=276.52s)]
*  into the Capitol and they were acting peacefully. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=280.4s)]
*  Remember the Q shaman who we saw march around speaking to everybody, sitting on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=283.96s)]
*  the floor, never engaging in violence, was sentenced to almost four years in prison [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  on top of the nine months that he served, even though he was never accused of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=294.28s)]
*  violence. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  The media and the Democrats invented lies about what happened on January 6 to make [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=299.64s)]
*  it seem worse than it was. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=308.2s)]
*  Remember they went around saying that the protesters in defense of Trump murdered a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=309.88s)]
*  Capitol Hill police officer by bashing his head in with a fire extinguisher. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=316.6s)]
*  They said that over and over and over and turned out to be an absolute lie. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=321.6s)]
*  And the reason they invented so many fabrications is similar to the reason [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  there were so many fabrications about October 7 in Israel. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=330.76s)]
*  Dozens of babies beheaded, babies baked in ovens, babies cut out of the womb of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=335.24s)]
*  their mother's stomach, all of which were debunked by Heretz and other Israeli [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=339.64s)]
*  newspapers, none of which turned out to be true. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=343.64s)]
*  There was one baby killed on October 7. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=346.12s)]
*  Obviously there were a lot of terrible things that happened on October 7 by Hamas [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=348.84s)]
*  and Israel, just like there were people who spoke who used violence on January 6 [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=352.84s)]
*  and those people who use violence should of course be prosecuted. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=356.84s)]
*  But when you have to lie about an event to make it worse, it's usually because [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=360.67999999999995s)]
*  you're trying to propagandize the public about it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=364.44s)]
*  The only people who died on January 6, there were a grand total of four of them, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=367.4s)]
*  all four of whom were Trump supporters, two of whom dropped out of a heart [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=372.12s)]
*  attack, one of whom dropped out of a speed overdose, and then the fourth, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=377.08s)]
*  Ashley Babbitt, who was shot and killed at point-blank range by a Capitol Hill [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=382.6s)]
*  police officer. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=386.04s)]
*  Nobody died on January 6 at the Capitol except for those four Trump supporters. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=387.32s)]
*  Brian Sicknick died the following day, he called his parents at night, spoke to them, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=392.12s)]
*  told his mother he was fine, and he died the next day of what the coroner ruled [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=396.92s)]
*  was natural causes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=402.44s)]
*  He did not have his head bashed in by a fire extinguisher, this is a complete lie. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=404.52s)]
*  And the vast majority of people that Biden is talking about here are people who did [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=409.08s)]
*  not engage in violence. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=412.84s)]
*  They're patriots and he promised to pardon them if he returns to office. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump said that there was a lot of love on January 6. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  The rest of the nation, including law enforcement, saw a lot of hate and violence. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  One Capitol police officer called it a medieval battle. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=431.32s)]
*  That same officer called vile, was called vile, raised his names. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  He said he was more afraid in the capital of the United States of America, in the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=440.44s)]
*  chambers, than when he was fighting as a soldier in the war in Iraq. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=446.28s)]
*  He said he was more afraid inside the halls of Congress than fighting in war in Iraq. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=449.55999999999995s)]
*  That may be true, he might have said that, but if he did, it's pathetic. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  Not a single one of the protesters on January 6 wielded a weapon inside the Capitol, not [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  one, let alone a single one of the protesters. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  The only one who discharged weapons were the Capitol Hill police and the only one who [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=472.52s)]
*  was shot was Ashley Babbitt. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=475.96s)]
*  Now, there was some terrible assault on some of the police officers there. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=479.32s)]
*  I don't think the Capitol Hill police force is particularly accustomed to engaging in [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=483.56s)]
*  physical confrontation. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't seem to be a very skilled or well-fit fighting force, that's for sure. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  So I'm sure it was unpleasant for them. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  A couple of them committed suicide later on. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=497.96s)]
*  Who knows why suicide is very difficult to assess. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=500.76s)]
*  But the reality is that the vast, vast majority of people sentenced for January 6 did not [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=503.88s)]
*  commit violence and the only people who died on January 6, despite the lies repeatedly [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=509.96s)]
*  told by the media in the most melodramatic and manipulative ways, were the police officers. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=514.6s)]
*  The only people who died on January 6, despite the lies repeatedly told by the media in the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=519.8s)]
*  most melodramatic and manipulative ways, were Trump supporters. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=523.4799999999999s)]
*  Here is a second segment from our president speaking in a very animated way for him about [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  American democracy and the risks it faces. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  Now, I think actually that what Biden's saying there is true. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=540.44s)]
*  There's no confusion about who Trump is. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=567.96s)]
*  And the reason this is such a difficult strategy for Joe Biden, of course he wants to make [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=570.6800000000001s)]
*  the election about Donald Trump. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  The last thing you want to do is make it about Joe Biden. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=578.2800000000001s)]
*  No one likes Joe Biden or very few Americans like Joe Biden. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=580.84s)]
*  The only chance they have is to try and say that Trump is a Hitler figure. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=585.48s)]
*  The problem they have is that Trump was actually already president for four years. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  People watched as he did not build death camps. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=595.1600000000001s)]
*  He did not haul minorities into prisons other than Julian Assange, who is now being prosecuted [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=598.84s)]
*  by the Biden administration. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=609.24s)]
*  His administration did not imprison journalists or critics of his administration or dissidents. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=611.8000000000001s)]
*  None of this happened. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=617.24s)]
*  The other irony of all of this is that Joe Biden is actually the president who has spent [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=620.52s)]
*  the last 18 months, almost two years now, arming actual Nazis in Ukraine. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=626.36s)]
*  How many shows have we done documenting the very pervasive neo-Nazi ideology that governs [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=631.48s)]
*  the Ukrainians most devoted fighters, the Azov battalion and all those people who appear [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=639.4s)]
*  using Nazi insignia? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=646.36s)]
*  Those are the actual Nazis and those are the people that Joe Biden has been arming [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=647.96s)]
*  with lethal weapons for two years now. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=652.6s)]
*  That is the Democratic Party. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=657.32s)]
*  They see critics of the Democratic Party and they scream Nazi and Hitler, but then they [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=659.08s)]
*  meet real Nazis, like the real deal in Ukraine and they say, oh, let's arm these people. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=665.08s)]
*  And that's what the Biden administration has done until Israel. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=669.8000000000001s)]
*  That was the most significant foreign policy of the Biden administration is flooding that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=672.2s)]
*  country filled with fans of the SS. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=677.32s)]
*  Remember when the Canadian parliament wanted to honor a Ukrainian Canadian who fought in [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=682.36s)]
*  World War II against Russia, they ended up quite embarrassed because like so many of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=688.6s)]
*  them, it turned out that he was an actual SS fighter. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=692.9200000000001s)]
*  Now here is John Favreau, who's the former Obama speechwriter. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=697.4000000000001s)]
*  So he was the one who wrote Obama's speeches. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=702.44s)]
*  He downed the host of the popular Among Democrats podcast, Pod Save America, and he wrote, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=704.2800000000001s)]
*  You can tell Biden feels this democracy speech deeply. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=710.04s)]
*  He's animated and passionate, pretty clear. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=713.4s)]
*  This is why he's running again. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=716.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's not running for his own interest. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=719.32s)]
*  He's not running because he's a lifelong politician who doesn't know how to give up power. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  He's running for you. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=726.2s)]
*  He's running to save democracy because he so passionately believes in it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=727.16s)]
*  Now, as I said, trying to claim that Joe Biden is the only savior of American democracy is not [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=731.32s)]
*  only difficult because people watched Trump for four years and they may not have liked a lot of [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=740.44s)]
*  what he did, but they don't think he's Adolf Hitler. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=744.36s)]
*  But also, it is Joe Biden who is trying to imprison Donald Trump. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=749.32s)]
*  The thing they said Trump was threatening to do with Hillary Clinton and never did, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=755.72s)]
*  that is what the Biden administration now, the Justice Department, is trying to do to Donald Trump. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=760.6s)]
*  They're trying to imprison him. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=764.44s)]
*  There are two cases under the auspices of the Biden Justice Department brought by a special [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=767.48s)]
*  counselor, Jack Smith, they're trying to turn Trump into a felon. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=770.68s)]
*  On top of that, Democratic Party activist groups and interest groups all over the country are [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=775.48s)]
*  trying to keep Trump off the ballot. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=781.96s)]
*  So they see polls revealing that more Americans want to vote for Trump as president than any [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=784.6800000000001s)]
*  other candidate and their solution is to prevent Americans from being able to vote for Trump [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=790.84s)]
*  by claiming he committed a crime that he was never even charged with, let alone convicted of, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=797.32s)]
*  which is insurrection. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=801.08s)]
*  And then they turn around and they hold themselves up as the saviors of American democracy, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=803.32s)]
*  the people trying to imprison their political opponent, ban him from the ballot. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  And then they also, and it's amazing how much this has been memory-holed, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=812.6s)]
*  they were found, the Biden administration was, by four federal judges, all four who ruled on this [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=818.36s)]
*  question, a federal district court judge in the first instance and then three appellate judges who [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=823.96s)]
*  unanimously affirm that ruling, found that the Biden administration engaged in what they called [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=829.24s)]
*  one of the gravest assaults on the First Amendment's free speech guarantee in years, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=836.2s)]
*  if not in the history of the judiciary, they said, by systematically weaponizing the CIA, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=841.08s)]
*  the FBI, the CDC, and other federal agencies to coerce and threaten big tech to censor dissent [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=847.1600000000001s)]
*  from the internet. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=852.9200000000001s)]
*  That was the story that Matt Taibbi and other journalists broke as part of the Twitter files [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=855.08s)]
*  and you probably remember that most members of corporate media, upon seeing that story that they [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=858.76s)]
*  didn't break and couldn't break, turned around and said, oh, this story is nothing, it's a nothing [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=865.0s)]
*  burger, you should ignore it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=869.88s)]
*  Only for courts to then say that it was a grave assault on the First Amendment free speech, that [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=872.84s)]
*  they were trying to censor the free speech rights of American citizens. I know you probably don't [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=876.84s)]
*  remember that because it got so little attention in the media and barely anyone talks about it [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=880.68s)]
*  anymore because it's a ruling against Joe Biden and so the media wants to bury it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=885.64s)]
*  But for that same administration that got that ruling against them to then turn around and [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=891.4s)]
*  depict themselves as the savior of American democracy and be taken seriously by the media [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=895.08s)]
*  is not really amazing any longer but it is truly illustrative. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=901.88s)]
*  Now even CNN is being very clear about what the Biden strategy is and again, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=906.6s)]
*  this is their only choice. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=913.48s)]
*  From January 2nd, how the Biden campaign hopes to make 2024 less about Biden [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=915.08s)]
*  and more about a contrast with Trump. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=920.2800000000001s)]
*  Quote, the 2024 campaign year for President Joe Biden's inner circle will largely be about [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=922.12s)]
*  carefully ratcheting up the intensity against Donald Trump, wary of voters becoming dulled [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=927.16s)]
*  to what they expect to be the former president's even wilder rhetoric and promises about what [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=932.12s)]
*  he'll do back in power. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  Or as some of the younger aides on Biden's reelection campaign have grimly joked, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=938.8399999999999s)]
*  it's about when to go, quote, full Hitler. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=944.12s)]
*  When the leading Republican candidates' speeches and actions go so far that the Biden team goes [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=947.3199999999999s)]
*  all the way to a direct comparison to the Nazi leader rather than couching their attacks by [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=951.88s)]
*  saying Trump, quote, parroted him. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=957.4s)]
*  Now again, it's not only that this is the same administration that's trying to imprison their [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=961.88s)]
*  opponent, trying to bar him from the ballot, it was found also to have committed great First [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=966.28s)]
*  Amendment violations according to two federal courts by censoring the dissent of American [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=971.24s)]
*  citizens and their speech from the internet by threatening big tech companies, the CIA and the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=978.76s)]
*  FBI. It's also the fact that as the New York Times even acknowledged in June of 2023, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=983.48s)]
*  that the Ukrainians that the Biden administration has spent the last almost two years now [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=990.76s)]
*  arming with lethal weapons have a extreme fondness for Nazi insignia and Nazi symbols. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=995.3199999999999s)]
*  They revere as national heroes people like Stepan Pandera, who was a collaborator with [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1002.04s)]
*  the Nazis and rounding up Ukrainian Jews and slaughtering Poles. Here's the headline, Nazi [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1007.48s)]
*  symbols on Ukraine's front lines highlight thorny issues of history. And it's all about how many [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1013.4s)]
*  times we've seen Ukrainian militia leaders, Ukrainian political leaders, Ukrainian generals [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1021.24s)]
*  and colonels appearing in the media, even in the West, wearing outright Nazi insignia or having [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1027.88s)]
*  pictures of Nazi collaborators on their wall. I think it's a little bit difficult to try and run [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1034.04s)]
*  in a campaign of accusing your opponent who used to be the president of the United States [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1039.48s)]
*  of being a Hitler figure when you spent two years as your primary foreign policy [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1044.84s)]
*  sending some of the most sophisticated weapons in the world to militias and troops who openly [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1049.8s)]
*  embrace not just Nazi symbolism but neo-Nazi ideology and who for a decade before the Russians [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1057.88s)]
*  invaded were constantly spoken of that way by the Western press that these were serious Nazi menaces. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1065.64s)]
*  There was movements in Congress to try and ban the Azov battalion and others from getting American [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1074.2s)]
*  weapons on the ground that they were the real Nazis. And then on February of 2022, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1078.7600000000002s)]
*  that narrative switched. The Western media stopped calling the Azov battalion neo-Nazis, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1084.2s)]
*  first started calling them far right, then nationalists, and then running [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1090.6000000000001s)]
*  slobbering pieces of hagiography. That's how war propaganda worked. But don't forget what the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1095.08s)]
*  Biden administration was doing in Ukraine. Don't forget what they've been doing on the internet [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1101.96s)]
*  according to two federal courts. And don't forget that they're doing exactly the thing that when we [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1105.24s)]
*  look at other countries where it's being done we instantly conclude those are the hallmarks not of [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1110.12s)]
*  saving democracy but destroying democracy, namely trying to keep their primary political opponent [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  ahead in the polls off the ballot and also trying to put them in prison. This seems like a desperate [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1120.12s)]
*  effort to me. For sure it's going to get cheered by the American media. I think the most interesting [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1129.2399999999998s)]
*  part about it aside from their recognition, the Democrats recognition, that they cannot run with [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1133.8s)]
*  anyone thinking about Joe Biden instead trying to make them think about Trump, is the fact that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1138.2s)]
*  they are going to have an extremely difficult time simultaneously deconstructing democracy [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdEf2jegUKM&t=1145.24s)]
