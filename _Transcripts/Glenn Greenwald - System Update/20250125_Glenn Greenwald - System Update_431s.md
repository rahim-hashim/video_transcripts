# From Wounded to Happy & Affectionate: Greg's Stunning 180
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU)
*  This week's star of the System Update episode is named Greg, or as it's pronounced in Portuguese, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=0.0s)]
*  Greggy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=13.58s)]
*  And as you will see, he had a very horrific origin. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=14.58s)]
*  He was very violently abused. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  He had a lot of the hallmarks of terrible abuse in the ways that dogs are mistreated. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=19.96s)]
*  He had a lot of injuries and wounds. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  He had a lot of empathy for dogs, but he did not have the capability to bring them home [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=28.86s)]
*  and care for him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=33.3s)]
*  And so through friends, he found us and gave it to us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=34.3s)]
*  We kept him at our house. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=37.74s)]
*  He recovered, he recuperated physically, and he turned into an extremely affectionate dog. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=38.94s)]
*  It's one of those dog rescue stories that really makes dog rescue so gratifying, but [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=44.34s)]
*  it also illustrates the kinds of things you can learn from a dog and its resilience, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  also the ways in which life can so easily change just through the bare minimum of affection [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=52.74s)]
*  and love that every living being deserves. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=58.02s)]
*  Here is our System Update installment for this evening starring Greg. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  All right, so the star of this episode's System Update is actually the dog that is the newest, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  most recently arrived dog in our house. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=79.26s)]
*  His name is Greg, or in Portuguese, Greggy, which is what everyone here calls him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=82.18s)]
*  He definitely was abused. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=87.58000000000001s)]
*  He had somehow escaped wherever he was, but he had these hideous chain marks around his [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  neck just having been on a chain for so long. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=96.06s)]
*  The chain marks were digging into his neck. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  You can actually see some of the areas where the chain was. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=100.94000000000001s)]
*  It's been a couple months, so he's now almost fully healed, but you can still see some of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=104.62s)]
*  the places where the hair is not growing correctly. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=108.98s)]
*  Look at this coward. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=110.98s)]
*  He rescued yesterday, behind the church of São Sebastião, at 11pm. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=113.18s)]
*  They threw him out, wrapped him in a plastic bag. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  Look at the state of this dog. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=121.14s)]
*  At least he was tied with... [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=122.98s)]
*  Wait a minute, calm down. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=125.14s)]
*  He was tied with a wire and cut his neck. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=126.98s)]
*  Look at how many holes he has. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=132.38s)]
*  One, two, here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  He was very dirty. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=139.78s)]
*  He was full of worms. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=140.88s)]
*  He had anemia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=142.06s)]
*  He was on the street, just kind of wandering around. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=144.66s)]
*  There's a certain kind of way that homeless abandoned dogs wander. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=147.66s)]
*  It's kind of like a desperation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=152.26s)]
*  They just have nowhere to go. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=153.72s)]
*  They just kind of run because they want to stay safe. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=154.94s)]
*  They're on guard. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=158.46s)]
*  They don't trust anyone yet. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=159.46s)]
*  But you can see they're just aimless. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=161.1s)]
*  They don't know where they're going. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=163.84s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=164.84s)]
*  They need food. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=165.84s)]
*  They need water. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=166.84s)]
*  They don't feel well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=167.84s)]
*  They have to keep moving. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  They can't just stop. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what he was like. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  He was one of those dogs that almost immediately recovered. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  Like, as soon as we took him here, within a day, he trusted everybody. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=179.38s)]
*  He loved everybody. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=183.94s)]
*  He wanted to just play. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=184.94s)]
*  He got slowly better over time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  We actually tried to find a home for him for a while. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  And probably still are. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=192.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=194.22s)]
*  It would be pretty hard to part with him at this point. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=195.22s)]
*  For the right home and the right person, I might do so. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=196.5s)]
*  He's pure mutt. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=200.1s)]
*  He doesn't, I mean, there's maybe a little bit of poodle. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=201.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=204.46s)]
*  It's very, it's very hard to tell. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=205.46s)]
*  He's really a street dog. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=207.86s)]
*  He's just one of those pure mutts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=208.94s)]
*  And honestly, in my experience, mutts make, in a lot of ways, the best dogs. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=210.5s)]
*  There are exceptions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=216.5s)]
*  The dog that was closest to me was almost a pure miniature pincher that we found only [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=217.5s)]
*  because this couple bought him, this horrible gay couple that wanted to buy a very expensive [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=224.62s)]
*  dog to show off there to their friends. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=228.86s)]
*  And after they did that, they were like, oh, we don't want him destroying all our art and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=230.06s)]
*  all our furniture and strongly implied that they were going to abandon him on the street [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=234.18s)]
*  to David one day at a party. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  And David was like, we're going to your house right now and picking him up. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=239.46s)]
*  And that became like the dog closest to me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=241.66000000000003s)]
*  So that was a pure breed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=243.62s)]
*  But in general, mutts like this are super healthy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=244.62s)]
*  They're very smart. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=248.62s)]
*  They're super affectionate. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't have like some pure breed behavior embedded into their DNA. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=252.78s)]
*  So they can be almost anything. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=257.22s)]
*  They're very adaptable. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=259.42s)]
*  And this dog, look at him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=260.42s)]
*  He's just super sweet. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=262.1s)]
*  Look at how he just wants to sit here in my lap, just kind of chill, hang out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=263.1s)]
*  He loves to play. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=268.42s)]
*  He runs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=269.42s)]
*  He's very good with other dogs. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=270.42s)]
*  And this is kind of like a classic dog rescue story where you find a dog that's abused. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=272.14s)]
*  But for him, oftentimes the dogs that are abused take a long time to heal mentally, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=278.88s)]
*  longer than physically. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=283.32s)]
*  With him, for whatever reason, he is such a trusting dog that despite the abuse he endured, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=284.32s)]
*  he just immediately started loving everybody. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=289.6s)]
*  He made himself very much at home right away here. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=291.08s)]
*  I've taken him to the studio several times and he just he adapted very, very quickly, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=293.52s)]
*  which is kind of unusual, but that just shows his disposition. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=300.4s)]
*  He's still pretty much a puppy, like maybe a year and a little bit old. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=303.24s)]
*  So he might even grow some more. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=306.88s)]
*  But yeah, this is one of the easier rescue stories, but obviously very gratifying as [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=310.44s)]
*  well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=314.2s)]
*  In times like these, uncertainty is the only certainty. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=319.2s)]
*  From geopolitical risks like the ones we've seen in the Middle East and Ukraine, both [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=322.76s)]
*  of which risk the stabilizing global markets, to the Fed's nonstop money printing, it's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=326.32s)]
*  hard to feel secure about your financial future. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=331.04s)]
*  Because 2020, the US dollar has lost 24% of its buying power and with inflation rising [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=333.76s)]
*  and government debt ballooning, your hard earned savings are at risk. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-QIi6giKmU&t=338.84s)]
