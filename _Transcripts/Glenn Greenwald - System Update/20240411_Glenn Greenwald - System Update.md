# 19 Republicans Defy Speaker Johnson to Kill Domestic Spying Bill
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8)
*  Two months before he became House Speaker in the wake of the coup against Speaker Kevin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=0.0s)]
*  McCarthy and then that protracted fight over who was going to be House Speaker, we interviewed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=13.88s)]
*  Congressman Johnson, who is now the House Speaker, in order to question him about a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=20.6s)]
*  variety of things. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=28.16s)]
*  It was on the day when the FBI Director Christopher Wray had appeared before a committee on which [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=29.16s)]
*  then Congressman Johnson served and he was quite eloquent in his denunciations of the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=37.04s)]
*  U.S. security state in general, its attempt to control the Internet in particular. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  We asked him about that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=51.28s)]
*  We asked him about spying powers on the part of the government. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=52.56s)]
*  He said he believes that those powers had been abused. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=55.76s)]
*  He talked about the FBI and the abuse of FBI power. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=60.04s)]
*  He talked about his opposition to the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=62.72s)]
*  Views that he steadfastly said he held and that his voting record suggested he held. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=66.56s)]
*  In 2018 he voted against the renewal of FISA, which is the bill that allows the FBI and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=71.56s)]
*  the NSA to spy on Americans without warrants. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  He also talked about his opposition to funding the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=84.04s)]
*  Then he became Speaker and a lot of things changed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=86.92s)]
*  He's now working, as we'll show you, to ensure that Joe Biden gets what he wants and end [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=91.04s)]
*  up with another $60 billion to Ukraine. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=95.68s)]
*  But he also, for inexplicable reasons, has become someone who is now dedicated to ensuring [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=98.56s)]
*  that this FISA spying bill, which was last renewed in 2018, which is now up for renewal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=107.64s)]
*  again, if it's not renewed again it will expire. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=112.88s)]
*  And what many members of Congress on the left and the right are saying is that these spying [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=116.4s)]
*  powers are too broad, they're too limitless. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  Nobody wants to do away with the FBI or NSA's authority to spy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=127.08s)]
*  That's what those agencies exist to do. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=132.56s)]
*  That's an important part of criminal investigations or foreign intelligence. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=134.52s)]
*  The problem is that the NSA was supposed to be an agency that spied on non-Americans, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=139.16s)]
*  on foreign adversaries. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=144.72s)]
*  And yet increasingly what happened, and it was very predictable at the time when this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=146.08s)]
*  law was enacted in 2008 under the Bush administration and allowed warrantless eavesdropping, is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=150.96s)]
*  that they began spying on Americans in mass without having first to go to a court and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  get a warrant. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=161.44s)]
*  This requirement embedded in the Constitution is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=162.8s)]
*  in the Constitution that the government cannot spy on you, cannot listen to your confrontations, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=169.2s)]
*  cannot take your papers, cannot seize your property without first going to a court and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=175.64s)]
*  convincing a court that they are probable cause, that you actually did something wrong, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=180.72s)]
*  that they have a reason, a legitimate reason to spy on you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=184.28s)]
*  The government's not supposed to be spying on American citizens and yet they do it all [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=188.16s)]
*  the time under this bill that was first enacted in the name of the War on Terror and has [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=191.36s)]
*  been repeatedly renewed without a single reform, including just the requirement of warrants. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  And so finally, when it was up this year, many people on the right, many Republicans [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=203.56s)]
*  in Congress, many on the left, many Democrats said that they will not renew FISA unless [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=209.08s)]
*  it has serious reforms, serious protections for Americans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=216.4s)]
*  And yet, Mike Johnson, who originally said that he agreed that there needed to be reforms [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=222.08s)]
*  before FISA was renewed, earlier today attempted to bring to the floor a vote that would have [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=226.84s)]
*  allowed Congress to simply pass FISA with no reforms. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=233.72s)]
*  And because it was a rules vote, technically, it's very rare that members of any caucus, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=239.36s)]
*  the House Republican caucus or the House Democrat caucus, defy their leaders and defect [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=245.64s)]
*  on a rules vote. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=249.6s)]
*  And yet, 19 Republicans joined with all Democrats to vote no on bringing this bill to the floor [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  and as a result, it was not brought to the floor and now it could expire without renewal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=258.36s)]
*  Now, one potential reason this happened is because Donald Trump, who had not commented [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=264.88s)]
*  on this until today, went to True Social this morning and posted this, quote, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=271.8s)]
*  Kill FISA. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=278.20000000000005s)]
*  It was illegally used against me and many others. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  They spied on my campaign. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=282.44000000000005s)]
*  DJ T. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=284.44000000000005s)]
*  Now I actually almost went on Twitter yesterday to complain that Trump hasn't yet manifested [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=288.0s)]
*  or spoken about this bill and obviously he should given his personal experience. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=295.0s)]
*  But then I decided not to because I knew there was a chance that he might today and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=300.52s)]
*  didn't want to seem like he was being pressured and so I was glad to see that tweet because [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  obviously that's important in giving these Republicans the space and the license to abandon [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=307.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson as speaker and vote no. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=313.84s)]
*  Here from the New York Times today, it's report on what happened after Trump broadside surveillance [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  bill collapses in the House. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  Quote, right wing lawmakers blocked a move by Speaker Johnson to extend a key foreign [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=324.96s)]
*  intelligence surveillance tool. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  Look at the New York Times. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=332.56s)]
*  The New York Times was part of the Snowden reporting. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  My colleague Laura Poitras published several articles with the New York Times that reported [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=337.88s)]
*  on the abuses of the spying system. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=342.67999999999995s)]
*  And yet look at how the New York Times, because Trump and GOP lawmakers are opposed to this [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=346.0s)]
*  extension and Joe Biden is in favor of it, look at how they herald this bill to make [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  you think that it's some crucial bill vital to our national security that these big bad [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=356.6s)]
*  right wing lawmakers and Trump are blocking. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=361.48s)]
*  Quote, right wing lawmakers blocked a move by Speaker Johnson to extend a key foreign [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  intelligence surveillance tool after former President Donald J. Trump urged lawmakers [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=368.6s)]
*  to quote kill the law underlying it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=374.32000000000005s)]
*  And an upset on the House floor, the measure, which would extend a section of the Foreign [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=377.0s)]
*  Intelligence Surveillance Act known as Section 702 failed what is normally a routine version [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=381.16s)]
*  of a procedural vote on a vote of 228 to 193. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=386.72s)]
*  19 House Republicans, most aligned with the ultra conservative House Freedom Caucus, joined [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=391.24s)]
*  Democrats in opposing its consideration. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=397.6s)]
*  Do you see how as well they didn't note until the third paragraph in passing that Democrats [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=399.72s)]
*  also voted no on this? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=405.16s)]
*  Nor did they say that while this bill is called a bill of foreign intelligence gathering, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=406.8s)]
*  it is often the power that is used to spy on American citizens without warrants. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=413.64000000000004s)]
*  What they do is they say, oh, our target is not an American citizen, our target is a foreign [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  national, but they can easily spy on many conversations of Americans without warrants [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=424.04s)]
*  by simply declaring foreign targets that they know are speaking often to Americans. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  A lot of Americans speak to people in Canada, people in Mexico, people in Europe, and so [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=434.36s)]
*  all the NSA or the FBI has to do is say those are our targets and then they get to listen [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=438.88s)]
*  in on multiple conversations of American citizens without the warrants required by [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=442.84s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=446.76s)]
*  Those are the reforms that are being sought. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=448.84s)]
*  Such detect defections were once considered unthinkable, but have become increasingly [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=452.23999999999995s)]
*  common as the hard right has rebelled against GOP leaders. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=457.88s)]
*  We will regroup and reformulate another plan Mr. Johnson set up to the vote. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=462.35999999999996s)]
*  We cannot allow Section 2 of FISA to expire. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  It's too important to national security. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=469.88s)]
*  I think most of the members understand that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=471.8s)]
*  Nobody, Mike Johnson, thinks that this bill should expire. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=476.0s)]
*  The argument is that it should not be renewed without added protections to American citizens. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=479.88s)]
*  And had Speaker Johnson been willing to allow votes on these amendments to reform the bill, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=486.36s)]
*  to limit it, to require warrants, then the bill could have passed easily and we wouldn't [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=493.92s)]
*  be facing the possibility that it will expire without renewables because Speaker Johnson [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=499.76000000000005s)]
*  sided with the national security hawks and the Republican Party, the people who always [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=504.68s)]
*  want to give the U.S. security state everything it wants, the part of the party that wants [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  to fund the war in Ukraine, and decided to do their bidding and the bidding of the NSA [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=512.78s)]
*  and the FBI and the Biden Lighthouse, members of his caucus rebelled. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=517.76s)]
*  The New York Times goes on, quote, under Section 702 the government is empowered to collect [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=523.72s)]
*  without warrants the messages of non-citizens abroad even when those targeted are communicating [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=528.84s)]
*  with Americans. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=535.36s)]
*  As a result, the government sometimes collects Americans' private messages without a warrant. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Exactly, they often do. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  While there are limits on how these messages can be searched for and used, the FBI has [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=545.4s)]
*  repeatedly violated those limits in recent years, including improperly querying for information [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=549.08s)]
*  about Black Lives Matters protesters and people suspected of participating in the January [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=555.08s)]
*  6, 2021, Capitol riot. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  That's pretty significant abuse to be spying on domestic political movements without warrants. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=564.5200000000001s)]
*  That's why you cannot possibly renew this bill without reforms and protections for the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=571.24s)]
*  privacy rights of American citizens guaranteed by the Constitution. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=575.72s)]
*  Quote, Mr. Trump's attack on the measure underscored his lingering grievances about the Russia [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=580.16s)]
*  investigation and his disdain for national security agencies he often disparages as an [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=585.56s)]
*  evil deep state. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=591.0799999999999s)]
*  And this has resonated with his hard-right allies on Capitol Hill, who see blocking the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=593.68s)]
*  extension of the law as a way to inflict pain on the intelligence community they regard [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=597.84s)]
*  as an enemy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=602.62s)]
*  Now, the reason that Donald Trump is actually suspicious of the spying powers of the FBI [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=605.76s)]
*  and the NSA is because, as we know, they spied on Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=614.92s)]
*  People associated with the Trump campaign like Carter Page, and they did so by filing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  false affidavits with the FISA court to the point where an FBI lawyer actually had to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=626.04s)]
*  plead guilty to submitting false documents to the FISA court to get permission to spy [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=631.08s)]
*  on Carter Page and people associated with the Trump campaign. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=635.72s)]
*  And they've abused this repeatedly. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=641.72s)]
*  Now, ordinarily, the New York Times would be objecting to the abuse of domestic spying [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  powers by the U.S. security state, but the realignment that has happened, where Democrats [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=651.2800000000001s)]
*  are fully on the side of the U.S. security state, and there are no votes today, we're [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=656.6800000000001s)]
*  simply procedural, they were opposing Mike Johnson's attempt to bring the bill to the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=660.08s)]
*  floor. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=665.72s)]
*  We'll see how they vote on the actual merits if it's re-broad. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=666.72s)]
*  But that is the realignment that the establishment institutions of American liberalism, like [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=671.44s)]
*  the New York Times, are now fully on the side of the U.S. security state along with the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  And maybe five years ago, they would have described this vote in a much more positive [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=683.1600000000001s)]
*  and praiseworthy way. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=686.52s)]
*  They're now depicting it as some evil subversion, almost treason against our honorable intelligence [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=691.04s)]
*  officials that will jeopardize their benevolent and sincere desire just to keep us safe, even [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=697.02s)]
*  though they just got done saying that the FBI has repeatedly abused these powers for [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=704.12s)]
*  illegitimate domestic political ends. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=709.24s)]
*  Here are the 19 Republicans from the Hill who voted to block the spying powers. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=714.08s)]
*  They actually voted against Speaker Johnson's attempt to bring it to the floor. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=719.12s)]
*  There you see the names. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=723.96s)]
*  Andy Briggs of Arizona, Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Tim [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=726.48s)]

*  Chip Roy of Texas, and Greg Stube of Florida. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=755.0s)]
*  Now, there are many House Republicans, such as Jim Jordan and others, who actually oppose [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=757.92s)]
*  renewal of FISA without reform, but they weren't willing to defy Speaker Johnson on this rules [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  vote. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  It was just a rules vote to bring it to the floor, and it's very rare to have defections [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=772.0s)]
*  because usually each party unites in support of their leadership on rules votes. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=778.84s)]
*  But that would have allowed a vote on this FISA bill, on renewing the FISA bill with [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=784.0s)]
*  no reforms, and there was a significant chance, although it's hard to say for sure, that it [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=788.64s)]
*  would have passed. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=793.2800000000001s)]
*  So these 19 House Republicans did not want to take that risk of allowing this bill to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=795.5600000000001s)]
*  come to the floor because the U.S. security state in Washington generally gets what they [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=800.92s)]
*  want. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=803.88s)]
*  Here is Elizabeth Gotin of the Brennan Center for Justice, one of the most informed experts [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=805.88s)]
*  on all matters concerning domestic spying, and she had an outstanding explanation for [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  what happened. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  It's obviously not simple, and this is what she said, quote, Speaker Johnson has caved [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  to the House Intelligence Committee's Bush League tactics and will block votes on a key [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=822.88s)]
*  reform when Section 702 authorization goes to the House for this week. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=827.8s)]
*  This was her thread from yesterday before the vote actually happened, but she was explaining [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=833.04s)]
*  what Speaker Johnson did, quote, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=838.38s)]
*  The base bill that the House will consider, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=840.3199999999999s)]
*  Act, RISA, contains no meaningful reforms. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=844.88s)]
*  In fact, the bill would actually weaken the FISA Court's oversight of surveillance. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  In February, members of the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committee had reached a deal [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=853.24s)]
*  with Johnson, under which he planned to bring RISA to the floor and allow each committee [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=858.64s)]
*  to offer three amendments. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=864.2s)]
*  The amendment would end the government's practice of evading constitutional and statutory privacy [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=866.6800000000001s)]
*  protections by purchasing American sensitive information from data brokers rather than [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=871.32s)]
*  obtaining the warrant court order subpoena otherwise required by law. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=877.04s)]
*  She also temporarily reported on how the Director of National Intelligence admitted [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=880.88s)]
*  that U.S. security state agencies are buying mass data on American citizens that they would [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=887.16s)]
*  be constitutionally prohibited from collecting on their own, and one of the reforms that [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=891.56s)]
*  members of both parties wants is to ban them from being able to buy data on the private [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=897.0s)]
*  market about Americans. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=901.06s)]
*  She went on, quote, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=903.46s)]
*  Speaker Johnson has showed his true colors. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=904.46s)]
*  His desire to appease House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner outweighs any sense of responsibility [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=907.46s)]
*  he might have to the American people, and he is ready and willing to betray their trust. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=913.12s)]
*  In New York Times today, notice that Speaker Johnson has changed his views on many positions [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=919.82s)]
*  he once claimed to have before becoming Speaker. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=928.38s)]
*  Here you see the headline, as Speaker, Johnson advances what he once supposed, enraging the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=931.46s)]
*  right. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=937.64s)]
*  Now that he is the leader, the Louisiana Republican has found himself bowing to government realities [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=939.0s)]
*  that are now his problem. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=943.1600000000001s)]
*  Quote, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=945.36s)]
*  Johnson repeatedly voted down efforts to send aid to Ukraine before he became Speaker, citing [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=946.36s)]
*  insufficient oversight of where the money would go. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=952.0400000000001s)]
*  He opposed the stopgap funding bill that then Speaker Kevin McCarthy put on the House floor [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=954.3000000000001s)]
*  in an effort to avert a government shutdown. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=959.24s)]
*  He supported a sweeping overhaul favored by libertarians to the law that undergirds [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=961.94s)]
*  a warrantless surveillance program that is reviled by right-wing lawmakers who distrust [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=967.24s)]
*  federal law enforcement. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=972.1s)]
*  But now that he is Speaker Johnson, he has changed his tune considerably, much to the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=974.34s)]
*  chagrin and outrage of the right-wing lawmakers with whom he once found common cause. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=980.02s)]
*  After months of refusing to bring up a bill to send a fresh infusion of aid to Ukraine, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=985.68s)]
*  Mr. Johnson is now searching for a way to advance it, having privately pledged that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=989.66s)]
*  the Congress would, quote, do our job, meaning financing a foreign war. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=994.7399999999999s)]
*  That's the job of Congress. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=998.9s)]
*  Despite a vow in the fall never to pass another stopgap funding bill to keep the government [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1001.4599999999999s)]
*  open, he put forward several to allow more time to negotiate funding agreements with [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1004.9399999999999s)]
*  Democrats that were opposed by many of his members, and on Wednesday the Speaker tried [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1008.56s)]
*  and failed to put to a vote a bill making more modest changes to the surveillance program [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1013.0799999999999s)]
*  over the objections of hard-right lawmakers and activists who have sought to place strict [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1018.3599999999999s)]
*  limits on it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1023.7199999999999s)]
*  Now one of the things going on here is that because there's such a small margin that Republicans [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1026.8s)]
*  have in their majority, if they just a few defect and refuse to support Mike Johnson [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1032.62s)]
*  as Speaker, he can be deposed. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1038.5400000000002s)]
*  That's what happened with Kevin McCarthy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1039.94s)]
*  But the Democrats have told Mike Johnson that if he gets their number one priority passed, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1043.3000000000002s)]
*  which is not anything to help the American people but instead to finance the war in Ukraine, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1049.98s)]
*  as the Guardian reports here, we can see it on the screen, the Democrats will protect [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1055.0600000000002s)]
*  Mike Johnson, House Democratic Minority Leader Huckin Jeffries suggests. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1059.18s)]
*  In other words, if Mike Johnson gets that $60 billion passed that he had always said [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1066.18s)]
*  he opposed, Democratic leadership in Congress is telling Mike Johnson, we'll vote for you [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  as Speaker and keep you as Speaker even if your right wing members try and depose you. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1078.0s)]
*  The Democratic leadership in Congress has suggested it would protect the Republican [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1083.04s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson if he bucks his far-right colleagues and brings a stalled [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1086.68s)]
*  $60 billion Ukraine military aid package to a vote. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1091.92s)]
*  As a new poll shows, public support for Ukraine is now fractured down party political lines. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1096.3600000000001s)]
*  And Huckin Jeffries that goes on to say, said, there's a good number of Democrats who would [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1104.4s)]
*  vote to save the Republican Speaker as long as he gets aid to Ukraine. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1108.78s)]
*  Do you see the top priority of the Democratic Party and the game that Mike Johnson is willing [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1112.88s)]
*  to play to keep himself in power and serving the Biden White House's agenda by financing [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1117.82s)]
*  a foreign word that before becoming Speaker, Mike Johnson has vowed vehemently he opposed [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1123.62s)]
*  and now he does the same thing on a spying bill that he said could not be passed without [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1129.1799999999998s)]
*  reforms and now he's working to ensure its passage without allowing any reforms at all. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1134.1s)]
*  It's a very good glimpse into the dirty filthy game of how Washington is played, but actually [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1139.98s)]
*  it's good news what happened today. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1145.58s)]
*  The 19 Republicans were willing to defect and defy him and vote no on bringing this [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1147.4199999999998s)]
*  bill to the floor and enraged he was, according to reports, and threatened House members who [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1152.72s)]
*  voted no by saying, you will suffer serious consequences. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1159.34s)]
*  We will certainly continue to follow this story since warrantless spying on Americans [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njc5wt7fEZ8&t=1163.08s)]
