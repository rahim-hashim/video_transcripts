# Comedian Dave Smith on Criticizing Israel and Refusing to Self-Censor
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM)
*  Let me ask you about Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=0.0s)]
*  Sort of just the first personal question. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=7.68s)]
*  I know you've been a critic for Israel for a while before October 7th, but with October 7th, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=9.84s)]
*  I think a lot of things changed. For one thing, it was the first time in years that Israel was [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=16.96s)]
*  really on the front burner of our politics, so people didn't really care if you were an [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=21.48s)]
*  Israel critic because it wasn't really being discussed. The second thing is, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  I think October 7th really radicalized a lot of people. I have a ton of friends in my life [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=28.64s)]
*  who are Jewish, who never much cared about Israel. They were kind of apathetic, maybe a little [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=32.44s)]
*  critical, and it shocked me actually. Not just in the days, but weeks and months after October 7th, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=37.4s)]
*  they became vehement Israel supporters to the point where they were telling me they couldn't [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=41.96s)]
*  even watch my show. Obviously, there are a lot of people who have such strong emotional [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  sentiments about Israel who don't want to hear any Israel criticism. We've lost, I don't know, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  10 to 15 percent of our show, of our audience at the beginning. It's built back up, but it's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=57.24s)]
*  something we anticipated, but it did happen. I know that the very big following that you build [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=62.52s)]
*  up is not really a big left-wing following. You probably have some leftists in your following, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=68.64s)]
*  but I know a lot of them are anything but leftists, and I've seen a lot of them kind of anger at you [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=73.04s)]
*  for the stance you've taken very vocally and continuously in your criticism of Israel. Why [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=77.72s)]
*  was that a stance that you felt was so necessary for you not just to express, but to kind of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  continuously advocate, knowing the difficulties it would cause for you? Well, okay, so that is true. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=88.0s)]
*  I've had a lot of people who were very upset about this. I don't know, man, I made a decision a long [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=94.56s)]
*  time ago that I'm just gonna tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may. And, you know, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=103.36s)]
*  when I say the truth, the truth is I see it, and I might be wrong. I'm sure I am wrong about some [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=111.52s)]
*  things, but very few. And I just, that was, there was, I mean, there was a period of time, I remember [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=116.32s)]
*  when I first started getting invited onto Fox News shows, which like the first time I ever got on [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=125.24s)]
*  television, like in 2015 or something like that, so like around 10 years ago. And I remember, look, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=131.24s)]
*  I was never told this exactly. But they, when I first came on, I had some good appearances on a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=139.32s)]
*  few different shows. And there were some like producers at Fox News who were like, hey, there's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=146.6s)]
*  like people upstairs who are talking about you, they want to have a meeting with you. They would [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=150.68s)]
*  like if you weren't too crazy, you know, and like, I just kind of knew without anyone ever telling me [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=155.08s)]
*  this, that like, if I could just kind of compromise some of my more anti war views or some of this, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=160.8s)]
*  that I could maybe get like a cushy job here. And that when I was dead broke, that was like, really [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=166.64s)]
*  tempting. And in that moment, I just decided I was like, listen, my heroes, my heroes are like Ron [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=174.72s)]
*  Paul, and people like that. And what I love about them is that they said the thing that would get [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  them booed out of the arena that they were in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=187.04s)]
*  Including on Israel, including on Israel, Ron Paul wasn't very outspoken critical of Israel and the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  US relationship to it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=194.72s)]
*  And as a Texas Republican, you know, and so I just made a decision back then when I was dead broke, I [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=196.8s)]
*  made a decision that I would have integrity and just tell the truth. So now like I'm doing pretty [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=205.56s)]
*  well. I mean, not as good as some people I'm doing. I'm making way more than I should. And so at this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=210.52s)]
*  point, it's like, Oh, no, I don't know. That's just what I'm going to do. And I should I think that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=218.24s)]
*  I'm supposed to piss my audience off sometimes. Like I remember, I was in the summer of 2020. So I [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  had been I had been very against the lockdowns and all of the COVID insanity. And then I was really [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  critical of Black Lives Matter during the summer of 2020. And particularly of like the rioting and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  just how insane that was. And that after the country had been through like the most devastating [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  three or four months in modern American history, that you had these bands of people going around [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  and like destroying small businesses who are like desperate to keep their doors open. And I was [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=256.2s)]
*  just so disgusted by like the looting and the rioting and stuff like that. And then months later, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=261.44s)]
*  when that guy Chauvin got convicted for murder in the first degree, and I was like, I remember [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=268.76s)]
*  tweeting about it and being like, good for him. He deserves to go to jail. But like, you know, I [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=277.4s)]
*  think that was the right decision. And my audience was like, Oh, Dave, what you're siding with CNN [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=281.44s)]
*  now. I thought you were a critic of Black Lives Matter and all of this. And I was like, Yeah, but [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm what? Like, just because I hate people rioting and looting doesn't mean I think a cop who had [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=291.2s)]
*  like a handcuffed guy on the ground who was in the middle of a panic attack and just knee laid his [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  knee on his neck for 10 minutes isn't like, you know what I mean? So like, okay, fine. So you could [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=304.64s)]
*  my audience could be upset with me a little bit. I think the bond I have with my audience is that I [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  always say, I'm going to tell you the truth as I see it. So okay, I'm going to do that in every [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=317.28s)]
*  situation. And I just think that, you know, to your point, where there were a lot of people who [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=322.38s)]
*  maybe weren't like super aware or super involved in what was going on in Israel, I do kind of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=328.84s)]
*  understand that if you just looked at October 7, you'd be like, Oh, this is like the most brutal [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=334.24s)]
*  thing I've ever seen. And so of course, we should be against that. But I've just been paying [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=339.16s)]
*  attention a while longer than that. And I also know how brutal Israel's occupation of Palestine [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  has been. And that just gives you a totally different perspective on it. And I'm aware I've [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=351.72s)]
*  read a ton about this. I just I know a lot about the history. I'm not saying like I'm an expert or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=356.76s)]
*  anything. There's people who know more than me. But I know I know a decent amount and I know [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=361.8s)]
*  enough to understand that it look the thing that the moment that sparked my interest on [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=366.04s)]
*  libertarianism and what led me down this whole rabbit hole was the Ron Paul Giuliani moment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=376.2s)]
*  And I know you've played this clip on your show not fairly recently, but I know you've seen it way [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=381.8s)]
*  before then, where Ron Paul is just making the argument that he's like, look, they don't the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=386.92s)]
*  terrorists don't hate us because we're rich and we're free. They hate us because we're over there [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=392.68s)]
*  killing so many innocent people and propping up dictators and supporting Israel and their in their [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=397.68s)]
*  ethnic cleansing and domination of the Palestinians and all of this. And, and I thought that was like [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=403.48s)]
*  the most fascinating point ever. And then I got obsessed with reading about it. And in a very [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=408.44s)]
*  similar sense, I've just always been able to understand that while there are these voices that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=413.44s)]
*  will say, well, you know, the real problem is that they hate us because of our freedom, or the real [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=418.88s)]
*  problem is that that Islam is so evil. And you know, whatever, these people are just so sick, or [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=423.36s)]
*  they're just so anti semitic. But if you actually look into, like what's actually happening in any [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=430.28s)]
*  of these situations, one of the, I mean, it's very dark, but in a dark sense, one of the things that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=437.16s)]
*  kind of unites all of us is that you actually realize how much these things unite us. I mean, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=444.12s)]
*  like, we're all kind of the same when it comes to this, like, after 911, we got hit, and some [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  innocent people got killed. And we went, you know what, you hit us, we're gonna go get you. Like, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=457.56s)]
*  if you do that to us, we're gonna, oh, you think you could just kill us? We're gonna go kill a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=466.96s)]
*  whole bunch of you. And then you kind of realize it's like, yeah, that's exactly how those people [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  who flew the buildings into the towers felt. Exactly the same way you feel right now. And I [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=475.44s)]
*  just think that as horrific and evil as Hamas is, and how inexcusable what they did on October 7th [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=480.76s)]
*  was, I think that almost any group of people, if put under the conditions that the Palestinians [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=490.12s)]
*  have been put under, would end up in a very similar place. That, you know, I got, I got, I know you [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=498.4s)]
*  have kids, Glenn, I have kids. And, you know, I was just talking about this on Candace Owen's show [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=504.68s)]
*  the other day when I did one of these debates. It's like, it's not that hard for me to go like, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=510.08s)]
*  what, how would I feel if someone did something like to one of my kids? Then I just, I immediately [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=515.2s)]
*  just see red. I'd immediately just go like, I'd probably join up with the worst, most barbaric [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=522.44s)]
*  group around who felt like we could get some revenge against those people. And I think that's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  what's going on with the Israelis and with the people in Gaza right now. Like, I think it's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=532.76s)]
*  actually what kind of in a weird way unites us. It's a human characteristic that we all have. And [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=538.44s)]
*  I just don't, I think, I think I'm right about this. And I think I understand it. And I'm just [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  not gonna stop talking about that. Because, you know, like I have a little boy and a little girl, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=550.24s)]
*  and particularly because I have a little boy, maybe this is the sexism in me or something like [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  that. But I just go like, what type of example would I be for him? If I, I believed something [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  passionately, but because there's some social pressure to not say it, I'll not say it. No, I [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=567.56s)]
*  have to be a better example than that. And the example I want to be for my son and my daughter [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=573.8s)]
*  too, is, is that no, you tell the truth, even when it might cost you something. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=578.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the main thing about it is, you know, as you said, you can understand these [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  tribal rages. If even if there's reason for it, if your tribe is attacked, and you see suffering in [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=587.88s)]
*  your tribe and all around you, of course, you're going to feel rage to the outsiders who did it [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=595.76s)]
*  instead of thinking rationally about what you might have done to provoke it or what the, the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=600.56s)]
*  problem is that we're supposed to have this kind of global order. That's what the UN was about and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=604.88s)]
*  other things, just responsible leaders who then come in and try and negotiate ways to avoid that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=609.3599999999999s)]
*  tribal rage from exploding into something completely horrific. And in the case of the United [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=614.3599999999999s)]
*  States, and therefore, NATO and others who might have been able to do that, we've done the exact [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=619.8399999999999s)]

*  in order to destroy Gaza. I just a few more questions, a couple more questions, actually, and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=629.92s)]
*  this might be a personal one. But how many security officers and armed guards have you had to hire [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=635.1199999999999s)]
*  since October seven to walk outside your house given this epidemic of anti semitism that has made [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  it unsafe for Jewish people to walk on the streets? Have you been okay? Are you okay? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=647.8s)]
*  You know, I've managed to not hire any so far. And I'm sure this is only because, you know, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=653.88s)]
*  honestly, I feel more concerned about the pro-Israeli protesters or something like that. But [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=660.72s)]
*  I listen, I just hate and I don't particularly like whining from any minority group. I mean, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=670.52s)]
*  look, there are situations where it's totally appropriate if you're being victimized to complain [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=681.44s)]
*  about being victimized. But I have always hated just, you know, as someone who's Jewish and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=686.24s)]
*  this is what I grew up in way before October 7th, I've always just hated passionately the kind of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  like victim complex in the Jewish community. I do understand it to some degree, I think better than [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=702.24s)]
*  most. I understand, you know, my grandfather was a Holocaust survivor. My mother's the first [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=708.32s)]
*  generation after that. And I think from in my parents generation, and certainly in my grandparents [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=713.12s)]
*  generation of Jewish people, there was always this kind of like, they came to get us once, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=721.36s)]
*  this could happen again any moment, we're up against it. It was essentially all of Europe who [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=726.96s)]
*  condoned this, and that Jews always have to be concerned about this. I've always just rejected [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=733.12s)]
*  that as divorced from reality. And I think that my attitude has always been like, look, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=740.72s)]
*  my grandfather grew up in Nazi Germany, he had everything taken from him, including all of his [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=749.52s)]
*  family members, including his father's business, his school, like everything. He barely escaped on [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=756.16s)]
*  a boat he wasn't supposed to be on and got out so he could come here and start a new life. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=763.68s)]
*  And here in this country, he was able to come with nothing, literally nothing except the clothes on [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=769.68s)]
*  his back and come here and start a great life. And a couple generations later, I have never once in my [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  life had a single obstacle put in my way, because I'm Jewish, not one. I may have had a few because [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=783.44s)]
*  I'm white, you know, or considered that, but like, there's definitely been some things in my life [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=792.4000000000001s)]
*  where like, if you were like a minority, a different minority, it may have been helpful to get this [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  position. But even that I don't care about. But there's never been one opportunity denied to me [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  because I was Jewish and someone in a powerful position went, we're not given this opportunity [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=812.0s)]
*  to a Jew. That's just never happened. And like, what am I supposed to do? Pretend that's happened? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=817.04s)]
*  The truth is that Jewish people are around 2% of the United States of America. They are [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=821.76s)]
*  exceptionally successful. I do not at all think there's anything wrong with that, like as I was [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=828.72s)]
*  saying to you before, I'm a libertarian. I don't think there's a problem in inequality. And I don't [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=837.6s)]
*  think there's a problem in one group being very successful, as long as they're doing that through [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=842.0s)]
*  legitimate means and not, you know, like coercive means. But I just hate, I hate the kind of victim [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=847.36s)]
*  ideology. And, you know, since October 7th, I'm not saying there's been, there have been, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=857.2s)]
*  there's some people who kind of like hate Jews. I see the comments on Twitter and stuff like that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=864.32s)]
*  There's been some chants at some of these protests that I'm like, I'm a little uncomfortable with [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=869.12s)]
*  that chant. And I wish they would say something different. But I just think like, to pretend [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=873.84s)]
*  that the objection to what Israel's been doing over the last eight months must all be reduced [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=880.32s)]
*  down to people just secretly hate Jews, I think is ridiculous. And particularly when the protests [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  are being led by so many left wingers in America, where look to all of these people, the worst thing [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=894.4s)]
*  in the world you could be, what's the worst name they could call you, Glenn? What's the name they [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=901.84s)]
*  call Donald Trump or they call all the people they hate? Nazi. Nazi is the worst thing you can be [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=906.16s)]
*  called. I just don't believe that these people are animated by a hatred of Jews. I think what [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=911.6s)]
*  they're animated by, and perhaps they're somewhat animated by a hatred of the more western [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=918.0s)]
*  civilization attacking a more, you know what I mean? Like there might be some of that. There's [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=926.8000000000001s)]
*  some oppressor versus oppressed kind of narrative in there. But I think mostly it's just that [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  they're seeing images of babies being pulled out of rubble every day. Day after day. Day after day. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=938.72s)]
*  Yeah, who wouldn't be ready to protest that? I mean, just look for the simplest explanation. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=945.76s)]
*  And that seems to be it. And I wish, I'm sure you do too, I was heartbroken over the evaporation of [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=952.48s)]
*  the anti-war left during Barack Obama. And I was heartbroken that it didn't return under Donald [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=962.8s)]
*  Trump. And I wish the left wing kids had been out protesting the war in Libya and Syria and Somalia [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=968.7199999999999s)]
*  and Yemen and the drone bombing campaign in Pakistan and Obama's surge in Afghanistan. I wish [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=980.4s)]
*  all of that stuff had drawn the level of outrage that George W. Bush's war in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=987.2s)]
*  drew. And so yeah, they're kind of back now, which is a little bit of an awkward feeling, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=994.4000000000001s)]
*  because you're kind of like, yeah, where you guys been? I've been waiting for you guys. But at the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1001.5200000000001s)]
*  same time to say the reason they're back is just because they hate Jewish people so much. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1006.08s)]
*  There's no evidence for that. It just doesn't seem right at all. It seems more like this [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1012.96s)]
*  is just the most blatant example of something that is so horrifically wrong. And even they can see that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1017.12s)]
*  We know I have to say on this, I mean, this has been something that I have probably focused on [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1024.32s)]
*  almost more than anything else since October 7th. It has been driving me genuinely mad in both senses [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1027.84s)]
*  of the word mad. Because I have a very similar trajectory to you. I had a grandmother who fled [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1035.36s)]
*  Nazi Germany in the late 1930s with her younger sister. And both of them came to the United States [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1042.16s)]
*  and the rest of their family stayed and they were all killed in concentration camps. I was steeped [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1048.4s)]
*  with the idea that Jews have been persecuted throughout history, which is true, including with [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1053.44s)]
*  the Holocaust. But you know, I have to say the thing, and there's a lot of things that have been [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1057.28s)]
*  raging me about the hypocrisy of sort of the pro-Israel right and this kind of anti-woe crowd [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1062.16s)]
*  about when it comes to free speech. They seem to not care about it that much anymore. They find [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1067.44s)]
*  reasons to celebrate censorship. They use this kind of safety narrative for colleges, etc, etc. All [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1071.92s)]
*  the things they've been heaping scorn on. But the thing that has made me the angriest about it is, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1077.04s)]
*  you know, I've lived in the United States for 38 years. I lived from the first 38 years of my life [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1080.96s)]
*  as a Jew. Every member of my family is a Jew. Almost every friend with whom I grew up as a Jew. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1085.28s)]
*  And not only can I say that in those 38 years, I have never once experienced an anti-Semitic attack [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1089.76s)]
*  or assault or feeling like I was discriminated against or even an anti-Semitic comment. I don't [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1097.2s)]
*  know a single Jew that I know who are all around the United States who can say that they have either. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1101.84s)]
*  And that isn't to say, as you said, that there's not some anti-Semitism. Of course there is, and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1107.84s)]
*  there always has been. But there's also a lot of anti-black racism. That really is true. There's [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1112.48s)]
*  anti-Muslim racism. There's anti-immigrant hatred. There is hatred against trans people of the type [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1117.92s)]
*  that can be dangerous. And every single time those narratives were raised by other groups, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1123.76s)]
*  the consensus reaction of the American right or the pro-Israel right and the kind of anti-woe crowd [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1129.6s)]
*  that, you know, branded itself so lucratively was, oh, this is just whiny victimhood. This is just [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1134.96s)]
*  people trying to claim that, you know, everyone is against them and everyone hates them. And now to [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1140.24s)]
*  watch those same people do exactly the same thing on behalf of a group that, as you say, is doing [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1145.76s)]
*  very, very, very well in the United States and always has been, and there's no evidence that [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1153.6s)]
*  they're unsafe in any way, has really kind of sickened me. All right, let me ask you just as a [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1158.0s)]
*  final question. Go ahead. Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead. What's so crazy about it, right, is that [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1163.1999999999998s)]
*  at least for, say, like black Americans, like there is a real issue. Now we could debate forever [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1169.6799999999998s)]
*  what exactly is causing this and what exactly is the solution to this. But like everybody in, say, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1178.08s)]
*  I'm sure you've before in your life, you've taken the Amtrak from New York to D.C. I could just tell [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1184.32s)]
*  you every powerful person on media or in the political class has taken that Amtrak ride before [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1190.32s)]
*  from New York to D.C. If you go sit in the first class of Xcel'a, you're going to see like powerful [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1196.48s)]
*  people on that train ride. And go look out your window when you pass the Baltimore station. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1203.28s)]
*  Just look out your window. It is a nightmare that you look out at. Like every other building is [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1209.44s)]
*  condemned. There's little kids out with no shoes on. It's just like a level of poverty. It's like [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1216.08s)]
*  a third world culture, a third world country right before you get to the Capitol. And it is [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1222.56s)]
*  overwhelmingly black people who are living there. So I'm not saying it's as simple as like you could [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1228.72s)]
*  blame that on systemic racism or just some term that is like ill-defined. But there at least is a [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1233.9199999999998s)]
*  problem. You'd go like, hey, what's going on here? Like what's leading to this? With Jews, there's [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1240.3999999999999s)]
*  just no such thing as that. It just doesn't matter. And then to see, like I was just watching the [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1246.6399999999999s)]
*  other day at that monk debate, Douglas Murray opening up with his whole lecture about how [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1251.04s)]
*  anti-Semitism is a shape shifting virus. And anyone who's criticizing Israel today, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1257.6s)]
*  this is just a different version of supporting pogroms or supporting the Holocaust. And you're [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1263.76s)]
*  like, dude, this is so much weaker than the dumbest woke argument about how basically, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1268.9599999999998s)]
*  you know, like this is slavery and Jim Crow is the same thing as we have today. It's the same [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1277.36s)]
*  argument except much weaker. Exactly. Exactly. And I mean, all you've heard from the right over [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1283.04s)]
*  the last 10 years is you call everybody racist as soon as you disagree with them. What happens in [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1289.6s)]
*  a Israel debate? They immediately call you an anti-Semite. The idea that you scoff at claims [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1293.76s)]
*  of discrimination from groups that are obviously doing far less than Jews, as you said, like black [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1299.04s)]
*  people, like immigrants who are legal immigrants, like Muslims, a whole range of people. And the [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1303.12s)]
*  rights reaction has been, oh, stop whining, stop complaining. And then the minute, you know, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1309.12s)]
*  some Jewish student feels uncomfortable at Harvard, they literally convene congressional hearings [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1314.8s)]
*  after mocking this whole safety as a narrative to say, oh, here are a bunch of Harvard students [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1320.6399999999999s)]
*  who don't feel safe because people are chanting pro-Palestinian quotes. I mean, the hypocrisy of [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1324.8s)]
*  it really, it has been sickening to observe. Thanks for watching this [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QBzMQSx3cM&t=1330.7199999999998s)]
