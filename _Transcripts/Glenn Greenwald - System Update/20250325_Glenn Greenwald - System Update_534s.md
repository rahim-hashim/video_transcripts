# RFK Jr.'s Shocking "MAHA" Pronouncement
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ)
*  Now I just want to make one last point which is that RFK Jr., who I had on my show when [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  he was a candidate running for the Democratic primary and whose health agenda I was largely [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=14.68s)]
*  supportive of, got into office the Secretary of Health and Human Services and I was a strong [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=23.6s)]
*  advocate for his confirmation and he had an agenda called Make America Healthy Again and there was [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=34.04s)]
*  a long list of important and impressive but difficult achievements he hoped to accomplish [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=39.88s)]
*  things like combating chronic disease among Americans and child obesity, waging war on the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=47.36s)]
*  regulatory capture by Big Pharma and Big Ag, forcing the removal of dangerous additives in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=56.64s)]
*  the American food supply that don't exist anywhere else, re-examining and subjecting to much greater [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=66.4s)]
*  scrutiny certain medications that have been approved by a process that was sketchy because [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=73.96s)]
*  of the way in which the pharmaceutical company Big Pharma, the whole agenda encouraging more [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=79.44s)]
*  exercise, make America healthy again. Earlier today here's what RFK Jr., the Secretary of Health and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=85.44s)]
*  Human Services, posted, quote, anti-Semitism like racism is a spiritual and moral malady that, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=95.8s)]
*  I'm sorry, this was not today. This was, I don't know if you have the date for this, but this was [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=103.8s)]
*  last month, this was one of the first things he tweeted as Health and Human Services Secretary. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=111.84s)]
*  He said this, quote, anti-Semitism like racism is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  and kills people with lethalities comparable to history's most deadly plagues. In recent years, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=123.68s)]
*  this censorship and false narratives of low cancel culture have transformed our great [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=129.08s)]
*  universities into greenhouses for this deadly and virulent pestilence. Making America healthy means [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=133.68s)]
*  building communities of trust and mutual respect based on speech freedom and open debate. Such an [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  Arvallian post because the way the Trump administration is dealing with what they call anti-Semitism on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=147.44s)]
*  college campuses, trying to eliminate bigotry as though that can be done just like Democrats tried [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=153.28s)]
*  to eliminate racism and are doing so by forcing universities to implement much more rigid speech [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=157.92s)]
*  codes, much more expanded definitions of anti-Semitism that outlaw a whole variety of common critiques of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=163.32s)]
*  Israel. For RFK Jr. to define that as an advancement of free speech and battling censorship on college [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=169.68s)]
*  campus when it actually is censorship on college campus was unbelievably ironic, but the fact that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=178.44s)]
*  one of the first public announcements he made as Secretary of Health and Human Services had nothing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=183.16s)]
*  to do with the Make America Healthy agenda that I just described. He spoke volumes and then he went back to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=189.64s)]
*  X earlier today to make an announcement again not about childhood obesity or chronic disease or big ag or [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=198.16s)]
*  anything. This is what he said instead. Instead of inspiring universal condemnation, the October 7th [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=207.56s)]
*  Holocaust, he's called October 7th, the October 7th Holocaust, what's happening in Gaza is not a Holocaust, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=213.92s)]
*  but what happened in Gaza is not a Holocaust, but what happened on October 7th is, he says instead of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  inspiring universal condemnation, the October 7th Holocaust triggered a global wave of anti-Semitism. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=227.68s)]
*  Ivy League campuses became a greenhouse for poison. President Trump has ordered his cabinet to use every [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=234.32s)]
*  constitutional tool to uproot this divisive weed. I'm glad Columbia has agreed to this first step and will [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=240.48s)]
*  begin to restore itself as a garden of tolerance, reason, compassion, and respect. Now again, one of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=246.76s)]
*  the things Columbia was forced to agree to was to adopt a radically expanded definition of anti-Semitism, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=254.04s)]
*  the kind that they already have adopted in the EU that prevents you from saying Israel is a racist endeavor. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=259.6s)]
*  You can say that about the United States or China or Peru or any other country in the world, just not about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel. You're not allowed to observe that certain American Jews like say Ben Shapiro or Barry Weiss, just [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=270.76000000000005s)]
*  to pick two random examples, seem to have greater loyalty to Israel than United States. That's one of the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=276.8s)]
*  things that's now borrowed as anti-Semitism to say. You're not allowed to criticize Israel in a way that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=281.84s)]
*  suggests you're applying a double standard to it, meaning you criticize Israel but don't hold other [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=289.64s)]
*  countries to that too as anti-Semitism. You're not allowed to compare what the Israeli government is doing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=294.76s)]
*  to the crimes of the Nazis, even though the whole purpose of the Nuremberg trials was to use that as a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=300.76s)]
*  historical precedent to blow the whistle and to alert people to similar crimes. That is not allowed. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=306.28s)]
*  You can say that about the United States. You can say the United States are acting like Nazis. You can say [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=312.11999999999995s)]
*  the Russians are. You can say the Ukrainians are. You can say the British are. Pick whatever country you want. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=316.67999999999995s)]
*  Say that about them. Feel free. Have a party. Calling it racist, comparing it to just not this one country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  That you are not allowed to do because now the Trump administration is implying, demanding the application [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=329.08s)]
*  of more rigid speech codes to protect a particular minority and to eliminate bigotry after mocking the left [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=335.64s)]
*  and Democrats and liberals for doing exactly that for every other single minority group for a full decade. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=341.4s)]
*  But it just shows you the obsession of the US government on this single foreign country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=346.36s)]
*  I mean it's one thing for Marco Rubio to do it or like Elise Stefanik to do it or national security officials [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  to do it. It's still kind of weird that they're so obsessed with Israel but at least they're like talking about [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=359.4s)]
*  their actual jobs. RFK is the Health and Human Services Secretary. He excited so many people based on an agenda [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=365.24s)]
*  having to do with American health. And twice now of the very few public pronouncements he's made, it's both been about [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=372.6s)]
*  anti-Semitism on college campuses, the need to curb it, and October 7th holocaust. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=380.28s)]
*  At some point, I mean it's already happening, but at some point Americans are going to really start asking [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=389.88s)]
*  why does Israel play such a vital central role? Why is the US government constantly talking about it? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=395.0s)]
*  Why is it sending billions of dollars a year to that foreign country? Why are they making special rules [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=400.2s)]
*  just for this one group of people and just of that foreign country? If you're worried about anti-Semitism, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=405.56s)]
*  this is what's going to fuel it. Telling people that they're now outlawed from criticizing Israel, telling [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=411.0s)]
*  them that they're not allowed to talk about Israel, that everything they question or every criticism [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  they raise is anti-Semitic, telling them they have to send billions and billions of dollars a year to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=421.16s)]
*  Israel even after the Trump administration and the MAGA movement was all about let's stop giving our [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  money to foreign countries and keep it here and spend it on our own country's welfare. At some point [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=431.72s)]
*  that's going to be realized. It already is the approval rating for Israel at its lowest point [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=435.88000000000005s)]
*  ever in the history of Gallup polling. We showed you that two weeks ago. And to watch even these kind [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=440.12s)]
*  of ancillary cabinet members in the Trump administration of nothing to do with foreign policy [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=448.68s)]
*  continuously make pronouncements to serve Israel and show how concerned they are about it [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=454.36s)]
*  is just further fueling the fire that's going to lead to people, rightfully so, asking why this [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=462.12s)]
*  foreign country has such a grave hold on our politics on a bipartisan basis and why it is that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=467.0s)]
*  even every day you turn the internet you see them blowing up children, blowing up journalists, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=475.48s)]
*  blowing up buildings, destroying all of society, occupying multiple countries, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=480.44s)]
*  bombing multiple countries, all with American weapons and American money. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=484.68s)]
*  Why it is that the United States is so blindly devoted to this foreign country and why American [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=490.12s)]
*  politicians seem to have a much greater willingness to criticize our own government [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=500.04s)]
*  than this foreign government on the other side of the world. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuGrFGv9GxQ&t=504.2s)]
