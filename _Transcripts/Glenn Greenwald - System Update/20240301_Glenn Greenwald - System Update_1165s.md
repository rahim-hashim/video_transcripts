# Bari Weiss & TIME Unveil New Antisemitism/Neocon Victim Narrative
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE)
*  One of the things that has been done since October 7th in order to rejuvenate this idea [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=0.0s)]
*  among Americans that they need to be fighting wars all over the country, including wars [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=11.0s)]
*  that aren't ours, that aren't against enemies attacking the United States, is to use October [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=16.5s)]
*  7th to say that there is a new bigotry consuming the United States. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=23.16s)]
*  There is a new special victim group that once again has become the vulnerable group of race [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=28.58s)]
*  with vulnerable to racism and the like and that is American Jews. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=36.72s)]
*  And then combined with that is an argument that we need to be supporting Israel and that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=41.099999999999994s)]
*  anyone who questions that or anyone who opposes what Israel is doing is probably guilty of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=45.22s)]
*  this new anti-Semitism. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=52.099999999999994s)]
*  You can tell there's a lot of power behind this mentality even though they're trying [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=55.94s)]
*  to claim that they're a marginalized group, that they're in danger in the United States, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=60.3s)]
*  they appear in every one of the most influential and powerful platforms to make this case. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=64.54s)]
*  And just this week there is a cover story in Time Magazine which obviously is not the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=71.2s)]
*  same Time Magazine as it once was. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=76.42s)]
*  It was probably the most influential media outlet during the Cold War, even into the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=78.38s)]
*  80s and 90s. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=82.58s)]
*  But it still packs a lot of punch, it still carries a heavy brand name for a lot of people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=85.18s)]
*  and particularly the Time cover is something that a lot of people see. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=91.34s)]
*  Time Magazine is now owned by a pro-Israel billionaire. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  The editor in chief is also a fanatical pro-Israel long time journalist who I think you can safely [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=101.84s)]
*  describe as neocon. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=108.9s)]
*  And this week they released this new cover story that is attracting a lot of attention [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  and it's written by Noah Feldman who was kind of a classic neocon during the Bush-Cheney [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=117.4s)]
*  years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  He was actually part of what was called the provisional government in Iraq, the one that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  the Bush and Cheney put into Iraq during the invasion to try and control what that government [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=127.56s)]
*  would be which was ultimately the purpose of the invasion of Iraq. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=133.16s)]
*  Noah Feldman was actually part of that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=135.8s)]
*  He's not a very obvious figure to be a representative of a marginalized and oppressed group because [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=139.48s)]
*  he has basically had the most elite life possible. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=146.4s)]
*  He went to Harvard and Yale Law School, he went to Oxford, he's taught on the Harvard [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=150.2s)]
*  Law School faculty forever, he's been a celebrated intellectual, he was part of the Bush-Cheney [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=156.92s)]
*  government, he became one of the leading witnesses in support of the first Trump impeachment [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=161.2s)]
*  and he has access to the cover story of Time magazine to write an article saying that his [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=169.24s)]
*  own group, American Jews, are a uniquely victimized group and essentially that they are victimized [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=175.52s)]
*  by a new kind of anti-Semitism that basically includes anyone questioning US support for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=183.28s)]
*  the war in Israel or questioning the Israeli government in any sort of a harsh way. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=191.12s)]
*  This is a now celebrated time cover. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  There you see, Me Wieder ist Jetzt, which is German for I believe Never Again is Now, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=201.0s)]
*  Never Again is Now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  And you see the star David there and then the headline is the new anti-Semitism. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=213.0s)]
*  So obviously using German, it's intended to evoke this kind of very alarming iconography [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=219.4s)]
*  and it's essentially arguing that there is a new radical anti-Semitism in the United [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  States that is rendering American Jews, despite all their apparent power, the fact that they [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=231.88s)]
*  have been extremely safe in the United States and continue to be in my view for reasons [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=236.84s)]
*  we've gone over many times, but this is an attempt to say that new anti-Semitism has [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=241.64s)]
*  arisen since October 7th and is based in opposition to Israel, which means if you're a critic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=247.0s)]
*  of Israel, you're likely guilty of this new anti-Semitism. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=250.72s)]
*  Here's some of the article, quote, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=254.68s)]
*  In the months following Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, anti-Semitic incidents [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=255.84s)]
*  increased substantially. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=262.0s)]
*  The Anti-Defamation League, which I guess a lot of people trust now, didn't trust at [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=263.24s)]
*  all until October 7th, but now do, which keeps track, said they tripled in the US over the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=268.84s)]
*  previous year, although its criteria also changed to include anti-Zionism. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=273.8s)]
*  In other words, there's an expanded definition of anti-Semitism by the ADL that if you say [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=280.44000000000005s)]
*  something that the ADL interprets as anti-Zionist, they will count that as an anti-Semitic act. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=286.44000000000005s)]
*  The core of this new anti-Zionism lies in the idea that Jews are not a historically [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  oppressed people seeking self-preservation, but are instead oppressors, imperialists, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  colonialists, and even white supremacists. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=302.64s)]
*  Now Noah Feldman was part of the Iraq War. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  He was part of the attempt to impose on Iraq a government by the United States. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=310.28s)]
*  He is a vehement supporter of the war in Gaza. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=314.84s)]
*  He is a vehement supporter of Israel. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  If you call him an imperialist or an oppressor or you look at his lineage and his very privileged [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  life and deny that he's a victim, then according to him, you are guilty of this new anti-Semitism. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=327.6s)]
*  Quote, this view preserves vestiges of the trope that Jews exercise vast power. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  It creatively updates the narrative to contemporary circumstances and current cultural preoccupations [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  with the nature of power and injustice. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  Israel the first Jewish state to exist in two millennial plays a central role in the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=351.16s)]
*  narrative of the new anti-Semitism. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=354.68s)]
*  While a well-meaning person free of anti-Semitism could describe Israel as colonialist, the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=357.56s)]
*  narrative of Israel as a settler colonial oppressor on par with or worse than the U.S. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=362.2s)]
*  candidate in Australia is fundamentally misleading. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=367.0s)]
*  Those who advance it run the risk of perpetuating anti-Semitism by condemning the Jewish state [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=370.88s)]
*  despite its basic differences from those other global examples. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=376.56s)]
*  Most importantly, Israel's status as the only homeland for historically oppressed people [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=380.04s)]
*  who have nowhere else to call their own. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=384.8s)]
*  To emphasize the narrative of Jews as oppressors, the new anti-Semitism must also somehow sidestep [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  not only two millennia of Jewish oppression but also the Holocaust, the largest organized [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=394.16s)]
*  institutionalized murder of any ethnic group in human history. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=398.04s)]
*  On the right, anti-Semites either deny the Holocaust, ever happened, or claim its scope [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=402.36s)]
*  has been overstated. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  How big of a group is that of people on the right who deny the Holocaust or revise the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=409.92s)]
*  Holocaust? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=415.48s)]
*  On the left, he says, one line is that Jews are weaponizing the Holocaust to legitimize [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=416.48s)]
*  the oppression of Palestinians. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=421.22s)]
*  All right, let me just say that's something I believe. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=422.6s)]
*  I believe that the ADL and a lot of pro-Israel organizations weaponize the Holocaust to shield [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=426.72s)]
*  Israel from valid critiques. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  The idea that that makes you an anti-Semite to believe that or to criticize Israel or [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=439.44s)]
*  to question Israel or to question whether Jews are a unique victim group in the United [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=444.12s)]
*  States, the idea that any of that is anti-Semitic is obviously unbelievably manipulative. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=448.28s)]
*  Probably the biggest grievance of people on the American right, of conservatives in the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=456.68s)]
*  United States about the left, has been that the left uses identity politics, they weaponize [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=460.68s)]
*  racism accusations in order to stifle debate, to destroy the reputations of anybody who [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=467.08s)]
*  agrees with them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=472.24s)]
*  What is this if not that? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=473.24s)]
*  Accusing everybody who disagrees with Noah Feldman on Israel of being part of the new [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=477.44s)]
*  anti-Semitism, of saying that anybody who rejects the idea that American Jews require [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=482.28s)]
*  special privileges in the United States is guilty of the new anti-Semitism, this is exactly [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=487.76s)]
*  everything the American right has claimed that they hate. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=493.68s)]
*  Accusing people who disagree with you of being racist, weaponizing bigotry accusations [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=496.88s)]
*  to stifle debate, this is all this is in its most blatant form. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=500.6s)]
*  Quote, during the Gaza war some have argued that Israel having suffered the trauma of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=505.0s)]
*  the Holocaust is now itself perpetuating a genocide against the Palestinian people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=509.88s)]
*  Accusing Israel of genocide can function intentionally or otherwise as a way of erasing the memory [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=516.2s)]
*  of the Holocaust and transforming Jews from victims into oppressors. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=521.48s)]
*  If that's not an argument to demonize everybody who questions Israel as an anti-Semite, then [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=528.2s)]
*  I've never seen that before. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=535.24s)]
*  It is that flagrantly, explicitly. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=536.6s)]
*  And as for the question of whether American Jews are victims and whether you can question [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=540.96s)]
*  whether they are, let's look at who Noah Feldman is. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=546.52s)]
*  Here is his official biography from Harvard Law School where he teaches. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=551.12s)]
*  Noah Feldman is the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=556.12s)]
*  Felix Frankfurter, by the way, is one of the most influential Supreme Court justices of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=559.88s)]
*  the 20th century. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=565.12s)]
*  He was Jewish, like many American Supreme Court justices throughout the 20th century. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=566.12s)]
*  And Noah Feldman is the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, the Chairman of the Society of Fellows [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=572.8s)]
*  and the founding director of the Julius Rabbanowitz Program on Jewish and Israeli Law, all at [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=576.9s)]

*  She quit the New York Times in protest of a lot of critiques she had of that paper that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=658.94s)]
*  I shared. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=665.7s)]
*  She then created her own media outlet, Substack, where it's producing many millions of dollars [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=667.74s)]
*  to great financial success. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=674.32s)]
*  It's a hugely supported website. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=676.34s)]

*  She has access to every major platform. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=686.18s)]

*  wealthy supporters of Israel attended. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=697.0s)]
*  Very hard to depict Barry Weiss as well, a graduate of Columbia, as some sort of a marginalized [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=700.0999999999999s)]
*  victim in the United States. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=707.0799999999999s)]
*  She too was here to argue, not for the first time, that American Jews are uniquely vulnerable [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=710.46s)]
*  in the United States, that American Jews are endangered actually, and that one of the manifestations [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=717.3000000000001s)]
*  of this anti-Semitism that American Jews are endangered by is the criticism of Israel, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=723.82s)]
*  the questioning of whether or not the United States should fight not only in Israel but [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=729.1s)]
*  also for Ukraine and in general, just the neocon worldview that the United States should [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=732.5400000000001s)]
*  be involved in multiple wars around the world. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=738.26s)]
*  The irony of her speech is that the 92nd Street Y had invited the Pulitzer Prize-winning author [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=741.02s)]
*  who was critical of Israel and yet canceled his speech because he was a critic of Israel [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=749.44s)]
*  and instead invited Barry Weiss to come and speak instead, just to give you kind of a [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=755.1s)]
*  sense for who victims are, who is repressed in the United States and who isn't. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=759.3000000000001s)]
*  And here's part of what Barry Weiss said in outlining our foreign policy, what this new [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=764.6s)]
*  anti-Semitism is and what all of our obligations are when it comes to Israel. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=767.8000000000001s)]
*  The world is changing. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=771.4s)]
*  The world that so many of us were born into, the world that we thought we were going to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=774.72s)]
*  get our lives inside, that world is done. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=779.5600000000001s)]
*  There's no going back to it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  And the things that we took for granted, that America would always remain exceptional, not [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=787.3000000000001s)]
*  just for us but for the world, and that Americans themselves would understand this as a place [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=792.88s)]
*  and as an idea worth fighting for, those are no longer certainties. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=798.2800000000001s)]
*  Nor is the certainty of the free world itself, which is burning right now at its outer edges. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=804.32s)]
*  All of it, the ideals and the architecture that have made the past 75 years of Jewish [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=812.12s)]
*  life the greatest in the history of the world. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  Next up for grabs, ask the people of southern Israel who saw on the morning of October 7th [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=822.76s)]
*  how brittle is the fence that separates civilization from barbarism? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=830.08s)]
*  So there you see that framework. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=836.0s)]
*  Israel is the civilized part of the world. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=838.72s)]
*  The Palestinians are the barbaric, the savages, the subhumans. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=841.9s)]
*  And the fact that Israel, which occupies lands that belong to it only since 1948, displaced [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=849.54s)]
*  a lot of Arabs from that land, that chooses to occupy the West Bank illegally in the eyes [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=858.02s)]
*  of the world, that blockades Gaza in all the ways that we've described and that was bombing [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=863.0799999999999s)]
*  Gaza, the fact that Israel can be attacked by a much weaker group of people that they're [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=866.78s)]
*  now obliterating, somehow is supposed to mean that American Jews in the United States [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=873.14s)]
*  are also endangered and that if you question this war in any way, you are part of the opposition [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=879.86s)]
*  to the defense of the free world. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=888.98s)]
*  If you question the war in Ukraine, you're part of this movement that is undermining [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=890.5s)]
*  the defense of the free world. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=895.02s)]
*  The only way you can be part of the defense of the free world, according to Barry Weiss, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=896.66s)]
*  and the only way you can be relieved of the accusation of anti-Semitism is if you cheer [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=899.9000000000001s)]
*  for American wars, all the ones that she supports, including in Ukraine but also, most importantly, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=906.1800000000001s)]
*  supporting the war in Israel. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=913.5400000000001s)]
*  Ask the people of Taiwan who hear Beijing's threats and wonder how soon the dark shadow [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=916.34s)]
*  that has fallen over Hong Kong might consume them too. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=922.5400000000001s)]
*  Ask the people of Ukraine. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=928.02s)]
*  Ask the Navalny family. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=931.22s)]
*  In one of the beautiful and haunting letters that Alexei Navalny sent from a prison cell [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=934.1s)]
*  in the Arctic Circle to Natan Sharansky in Jerusalem, he wrote about how strange it was [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=939.8s)]
*  to be reading Sharansky's memoir, Fear No Evil, about his time in the Soviet gulag forty [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=946.26s)]
*  years before. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=952.54s)]
*  I was amused by the fact, he writes, that neither the essence of the system nor the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=955.02s)]
*  pattern of its acts has changed. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=959.66s)]
*  He continued, in the current situation, it is not them who are to blame, he says amazingly [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=963.1s)]
*  of the KGB, and this is the crucial part, it is not them who are to blame but us who [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=970.74s)]
*  naively thought that there was no going back to the old ways. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=978.1s)]
*  So that is the neocon worldview stated perfectly. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=984.38s)]
*  Barry Weiss absolutely has a way with words. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=987.38s)]
*  When she was hired by the New York Times, it was exactly at the same time that the New [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=989.3s)]
*  York Times had hired Bret Stevens and liberals were indignant about the hiring of Bret Stevens. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=993.1s)]
*  He was a climate denier and all these other bad things. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=997.82s)]
*  And I wrote an article saying, actually Barry Weiss is the much more consequential hire. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1001.38s)]
*  I knew that she was a very shrewd and savvy media operator. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1005.66s)]
*  And I knew she was going to have this kind of an influence. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1010.94s)]
*  What she's saying is a very pernicious but effective message, which is, if you want to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1012.94s)]
*  be on the side of good and you want to avoid being someone who's a threat to American Jews, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1019.1400000000001s)]
*  you need to step up and cheer for American wars in all these places. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1027.1000000000001s)]
*  You need to fight China, you need to fight Russia, you need to fight Israel's enemies, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1030.74s)]
*  Iran. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1036.98s)]
*  This is what neocons do. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1038.64s)]
*  This is the way that they get Americans to constantly pay for and cheer for wars that [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1040.7s)]
*  are not in their interest, that have nothing to do with the way of life in the United States [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1045.1000000000001s)]
*  by constantly linking all of Israel's enemies to part of this greater battle that we are [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1051.22s)]
*  all facing between the civilized people, the Americans, Europe, Israel, and all of Israel's [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1057.7s)]
*  Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, Russia, so that we continue to view Israel as our great ally [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1066.22s)]
*  whose military we should pay for, whose wars we should finance, because it's part of our [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1076.26s)]
*  duty to be part of this bigger vision to defend freedom. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1082.38s)]
*  And if you don't think that, if you question whether or not Israel belongs there in that [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1089.18s)]
*  group, if you think that it's not actually in our interest to pay for Israel's wars [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1095.54s)]
*  and to tie ourselves as the hip to Israel and to fight for the war in Ukraine, then [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1098.98s)]
*  you're probably someone who's a coward, unlike Alexei Navalny, the former neo-Nazi that Barry [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1105.46s)]
*  Weiss loves, and the Azov battalion in Ukraine, the current neo-Nazi battalion that Barry [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1112.06s)]
*  Weiss loves, and obviously the people in Israel currently starving the population of Gaza [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h_TcP9YpE&t=1120.34s)]
