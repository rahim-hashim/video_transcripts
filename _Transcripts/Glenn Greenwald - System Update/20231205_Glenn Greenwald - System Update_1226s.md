# Why Is Ireland Erupting? Mass Migration, Hate Speech Laws, & More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o)
*  Alright, so Ben Scallon is an Irish journalist and he's somebody that we began speaking with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=0.0s)]
*  several months ago before these latest riots that took place in Dublin in the wake of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=11.4s)]
*  stabbing because I wanted him to come on the show and talk about this censorship craze [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=15.52s)]
*  that is consuming large parts of the Irish elite and the incredibly draconian bill they're [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=20.16s)]
*  trying to get past that will allow them to punish people for not just expressing but being in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=25.22s)]
*  possession of hate speech defined in that most ambiguous and broadest way possible. And then [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=31.5s)]
*  the riots happened in Ireland and the case picked up and we decided it was really important to have [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=38.3s)]
*  an Irish journalist on to help us understand what's happening in his country in Ireland and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=43.66s)]
*  so we have this Dublin based journalist Ben Scallon he's a great independent journalist [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=48.54s)]
*  whose work I've been following for a while and here is that interview that we taped just a few [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=51.58s)]
*  minutes before we went on air. It's great to see you thanks so much for taking the time to talk to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=55.42s)]
*  us. Thank you so much for having me on it's great to talk to you. Yeah you too so as I said there's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=66.38s)]
*  a lot of attention being paid now to Ireland here in the United States and the West generally [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=73.22s)]
*  because of these recent riots and because of the government's response including seemingly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=77.74s)]
*  wanting to censor even further and I want to talk about the substance of those in a bit but you and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=82.3s)]
*  I were talking about having you come on to talk about events in your country well before that a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=88.06s)]
*  couple months ago I think in part because a lot of this has been brewing all year so before we get [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=93.58s)]
*  the recent events I remember hearing the Irish government complaining pretty bitterly back in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=99.14s)]
*  February the beginning of this year about what they called an exponential increase in protests [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=104.34s)]
*  and suggesting more controls on speech were needed to respond to that what were these protests all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=109.9s)]
*  about throughout this year before we had the most recent one and in the wake of that stabbing. Yeah [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  so Ireland has seen an unprecedented number of protests regarding mass immigration in the past [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  year or so and that's been an issue that's been kind of burgeoning on the agenda for quite a few [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=130.10000000000002s)]
*  years but it has really accelerated I would say since the start of 2022 with the advent of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=136.02s)]
*  the war in Ukraine and the fact that there's been a huge influx of people to Western Europe from other [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=144.38s)]
*  parts of the world due to these kinds of conflicts and so Ireland for our part being a small island [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=154.46s)]
*  you know the Republic of Ireland has a population of just about five million people we've taken in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=160.82000000000002s)]
*  a hundred thousand individuals from Ukraine and many more from other parts of the world which is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=165.58s)]
*  obviously a huge proportion of our population there are towns and villages all up and down the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  west coast of this country which about their population of more than doubled by this process [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=175.02s)]
*  and so that's going to give anybody whiplash you know regardless of what your thoughts are on [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=181.66s)]
*  immigration in general that's a huge number and so there have been a lot of people across this [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=186.5s)]
*  country in various little communities who have said look this is this is just excessive you know [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=192.98s)]
*  we want to be welcoming we want to help people who are in a difficult situation but within reason [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=198.45999999999998s)]
*  and we can't go overboard and so that's kind of the general sentiment behind this this protest [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=203.98s)]
*  and that's a new development here because for many years in Ireland mass immigration was seen as a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  sacred cow that was untouchable and unquestionable nobody dared to utter a word against this for a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=215.9s)]
*  fear of being labeled an ist or a foe or any of the other kinds of smear words that are labeled [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=222.01999999999998s)]
*  whenever you tried to approach this topic from an adult direction and so that's that's basically [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=227.5s)]
*  the state of play here in Ireland for the past year or so but that's really interesting because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=234.18s)]
*  of course in every country where there's a debate over immigration the people who are in favor of I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=237.94s)]
*  guess mass immigration or who stand opposed to imposing any limits as long as usually their [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=243.3s)]
*  communities aren't the one having to bear the brunt of it will accuse the people who do want [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=250.38s)]
*  limits or are concerned about it as you said of being racist or xenophobic all of those accusations [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=256.26s)]
*  that come immediately flowing against anyone who's just saying no I'm in favor of being welcoming [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=262.14s)]
*  it's just it's too much we don't have the resources to assimilate people and endure it one of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=266.3s)]
*  things I think is so interesting in what you said and what's happening in Ireland is usually when [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=271.58s)]
*  people hear about immigration debates in Europe or in the United States but especially in Europe I [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=275.14s)]
*  think people think about immigration from the Middle East from Northern Africa and from places [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  like that and yet one of the triggering events in this case one of the kind of things that pushed [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=287.1s)]
*  it over the edge seems to be this flow of immigrants from Ukraine what is it that the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=291.78s)]
*  Irish government did in terms of allowing or calling for immigrants from Ukraine how many in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  number are there and what kinds of people have these been that has led to people being so upset [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=304.41999999999996s)]
*  about it well I'd say first of all that a lot of the people from Ukraine who have come here are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=309.5s)]
*  perfectly nice normal people there's not any objection to them as individuals I'd say would [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=316.46s)]
*  be the general attitude of the Irish people it really is just a number of numbers they could all [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  be all Canadians and the objection will be the exact same because as I say a hundred thousand [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=326.7s)]
*  people being airdropped into a small country overnight which is essentially what's happened [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=332.7s)]
*  is just an unsustainable influx of the human beings and so I think that's part of the problem [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=338.26s)]
*  the government for their part last year they requested there are they didn't request but they [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=345.5s)]
*  effectively said that Ireland could and would be willing to accept about 200,000 Ukrainian refugees [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=352.5s)]
*  for from the war which will be an enormous undertaking we've taken half of that and it's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=362.18s)]
*  already a total drain on our system which is buckling under the pressure we now have hundreds [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=367.94s)]
*  of asylum seekers who are living in tents in in Ireland in the capital city which is not exactly [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=374.98s)]
*  the red carpet treatment for somebody who's fleeing war that they would come to a cold rainy country [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=381.38s)]
*  in winter only to be put outside and the authorities tell them sorry there's literally nowhere to put [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=386.26s)]
*  you so and this this also part of what's frustrated people about this whole situation is that we've [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  had an ongoing homelessness crisis for years in Ireland there have been about 10,000 homeless [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=396.98s)]
*  people in Dublin and it's been a key election issue for many years and so for the fact that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=401.78s)]
*  there's many people looking at this situation now saying well you couldn't help our own people who [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=407.7s)]
*  are in crisis for a decade but suddenly we have the ability to harbour half the world and everybody [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=412.5s)]
*  who who needs help from abroad to so much so that our minister for integration a couple of years ago [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  before the ukraine war broke out he put out tweets in a variety of different languages arabic [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=425.62s)]
*  french georgian and so on basically outlining the fact that if you come to ireland and seek asylum [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=431.86s)]
*  you'll be given your own door accommodation within four months of your arrival so that is essentially [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=438.9s)]
*  ringing the dinner bell to anybody across the world whether they're a legitimate asylum seeker [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=444.82s)]
*  or not that ireland is the place to be and we're offering all of these great opportunities and so [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=448.9s)]
*  come on in and what do you know the following year we see a massive influx of people so [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=453.86s)]
*  i mean it's uh it's hard to prove that those two things are connected but if you use a common sense [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=459.14s)]
*  you would have to imagine that there is at least some connection there between these two events [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=464.42s)]
*  yeah the government says hey come and people come i think it's a reasonable assumption what's so [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  amazing about it as well though is there's this huge disparity between what these people are [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=473.78000000000003s)]
*  promised and then the reality of what they're being given when they get there they're kind of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  alert to ireland with these nice sentiments and yet the government either isn't willing to or [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=483.38s)]
*  isn't able to find the resources to fulfill those promises that they made to those people and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=488.26s)]
*  encouraging them to come i think one of the things that shows is that there's obviously a strong [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=492.9s)]
*  economic component to concerns about immigration despite the attempt to suggest that it's always [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=497.7s)]
*  about racism or nationalism or selfishness or hostility to people who aren't like the people [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=502.1s)]
*  in that country has there been as part of these protests that the government was complaining [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=509.22s)]
*  about all throughout the year an explicitly economic component or set of issues that also [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=514.98s)]
*  have been driving these protests or has it just been about immigration i think there it's been a [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  variety of things that a big a big component actually which has come up quite a bit is the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=527.38s)]
*  lack of consultation a lot of people have mentioned this quite a bit where they say you know we're not [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=532.82s)]
*  even being asked do you want this to happen the first thing we hear from the government is [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=537.38s)]
*  we get a notice saying oh yeah by the way there's going to be 100 adult men because that's actually [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=542.9s)]
*  one of the other details here that our integration minister has admitted that most of the people [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=547.62s)]
*  coming are single adult males which is not what a lot of people have in mind when they think about [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=553.54s)]
*  a refugee you know you're thinking about women and children and old people and the infirm and that's [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=558.74s)]
*  not to say that men can't seek asylum of course they can but it's a bit unusual when that's the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=563.78s)]
*  bulk of the people fleeing you would expect the numbers to be you know families that's usually [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=570.3399999999999s)]
*  the the thing that springs to mind when you think of helping refugees so a lot of communities now in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=575.9399999999999s)]
*  ireland they hear just overnight oh yeah by the way 100 adult men are going to be moving into this hotel [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=581.4599999999999s)]
*  which is right near your children's school mostly unvetted people that we don't know a lot about [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=587.86s)]
*  because you know many of them don't have documents or papers that might be for reasonable reasons it [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=592.58s)]
*  might not be we don't know and you're just supposed to accept that and in fact they say oh well we're [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=598.1s)]
*  we're consulting with local communities or engaging with them but our t-shock is basically our prime [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=605.38s)]
*  minister he just admitted in the parliament a couple of days ago that when he says engaging [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=610.9s)]
*  what he means is we're giving you the information that you need to accept the new reality of what's [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=616.82s)]
*  happening to you basically so it's not actually a negotiation there's no question that this [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=623.3000000000001s)]
*  isn't going to happen and he explicitly said that no one has a right to veto who lives in their area [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=627.94s)]
*  and who doesn't so you're you're going to have to accept this whether you like it or not really the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=634.74s)]
*  quote-unquote engagement process is just us telling you how it's going to be so that's not [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=639.1400000000001s)]
*  really i think what people had in mind when they sat down at the table in good faith to talk to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=645.94s)]
*  their local representatives yeah um it is a kind of thing again that we're seeing repeating this [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=650.2600000000001s)]
*  huge breach between the ruling elite on the one hand and the people over whom they're ruling [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=656.74s)]
*  on the other they don't get a sense at all that there's a democratic process in effect even though [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=662.5s)]
*  they nominally choose their political leaders one of the things that caused a lot of attention to [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=667.0600000000001s)]
*  be paid to ireland in the united states was this very viral tweet and again this was before [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=672.74s)]
*  the recent stabbing by an algerian refugee to to ireland and the allegedly allegedly i have to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=677.94s)]
*  add that caveat thank you yes allegedly but it's not proven yet right he's not been convicted [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=686.66s)]
*  and the calls the newfound calls for hate speech as i said this has been brewing all year [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=692.34s)]
*  and one of the reasons i know that is because i started paying a lot more attention when ireland [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=696.34s)]
*  started advocating hate speech laws here in brazil they're desperately trying to impose one [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=700.9s)]
*  of the most draconian but the eu the uk canada have all implemented their own laws that allow [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=707.06s)]
*  control over the internet and hate speech in particular and i think one of the things that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=714.1s)]
*  really got a lot of attention was this green party senator paulina riley back in june sort of about [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=718.34s)]
*  five months ago several months before these last riot where she gave a speech that was kind of [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  the caricature of everybody's worst fears about what people who believe in censorship and are [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=729.06s)]
*  calling for censorship really believe she was way too candid in saying what she wanted and let me [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=734.3399999999999s)]
*  just play that for you and then have a couple questions about it when you think about it all [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=740.18s)]
*  law all legislation is about the restriction of freedom that's exactly what we're doing here is [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=744.9s)]
*  we are restricting freedom but we're doing it for the common good you will see throughout our [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=750.5799999999999s)]
*  constitution yes you have rights but they are restricted for the common good everything needs [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=755.54s)]
*  to be balanced and if your views on other people's identities go to make their lives unsafe insecure [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=762.3399999999999s)]
*  and cause them such deep discomfort that they cannot live in peace then i believe that it is [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=772.5799999999999s)]
*  our job as legislators to restrict those freedoms for the common good now what was so stunning about [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=778.74s)]
*  that is she was talking about political speech and the bill she was speaking about or participating [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=784.98s)]
*  in a debate regarding was the criminal justice bill of 2022 which was also called the incitement [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=791.62s)]
*  of violence or hatred and hate offenses first of all did this get a lot of attention in ireland as [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=796.58s)]
*  well a lot of negative attention the way it did in in large parts of the west and secondly what [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=802.9s)]
*  was that bill she was advocating for when saying look of course we're coming to restrict your [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=806.66s)]
*  freedoms yeah so i don't think that piece of video that you just played would have gotten any [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=811.38s)]
*  attention at all if i do say so myself if it wasn't for my publication which is kind of the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=818.74s)]
*  only renegade publication in ireland that's covering this from a critical perspective i [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=824.0999999999999s)]
*  mean some of our papers of record these these time tested newspapers were actually lobbying the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=829.2199999999999s)]
*  government advocating on behalf of the legislation in question and that legislation is a hate speech [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=836.1s)]
*  bill which would have extremely wide-ranging ramifications for this country and it's caught [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=841.62s)]
*  international attention for good reason i mean the primary issue with this legislation from my [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=849.78s)]
*  perspective is the extreme vagueness of it to the point where none of the key words that it uses are [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=855.22s)]
*  actually defined so by that i mean hatred is not even defined in this hate speech bill it says that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=864.26s)]
*  hatred means hatred against people on the basis of x y and z characteristics which is obviously a [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=870.26s)]
*  circular meaningless definition and similarly it says that it wants to protect genders other than [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=876.3399999999999s)]
*  that of male or female but when i asked artishek leo voradkar i said you know how many genders are [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=882.9799999999999s)]
*  there that this would actually cover he said that the government has no official position on that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=889.54s)]
*  which is obviously an absurdity so you could potentially offend somebody who belongs to a [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=893.54s)]
*  gender which the government can't define and they can't even define what hatred is but you're still [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=899.2199999999999s)]
*  going to go to jail for a criminal offense potentially if you're found guilty under this [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=904.3399999999999s)]
*  thing so it is so nebulous and vague to the point where anybody could potentially fall prey to it [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=909.14s)]
*  and that's one of the major concerns that it's caused not just here but across the whole world [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=916.18s)]
*  i want to dive a little bit more into the substance of the the bill as is pending now [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=921.3s)]
*  that the government's really trying to exploit the sentiments over these riots in order to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=924.8199999999999s)]
*  implement before we get to that let me ask you this question which is you know you were saying [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=930.5799999999999s)]
*  this probably wouldn't have gotten a lot of attention in ireland had it not been for your [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=935.2199999999999s)]
*  critical scrutiny of it and your critical promotion of it caused it to viralize as i said in the us [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=939.14s)]
*  and a lot of places in the west because like i said it was just such a i don't think it was a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=944.5s)]
*  rare expression but it was a very blunt expression of what people who advocate censorship really [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=948.66s)]
*  believe one of the things i've lived in brazil now for 18 years and brazil in the last several [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=953.6999999999999s)]
*  years has also increasingly turned to extremely repressive measures to control speech on the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=960.1s)]
*  internet to punish alleged hate speech and has all the same infirmities as what you've been [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=965.6999999999999s)]
*  describing the ambiguity of it who decides what hate speech laws but people not only get banned [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=970.42s)]
*  from the internet but can even get fined and go to prison if they violate these laws [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=974.9s)]
*  and one of the things that really surprised me i guess when it's american is in the united states [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=978.98s)]
*  there are also a lot of people who favor censorship but people will pretend that they don't no one likes [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=982.8199999999999s)]
*  to admit yes i'm in favor of censorship there's a constitutional free speech guarantee it's [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=987.38s)]
*  inculcated as part of the american identity that we will leave in free speech whereas in brazil [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  the term free speech is something that they will just acknowledge widely that they don't believe in [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=997.54s)]
*  they consider almost a fascist value now or a right wing value and the difference isn't really [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1002.98s)]
*  in the attitude but in the kind of norms of what people are allowed to admit that they believe in [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1008.1800000000001s)]
*  brazil they just say i don't believe in free speech at all how is it in ireland i mean is this [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1013.86s)]
*  kind of a speech is the reason you say it would have gotten any notice without you because it's [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1018.1s)]
*  just kind of the norm in ireland to talk about the virtues of censorship or something else about this [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1023.54s)]
*  speech something that would have just evaded attention had you not really promoted it [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1029.7800000000002s)]
*  i think we've got a serious case of ideological capture and group think when it comes to our [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1036.18s)]
*  major institutions i don't think the irish public are in support of this kind of thing in fact i [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1042.26s)]
*  know they're not our most recent polling on this subject which was done a couple of years ago [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1047.46s)]
*  where a major polling company asked the public do you believe that people should be allowed to say [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1053.7s)]
*  offensive things do you believe that hate speech laws should be on the books and the vast majority [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1058.18s)]
*  of people said no moreover when the government themselves held a public consultation i think in [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1062.3400000000001s)]
*  america it's called a comment period where you ask the public before you do something hey what do [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1069.38s)]
*  you think of this they received thousands of responses in reply and i went through every [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1074.5800000000002s)]
*  single one of those and i categorized them all by whether they were positive or negative and in a [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1080.5s)]
*  story that my publication ran earlier this year we revealed that 73 percent of the responses to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1086.18s)]
*  the government's own public consultation were negative so that's obviously an overwhelming [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1092.3400000000001s)]
*  majority the public clearly aren't buying this and yet they're driving ahead with it anyway [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1097.7s)]
*  despite having no mandate so i think there's a real disconnect between the general public and the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1101.6200000000001s)]
*  journalists and the politicians and the academics and the ngo's and these sorts of elite groups if [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1108.3400000000001s)]
*  you want to put it that way who are all in a little club together and think alike and act alike [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1114.26s)]
*  and then you go to the ordinary person on the street and they don't want anything to do with [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1120.42s)]
*  this i mean you think about the character of ireland historically a lot of stereotypes are true [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1123.86s)]
*  as far as us being a pugilistic people who like to fight there's you know a lot of truth is set in [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1130.34s)]
*  jett that it would be very hard to shut up an irish person who had a strong opinion on a political [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1135.3s)]
*  issue i mean going back even further to the middle ages and think about ireland's legacy as the country [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1142.74s)]
*  that during the the dark ages when europe was being ravaged by barbarian tribes who were burning [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1150.34s)]
*  libraries after the fall of rome it was irish monks who would go into that danger to retrieve [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1156.74s)]
*  books and bring them back to ireland to copy them and preserve them and that's why so many books [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1162.9s)]
*  still exist today because we were so anti-censorship and the idea of destroying [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1169.14s)]
*  literature was so anathema to the irish psyche that our people were willing to go to great lengths [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1174.1000000000001s)]
*  and great personal sacrifice to preserve ideas for the benefit of future generations so i think [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1180.66s)]
*  in a nutshell that is the character of who irish people are and i think that it's a very foreign [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1186.66s)]
*  imported idea that we should be shutting people up and silencing them and trying to stifle ideas [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beDRq1bVM5o&t=1192.98s)]
