# Trump Rejects Biden-Endorsed TikTok Ban
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY)
*  One of the observations we have most frequently made about the Trump era is the way in which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=0.0s)]
*  the Trump candidacy, the Trump presidency, the Trump effort now to return to the Oval [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=11.92s)]
*  Office has scrambled almost completely and in every sense what had been long-standing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=16.76s)]
*  and quite predictable ideological categories. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=21.92s)]
*  One of the examples that illustrates the way in which this is being scrambled is the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=25.52s)]
*  two-year attempt by the Biden White House, it has emanated from the executive branch, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=30.72s)]
*  from the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon, and then into the Biden White House, an attempt to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  urge that the social media platform TikTok be banned in the United States despite the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=40.4s)]
*  fact or really because of the fact that it is so wildly popular among young American [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  citizens. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=51.72s)]
*  Millions of millions of American citizens create their social bonds, find expression [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=52.72s)]
*  politically and socially, obtain their news and their information, form their political [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=56.96s)]
*  ideas on that app. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=61.72s)]
*  It's the place that they go to find community, they spend hours and hours and hours on it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Every day it's almost certainly among young people at least, the most influential social [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=67.64s)]
*  media platform in the country and there is an attempt obviously when there's a social [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=71.12s)]
*  media platform that powerful, that influential, where so many young people are, obviously [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=76.84s)]
*  power centers want to reach them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=82.08s)]
*  They don't want to allow this platform to go uncontrolled and unmonitored and ungoverned. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  That's too dangerous. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  You can't allow young Americans to be consuming information without the U.S. government influencing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  and shaping and dictating what it is that they consume. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's the real reason why there's a move in Washington to ban TikTok and of course [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=99.68s)]
*  they can't admit that so they need a pretext and the pretext is that TikTok has a connection [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  to Chinese people and that then is used as claim that the Chinese Communist Party is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=110.64s)]
*  the platform controlling TikTok and that the Chinese Communist Party uses TikTok to spy [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=116.48s)]
*  on our precious young American youth as well as to propagandize them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=122.64s)]
*  Now, as I said before, we have covered in depth on at least two programs, which we will [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=126.2s)]
*  direct you to if you want to review the arguments, that this is a fear-mongering claim that has [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=131.44s)]
*  emanated from the U.S. security state, gone to the Biden administration and then to the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=136.96s)]
*  establishment wings of both political parties to commandeer a social media platform that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=140.24s)]
*  they cannot yet control and that yet allows a lot of free flow of information because [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  they want to grab that and take it and be able to use it for their own ends. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=149.76s)]
*  Just this week there was a major advancement in the attempt to ban the social media platform [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=155.04s)]
*  that is incredibly popular among American citizens. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=160.4s)]
*  Remember, no one forces any American to use it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=162.8s)]
*  Every American who uses it, uses it voluntarily. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=165.12s)]
*  And when they post their ideas or their views to TikTok, it's because they choose to. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=169.68s)]
*  And nobody tells them what they have to say. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=176.16s)]
*  They express the views that they believe in. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=177.84s)]
*  That's the nature of the app. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=181.28s)]
*  Here from CNN, however, yesterday, House panel unanimously approves a bill that could ban TikTok. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not a Republican initiative. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=190.72s)]
*  It's not a Democratic initiative. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=192.16s)]
*  It is now fully bipartisan. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=193.6s)]
*  The effort to take an app that tens of millions of Americans are using, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=196.16s)]
*  wrestle control away from its current owners, and in the highly likely event that it can't be done [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=200.4s)]
*  within the time period allotted, mandate, require that Apple and Google and other platforms kick [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=205.12s)]
*  them out of the store and do not allow further updates or further downloads. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=211.44s)]
*  Exactly what was done to destroy Parler, the free speech platform in 2021 that became the most [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  popular and most downloaded app in all of the United States, only for Democrats to pressure [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=222.4s)]
*  Apple and Google to remove it from its store, which they did, and then to pressure Amazon [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  web services to stop hosting Parler and destroy Parler overnight. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=233.12s)]
*  That's the same playbook being used here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=236.24s)]
*  Quote, New Jersey Congressman Frank Pallone, its ranking Democrat, this committee's ranking Democrat, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=238.72s)]
*  compared the bill to prior efforts to regulate the US airwaves, citing testimony from national [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=244.08s)]
*  security officials from a closed door hearing Thursday. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=250.0s)]
*  Quote, I take the concerns raised by the intelligence community this morning very seriously. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=254.48s)]
*  Now let me just emphasize where these warnings are coming from. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=259.36s)]
*  These are concerns raised by the intelligence community. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=263.04s)]
*  The intelligence community means the CIA, the FBI, Homeland Security, and then here too, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=266.24s)]
*  the way in which this bill emerged is a result of testimony from national security officials [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=273.04s)]
*  from a closed door hearing on Thursday. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=278.48s)]
*  Now, if I know anything about right-wing politics in the United States in the era of Trump, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=282.32s)]
*  it is that almost everybody on the right, practically by definition, has expressed [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  serious concern about the way in which the national security state is trying to control [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  the content and the flow of information over the internet. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  That's what the Twitter files were about. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  That's what all of the rage and anger was about when it came to censoring dissent on COVID [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=306.64s)]
*  and on the war in Ukraine in the 2020 election. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=312.24s)]
*  That was what the court rulings were about that we reported on first at a district court level [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  and then an appellate court level that found that the attempts by the Biden [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  executive branch and various agencies within it, including the CIA and the FBI and the CDC, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=324.24s)]
*  have been coercing and threatening big tech to remove content that they dislike that they [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=330.08s)]
*  regard as false or dangerous. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=333.84s)]
*  A program that the four judges in the federal system that have reviewed it have said is as [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=336.64s)]
*  profound an attack on the First Amendment guarantee of free speech as any in decades. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=342.24s)]
*  How is it that anyone who has been thinking that, anyone who has been saying that over the past [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=348.08s)]
*  five years or seven years, can now turn around and applaud when the CIA and the FBI in closed [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=353.12s)]
*  door meetings convinces Congress to seize control of one of the most popular social media apps and, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=359.68s)]
*  if they can't, to ban it from existing in the United States, to ban American citizens who want [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=365.52s)]
*  to use it from being able to use it? It's such an inherently extreme and extremist measure [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=371.2s)]
*  and they're counting on the fact that a lot of people fear China the way liberals fear Russia [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=378.88s)]
*  and all they have to do is invoke the scary specter of China for everyone to stand up and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=383.52s)]
*  applaud the government and Joe Biden and the bipartisan Congress for seizing control of this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=388.0s)]
*  app. This is what's really happening here. Now just to continue and conclude the CNN article, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=393.12s)]
*  quote, they have asked Congress, meaning the intelligence community has asked Congress, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=399.92s)]
*  to give them more authority to act in these narrowly defined situations and I believe this bill [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=403.52s)]
*  will do that. Now the last time there was a bill that was presented, whenever, when the last time [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=409.2s)]
*  there was this kind of hysteria created over TikTok when the CEO of TikTok testified back in [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=416.24s)]
*  early 2023, the bill that was presented that they told people was designed to allow Joe Biden and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=422.08s)]
*  the government to ban TikTok if they wanted, in fact vested far more powers in the government [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=429.6s)]
*  than just that. It allowed them to basically ban any social media app that has foreign ownership [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=435.2s)]
*  that they degree to be dangerous. Now here is, I just want to in light of that highlight what [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=439.44s)]
*  he's saying here. He's saying they, namely the intelligence community, they have asked Congress [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=447.52s)]
*  to give them more authority to act in these narrowly defined situations, meaning when they perceive [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=457.68s)]
*  that a social media app is being threatening to their interest by allowing certain speech to flow [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=464.0s)]
*  the CIA and the FBI and Homeland Security are demanding from Congress in closed-door hearings [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=470.0s)]
*  the power to stop that and control that. How can anybody be satisfied with that? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=474.56s)]
*  Especially those of you who have been raising grievances about the attempt by the US security [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=480.0s)]
*  state to control the flow of information over the internet. What is this if not that? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=485.04s)]
*  Now the way the bill is structured is designed to again create this perception that it's really [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=492.08s)]
*  about curbing Chinese control. It essentially requires that the parent company of TikTok, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=498.08s)]
*  ByteDance, which is a China-based company, spin off TikTok within a very short amount of time, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=506.08s)]
*  basically six months, and that if they don't they will then be banned from the United States. Now [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=514.48s)]
*  spitting off a company the size of TikTok is a massive undertaking and this amount of time is [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=519.6s)]
*  almost certainly constructed in order to fail and that is exactly what TikTok's response is to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=527.12s)]
*  this bill. Here's what TikTok says, quote, our statement on today's committee vote, quote, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=533.52s)]
*  this legislation has a predetermined outcome, a total ban of TikTok in the United States. The [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=538.88s)]
*  government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their constitutional right to free [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=544.48s)]
*  expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=550.8s)]
*  the livelihoods of countless creators across the country. Now back in 2020 Donald Trump also [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=555.44s)]
*  got behind a threat to ban TikTok, but in response to that threat he was able to extract concessions [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=563.2s)]
*  including ensuring that TikTok has a primarily American management, which they now do. TikTok [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=571.2800000000001s)]
*  agreed to place control over the data it receives from American users inside the United States under [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=578.08s)]
*  the control of an American company and it has increasingly turned over responsibility for so [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=586.48s)]
*  called content moderation decisions to the United States security state. So a lot of these concerns [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=593.76s)]
*  were assuaged by putting under American control both control over the data and control over content [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=600.88s)]
*  moderation decisions and in fact what TikTok has been doing is hiring a slew of former content [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=610.32s)]
*  moderators from Facebook and Google who as we've reported many times before have extensive ties to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=618.32s)]
*  the U.S. security state precisely because they want to prove to the United States that they are [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=624.56s)]
*  willing to play ball when it comes to censorship. The problem is that the control over TikTok is not [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=630.88s)]
*  as great in the part not by the United States government as it is control over Facebook and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=636.16s)]
*  Google. They want Facebook and Google to remain these powerful bohemian in which all power is [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=641.1199999999999s)]
*  centralized because that's what they can control more. Now here is Joe Biden. He is going on some [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=646.0s)]
*  sort of victory lap after his State of the Union address where he didn't fall down where his teeth [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=653.44s)]
*  didn't fall out where he didn't start having saliva come out of his mouth and he is getting ready to [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=657.44s)]
*  leave for Philadelphia to go to a campaign event and he was asked about this issue with TikTok and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=667.6s)]
*  here's what he said. I just saw a little bit on television. I thought she's a very talented woman. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=672.1600000000001s)]
*  I didn't quite understand the connection she was making. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=680.8s)]
*  So the question was do you still support banning TikTok? Will you sign this bill? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=689.04s)]
*  And here was Biden's answer. If they pass it I'll sign it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=693.92s)]
*  All right so there you have it and it's not a surprise Joe Biden has been supporting a ban [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=700.4799999999999s)]
*  of TikTok for a long time now. Earlier today on his true social media platform Donald Trump also [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=704.56s)]
*  addressed this bill and he had a much different response than Joe Biden. Donald Trump said the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=712.4s)]
*  following if you get rid of TikTok, Facebook, and Zuckerschmuck it will double their business. I don't [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  want Facebook who cheated in the last election doing better. They are a true enemy of the people [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=725.3599999999999s)]
*  and then Rand Paul put that into his own language and he said the following. This is Senator Rand [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=730.0s)]
*  Paul the Republican from Kentucky quote, if Congress bans TikTok they will be acting just like [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=736.64s)]
*  the Chinese Communists who have also banned TikTok. Why not just defend the First Amendment? So [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=741.76s)]
*  ordinarily right-wing media loves to convince its audience that Joe Biden is weak on national [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=748.48s)]
*  security, he's weak on Russia, he's weak on Israel, he's weak on China and yet here you have Joe Biden [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=755.9200000000001s)]
*  with a very aggressive foreign policy of fueling a war against Russia, of paying for and supporting [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=764.08s)]
*  Israel's war in Gaza, of bombing Yemen continuously without congressional approval, bombing sites that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=768.1600000000001s)]
*  he claims are backed by Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria. He has militarily encircled China by [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=775.12s)]
*  putting bases, military bases all around them in almost every direction and now here is Joe Biden [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=782.0s)]
*  saying that he supports a ban of TikTok on the grounds that it's controlled by the Chinese [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=789.36s)]
*  while Donald Trump's saying the only thing this will do is drive more and more people into Facebook [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=792.88s)]
*  and if you're a conservative why would you want to do that given how much you know [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=798.32s)]
*  about the government's ability to control the flow of information on Facebook and their ability to [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7e4ySzFpwY&t=801.6s)]
