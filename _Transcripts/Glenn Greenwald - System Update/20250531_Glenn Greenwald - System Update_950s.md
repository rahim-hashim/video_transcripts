# Historian Warns Rubio Must "Get a Grip" on Russia/Ukraine Talks
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4)
*  Johnathan Haslam, thanks so much for joining us on System Update. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=11.16s)]
*  As we're recording this, there is talk of a new round of Russia-Ukraine negotiations [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=13.3s)]
*  in Istanbul. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Russia has promised to deliver a memorandum stipulating its main request for the process [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=21.04s)]
*  towards a long-term peace deal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=28.06s)]
*  Ukraine has reportedly submitted its own memorandum that is premised on fundamentally first having [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=30.54s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=36.42s)]
*  That's Ukraine's main immediate demand. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=37.42s)]
*  What is your assessment so far of this renewed round of peace talks in Istanbul between Ukraine [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=39.56s)]
*  and Russia? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=45.7s)]
*  Well, I don't like to sound pessimistic, but on previous occasions, this has always [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=46.7s)]
*  fallen apart. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=56.46s)]
*  And the problem is that any meeting between Putin and Trump is predicated on the Ukrainian [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=58.42s)]
*  delegation meeting the Russian delegation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=68.42s)]
*  And the trouble is that when they get together, that's where things fall apart. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=71.86s)]
*  In other words, you do need mediation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=77.9s)]
*  They've been at war for too long. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=80.98s)]
*  The stakes are too high. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=83.38s)]
*  There are people lying on either side to back them up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=86.66s)]
*  The whole thing needs massive decompression. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=92.42s)]
*  And really, this is the responsibility of the United States and the responsibility of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  the Secretary of State Marco Rubio to get a grip on this, which is not at all visible [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=104.58s)]
*  because Mr. Witkoff seems to be the troubleshooter of choice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=112.42s)]
*  He does make some sense in the context of the Middle East, but I don't think he makes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  a great deal of sense in the Moscow context. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  And the Russians are all about status. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=129.94s)]
*  So I'm afraid Mr. Witkoff has never really cut it for them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=133.34s)]
*  On the other hand, they haven't put themselves forward. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=140.7s)]
*  They've not put themselves out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  So for these reasons, I'm not optimistic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=148.78s)]
*  Well the Trump administration might say, look, we are putting ourselves out there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=153.61999999999998s)]
*  In fact, Keith Kellogg, the Trump special envoy on Ukraine, who has been sidelined by [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=156.7s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, but is still engaging in these talks and is promising to show up for the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=163.78s)]
*  new round of negotiations in Istanbul. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=167.82s)]
*  He just put out a statement seemingly addressing Russian concerns about NATO. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=170.94s)]
*  This is what Keith Kellogg said. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=175.14s)]
*  So just some of the notes that I took, there is this report that Putin has outlined these [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=178.1s)]
*  conditions for ending the war, including demanding Western leaders pledge in writing that NATO [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=183.26s)]
*  won't expand eastward. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=189.14s)]
*  Is President Trump willing to make that kind of commitment to Putin that NATO won't expand? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=191.1s)]
*  I think it's a fair concern. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  And we've said that repeatedly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=198.22s)]
*  Like we've said that to us, Ukraine coming into NATO is not on the table. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=199.78s)]
*  And we're not the only country that says that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=205.62s)]
*  I can probably give you four of the countries in NATO, and it takes 32 of the 32 to allow [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=207.86s)]
*  you to come into NATO. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=211.94s)]
*  And we've seen other countries say, we're not too sure about that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  And that's one of the issues that Russia will bring up. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=216.62s)]
*  And they're not just talking Ukraine. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=219.78s)]
*  They're talking the country of Georgia. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=221.82s)]
*  They're talking Moldova. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=223.18s)]
*  They're talking, obviously, Ukraine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=224.98s)]
*  We're saying, OK, comprehensively, we can stop the expansion of NATO coming close to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=226.42s)]
*  your border. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=231.78s)]
*  That's security concerns for them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=232.78s)]
*  So that's Keith Kellogg going a lot further than anybody in the Biden administration did. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=235.1s)]
*  He's saying that Russian concerns about NATO expansion are fair. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=238.98s)]
*  And he suggests there that the US is willing to take NATO expansion off the table, not [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=242.7s)]
*  only for Ukraine, but other countries as well, including Georgia, which was promised NATO [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=246.3s)]
*  membership alongside Ukraine back fatefully in 2008. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=252.46s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=255.46s)]
*  Keith Kellogg saying that Russian concerns are fair and we're willing to take NATO expansion [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=256.66s)]
*  off the table when it comes to Ukraine and Georgia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I this is important. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  The the whole business began because the United States was determined to expand NATO and then [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=268.66s)]
*  put Ukraine in it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=275.3s)]
*  So this is crucial. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=276.7s)]
*  But for how long? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=278.98s)]
*  I mean, they've made statements in the past, oh, for so many years or for the foreseeable [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=280.54s)]
*  future or, you know, that won't cut it with the Russians. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=287.58s)]
*  I mean, I just get the impression that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=291.98s)]
*  However benign. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=295.54s)]
*  These two intermediaries have been on behalf of the United States, they're not the real [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=299.22s)]
*  deal. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=307.54s)]
*  I mean, the Russians, they want the real deal and they this whole business started. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=308.42s)]
*  Well, it started two ways. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=315.74s)]
*  It started one way with the Americans insisting on allowing Ukraine into NATO sometime in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=317.18s)]
*  the future, which is like an indefinite threat hanging over the Russians. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=323.74s)]
*  The the the other element, of course, is, you know, Putin decided to go to war over [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=330.38s)]
*  this, which was crazy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=336.34s)]
*  And it's a war he cannot win. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=338.5s)]
*  But it's also war Ukraine cannot win. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  And it's certainly a war that NATO, Europe cannot win. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  But it strikes me that the key discussions have to be between the Russians and the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=348.58s)]
*  Americans, with the Americans talking to Ukrainians and then talking the Ukrainians to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=356.82s)]
*  bring them in at the right point. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=364.62s)]
*  So in other words, the commitments, the security commitments, the Russians need and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=366.86s)]
*  demand can only be obtained by the from the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=373.82s)]
*  And I just think that President Trump is deluding himself if he thinks they can take a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=379.54s)]
*  slow course and allow the Ukrainians and the Russians to wreak so much destruction [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=387.74s)]
*  on one another. In the end, they'll be exhausted and come through. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=395.7s)]
*  The danger is they have to be preemptive. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=398.82s)]
*  And I cannot understand why Marco Rubio obsesses about China at the moment and obsesses [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=402.42s)]
*  about passports of Chinese students at Harvard when we've got this going on. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=410.02s)]
*  He's he's he's he's running the National Security Council and the State Department. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=418.14s)]
*  Does he not have a view on this? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=424.38s)]
*  If he doesn't, then what exactly is the White House up to? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=427.9s)]
*  When you say that Putin can't win the war in Ukraine, I imagine that there are some [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=433.02s)]
*  supporters of Russia who would take issue with that, who would say, actually, Putin's [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=436.82000000000005s)]
*  been restrained in Ukraine. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=440.58000000000004s)]
*  He hasn't sent nearly the force into Ukraine that he could. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=441.94s)]
*  And of course, Russia does have nuclear weapons. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=445.06s)]
*  So why, in your view, is it impossible for Russia to win in Ukraine? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=447.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, I mean, you can win to the point of self-destruction, but you must remember that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=452.34000000000003s)]
*  all we don't know. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  We don't we hear all the noise. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  We hear the noise from Ukraine. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  We hear the noise in NATO, Europe. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=464.78s)]
*  We hear the noise in D.C. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=467.21999999999997s)]
*  endlessly. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=469.29999999999995s)]
*  What noise do you hear inside Russia? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=471.14s)]
*  Nothing, because they cut us all out. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=473.17999999999995s)]
*  You none none in the West have any idea how bad things are in Russia. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=476.29999999999995s)]
*  And this is a bleeding wound. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=481.53999999999996s)]
*  The Russian economy is in a terrible state. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=485.94s)]
*  They're basically turning it into a war economy. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=488.61999999999995s)]
*  You can't feed people on a war economy. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=491.61999999999995s)]
*  It's a it's a disaster for the coming generations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=494.78s)]
*  The Russians are short of labor. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=498.82s)]
*  That's why inflation is so high. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=500.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, putting young men into the meat grinder is not a solution. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=503.21999999999997s)]
*  The oil price is falling and will continue to fall for the foreseeable future, because [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=508.34s)]
*  I think U.S. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=514.14s)]
*  is already heading into recession. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=515.66s)]
*  If there's a crash on the U.S. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=518.14s)]
*  stock market and there's a crisis in the world economy, the demand for oil will go [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=519.9s)]
*  down even further. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=526.1s)]
*  I mean, the Russians live off oil and gas. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=527.46s)]
*  So they if you were writing a prospectus for Mr. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=530.9s)]
*  Putin, however loyal you were, you'd have to say we cannot continue in this way indefinitely. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=536.42s)]
*  We need to know at least when there will be an end to the conflict. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=542.58s)]
*  And you are not winning it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=547.9s)]
*  You thought you'd win it in two or three days, for God's sake. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=549.5799999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, it's both sides are locked in and the United States is the only [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=553.74s)]
*  country with the power and with the prestige to break the logjam. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=562.18s)]
*  And it's no good getting sending others sending people of I won't say second rate, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=569.06s)]
*  but they're not the top people. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=577.3399999999999s)]
*  When I see Rubio visit Moscow, then I'll know they're serious. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=579.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think that's how the Russians really view it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=585.4599999999999s)]
*  Your characterization of Russia certainly contrasts with what Russia puts out. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=589.02s)]
*  Russia says it has a strong economy and supporters of Putin points to the fact that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=592.6999999999999s)]
*  he does seem to enjoy, if we can believe the polls, strong domestic support. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=597.5s)]
*  I mean, do you think he's in at all a more perilous position than the Kremlin is [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=602.06s)]
*  willing to acknowledge? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=608.2199999999999s)]
*  We don't know his political position, but I mean, if US interest rates were put up [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=610.2199999999999s)]
*  by the Fed to 21%, what sort of state would the US economy be in? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=615.14s)]
*  Why, you know, what sort of condition would that be? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=621.3s)]
*  Just as a starting point. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=624.14s)]
*  So I think Putin is firmly in the saddle because he's made sure over a period since [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=627.02s)]
*  he took power in 2000, certainly since 2004, the people are too frightened to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=636.6999999999999s)]
*  move against him. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=644.38s)]
*  So I don't think any hope of that happening is going to alter the situation. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=647.42s)]
*  It's the economic situation is the fact that Russia in the end, it has to resume [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=652.54s)]
*  a normal rate of growth to keep its population on its feet, basically. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=659.38s)]
*  And so the economy is the key thing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=664.98s)]
*  If Trump wants to impose harder sanctions on Russia, he can do so. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=668.7s)]
*  But the point is that the West looks like it's in disarray. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=675.98s)]
*  You have, I would call them lunatics in NATO Europe talking about World War III [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=680.86s)]
*  and arming Germany in the next five years. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=687.86s)]
*  I mean, Germany doesn't have any nuclear weapons. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=691.94s)]
*  Britain's got a couple. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=696.5s)]
*  France has got a couple. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=698.1s)]
*  The Russians can wipe us all out overnight if we went in that direction. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=699.98s)]
*  So the trouble is there's no coherence from Washington. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=705.74s)]
*  There has to be a coherent NATO position. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=710.1800000000001s)]
*  And within that position, as you pointed out at the very beginning, you cannot say [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=713.22s)]
*  that Ukraine will enter NATO. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=719.6600000000001s)]
*  So in other words, you've got to be firm. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  But on that essential issue, you have to be flexible. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=724.58s)]
*  And it's no use talking about possibilities of war. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=729.0200000000001s)]
*  The Germans using long distance rockets or giving them to Ukrainians. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=733.5s)]
*  I don't know. The key thing with these missiles is not the missiles. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=740.7s)]
*  Who is targeting them? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=744.58s)]
*  Are they going to be targeted by the Pentagon? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=746.1800000000001s)]
*  Are they going to be targeted from NATO Europe, from Rammstein or somewhere? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=749.0600000000001s)]
*  If they are, and those missiles go in and start hitting Moscow or wherever. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=754.58s)]
*  You know, this is this is going to be war. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=762.1s)]
*  And you were referring to the statements from recently from German Chancellor Mertz, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=765.6600000000001s)]
*  who said that there are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=771.6600000000001s)]
*  supplied to Ukraine, including from us, from the Germans, which suggests that [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=775.9s)]
*  Germany has given or is preparing to give Ukraine a long range tourist missiles. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=779.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it might. If it was lunatic enough. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=785.18s)]
*  I mean, Mertz is a complete amateur. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=789.62s)]
*  He lost the elections. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=794.42s)]
*  They won't allow the new party on the right to get near power. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=796.66s)]
*  So they're trying to hold their country together and adopt a warlike pose. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=801.86s)]
*  And Mertz doesn't cut it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=808.34s)]
*  He doesn't impress people. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=810.6999999999999s)]
*  God knows what the standard of statesmanship in Europe is even worse than in the United States [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=814.06s)]
*  and in Russia. So one shouldn't look to Europe to save anybody. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=820.54s)]
*  What we need is firm action, a thoroughly realist position. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=826.46s)]
*  And we need presidential commitment. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=833.1400000000001s)]
*  And every week I turn on or every day I turn on the television and the White House has [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=836.86s)]
*  committed itself to something else. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=844.34s)]
*  Now it's committed itself to the Reagan Star Wars umbrella idea when the U.S. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=846.62s)]
*  is practically bankrupt in terms of debt. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=854.1800000000001s)]
*  There's a sort of stunning lack of realism in the White House at the moment about the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=857.74s)]
*  world, the world economy, how you're dealing with foreign powers. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=865.3000000000001s)]
*  The only realism is in domestic policy, which is ruthlessly realistic. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=870.62s)]
*  Maybe that will help them win the House. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=876.4200000000001s)]
*  OK, so it may make sense in domestic politics. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=879.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, no one's going to win the House in the autumn by saving Ukraine. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=884.0999999999999s)]
*  That's the truth of it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=889.42s)]
*  So in other words, foreign policy can wait as far as they're concerned. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=890.9s)]
*  The trouble is that the situation in Eastern Europe is not stable and we can't guarantee [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=895.78s)]
*  with all this warmongering going on in Europe that it will remain even as stable as the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=904.18s)]
*  graveyard that Ukraine is at the moment. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=912.06s)]
*  We can't guarantee that will continue indefinitely. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=915.02s)]
*  But some people in the White House, I think, believe they can wait it out to the autumn. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxgwdUBJx4&t=918.2199999999999s)]
