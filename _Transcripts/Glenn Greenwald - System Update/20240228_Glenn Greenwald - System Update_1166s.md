# Aaron Bushnell Disparagedâ€”Is Self-Immolation Always Immoral?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU)
*  Last night we started the show by addressing the case of Aaron Bushnell who was an active [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=0.0s)]
*  duty senior airman in the US Air Force who went to the Israeli embassy in Washington [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=12.88s)]
*  on Sunday and set himself on fire in protest of the Israeli war in Gaza and also US support [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  for that war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=28.8s)]
*  There was a lot of requests we had in chat and by email and elsewhere for us to comment [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=29.8s)]
*  on it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=34.28s)]
*  Last night I said we didn't really feel comfortable doing that because there were very few facts [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=35.28s)]
*  about him that had been released. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=39.44s)]
*  There wasn't much known about what he did and why and I felt more comfortable waiting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=42.2s)]
*  until we had more facts rather than just trying to opine or feed an existing narrative and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=46.74s)]
*  I said we'll talk about it tomorrow night. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=51.56s)]
*  There are more facts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=55.32s)]
*  I think his motive is now extremely clear and I don't want to talk entirely or specifically [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=56.32s)]
*  about what Aaron Bushnell did as the focus because people probably have already existing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=65.88s)]
*  views on whether this was a noble thing based on their underlying view of the cause that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=71.64s)]
*  he invoked when he did it, namely the war in Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=77.52s)]
*  If you love Israel, if you think they're doing the right thing in Gaza, you're probably a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=80.66s)]
*  little bit opposed to Aaron Bushnell. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=84.08s)]
*  If you believe that the Israeli war in Gaza is immoral and evil or genocidal as the South [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=86.12s)]
*  Africans have alleged in the International Court of Justice and so have other countries, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=93.14s)]
*  then you'll probably believe that what he did was noble. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=97.32s)]
*  So it kind of depends on the underlying cause but that's the point because there was a lot [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=99.4s)]
*  of people claiming that what Aaron Bushnell did is inherently immoral or it's a sign of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  insanity and mental illness only that it doesn't deserve to be praised for that reason. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=112.54s)]
*  And without opining on the specific case precisely because I still think you kind of need to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=119.06s)]
*  know a little bit more, what I do know for sure is that the act of setting yourself on [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=123.76s)]
*  fire to protest an injustice in the world is a very common form of protest and it's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=128.26000000000002s)]
*  something that United States politicians and officials and journalists have often praised [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=133.1s)]
*  and celebrated when it served a cause that they support, namely protesting the injustice [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=139.1s)]
*  of American enemies, whether it be Russia or China or Iran or all kinds of other cases. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=146.98s)]
*  So this idea that self-immolation is inherently insane, that it's inherently an act that ought [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=154.74s)]
*  to be denounced has never been the way we've looked at this act previously. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=159.04s)]
*  It's always been looked at as an act of enormous courage and sacrifice and you know there's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=165.8s)]
*  probably some of you might remember that right after 9-11 Bill Maher had a talk show, not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=170.84s)]
*  the one he has now on HBO but a different one called Politically Incorrect and a week [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=177.4s)]
*  or two after 9-11 he went on the air and a lot of people at the time were claiming that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  the 9-11 hijackers were quote cowards and Bill Maher went on the air and said look what [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=188.44s)]
*  they did is reprehensible, I condemn it, I think it's repugnant but the one thing you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=194.12s)]
*  can't say about 9-11 hijackers who deliberately drove planes into a building knowing they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=198.32s)]
*  were giving up their own lives for a cause in which they believed, the one thing you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=204.34s)]
*  cannot say about them is that they're cowardly. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=207.3s)]
*  It takes courage to give up your own life for a cause and it takes courage if you're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=211.12s)]
*  going to die suddenly like flying an airplane to a building and it takes even more courage [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  the most excruciating ways imaginable which is dying by setting yourself on fire and there's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=220.68s)]
*  no way to diminish that courage whether you think the cause is unjust or not is of course [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=228.72s)]
*  a separate question. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=234.28s)]
*  Personally I do have admiration for people who get to the point where they believe in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=236.44s)]
*  a cause so much that they're willing to sacrifice their own self-interest whether people like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  Edward Snowden who ended up in exile in Russia and who we thought was going to end up in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=244.16s)]
*  a maximum security prison for the rest of his life or Julian Assange who did the same [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=249.16s)]
*  or people who fight in a war because they believe in the justice of that war and risk [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=252.6s)]
*  their own life to do so, there's no way to deny the moral courage and physical courage [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=257.36s)]
*  of that kind of an act and a lot of this discourse which tries to disparage self-immolation as [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=261.76s)]
*  just something only a mentally ill person would do is very inconsistent with the way [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=268.28s)]
*  we often have talked about self-immolation in the past when it was used for a cause that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=273.12s)]
*  American elites actually support. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=277.68s)]
*  So first of all just the kind of core facts from the New York Times quote, man dies after [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=283.24s)]
*  setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington, Air Force says quote, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=287.18s)]
*  Aaron Bushnell an active duty senior airman repeatedly shouted quote, free Palestine as [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  he filmed and live streamed his protest against Israel's deadly military actions in Gaza. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=297.8s)]
*  He had been taken to a hospital on Sunday with life threatening injuries. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=302.56s)]
*  He went on to die quote, I will no longer be complicit in genocide, a man says in the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=306.08s)]
*  video echoing language that opponents of Israel's military offensive in Gaza have used to describe [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  the war quote, I am about to engage in an extreme act of protest but compared to what [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  people have been experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers, it's not [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=321.8s)]
*  extreme at all. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=326.08s)]
*  Now that sounds to me like somebody who had a rational understanding of what they were [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  doing who set out to explain what they were doing, did so in a coherent way, a truthful [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=332.34s)]
*  way and then went about and did it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=336.73999999999995s)]
*  So it's hard to say oh he was mentally ill, he didn't know what he was doing because everything [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=341.14s)]
*  he left behind suggests that he had a very clear and coherent understanding of what he [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=345.06s)]
*  did and why. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=348.82s)]
*  Here from the Washington Post gave a little more detail about him, the airman who set [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  grew up on a religious compound and had an anarchist past. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=356.82s)]
*  Now as I said, a lot of people are pretending that they hate this protest because self-immolation [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=362.82s)]
*  in and of itself is inherently wrong and bad and yet they've not been consistent at all [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=371.74s)]
*  when similar or identical acts were undertaken for a cause they supported. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=377.98s)]
*  Here for example is one of the most intellectually dishonest, whiny, petulant and toxic people [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=381.86s)]
*  in American political life, the former Congressman Adam Kinsinger, the Republican of Illinois, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  who knew he couldn't be elected to Congress and so went to CNN. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=391.62s)]
*  He's a fanatical supporter of things like the US funding of the war in Ukraine. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=395.06s)]
*  He has a Ukrainian flag everywhere he goes but he also supports the US financing of Israel. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=398.94s)]
*  He's a big Israel supporter as well and so he went on to Twitter and said quote, suicide [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=406.26s)]
*  is not heroic. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=411.0s)]
*  This is when obviously everybody was discussing the Aaron Bushnell case and he was there to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=412.1s)]
*  disparage it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=417.2s)]
*  Suicide is not heroic he said. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=418.48s)]
*  And yet many people found a tweet of his from February of 2022 right after the Russians [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=421.88s)]
*  had invaded in which he said the following, a salute with two Ukrainian flags and two [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=432.94s)]
*  American flags, hero Ukrainian soldier quote blows himself up to destroy bridge and stop [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=439.96s)]
*  Russian invasion forces storming in from Crimea. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=446.48s)]
*  So there he was praising as honorable and heroic an act of suicide in defense of a cause [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=450.92s)]
*  that he actually supported. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=459.48s)]
*  Now you might say well that wasn't self-immolation, it was suicide. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=461.76s)]
*  So let's look at other examples of how self-immolation has typically been discussed. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=466.04s)]
*  One of the people who I immediately remembered as having engaged in self-immolation was a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=472.16s)]
*  25 year old street vendor in Tunisia. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=478.0s)]
*  He had been college educated but he couldn't get a job in Tunisia. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=481.04s)]
*  It was a corrupt society, repressive society. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=484.24s)]
*  He was forced to work as a vendor selling items on the street to support his family [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=487.14000000000004s)]
*  and the police came one day and tried to take all of his things that he was selling which [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  is the only way he could earn a living in Tunisia. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=497.64s)]
*  There had just been a WikiLeaks report the year before showing how all these countries [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=499.96s)]
*  in that region that the United States supported were deeply corrupt. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=503.8s)]
*  The New York Times editor-in-chief at the time Bill Keller credited WikiLeaks with helping [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=507.8s)]
*  to spark the Arab Spring and Arab Spring activists won the Sakura Prize which is named after [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=512.2s)]
*  a Russian dissident. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=520.52s)]
*  It's genuinely given for people who the West considers heroic. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=521.52s)]
*  And here's who won in 2011. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=525.84s)]
*  You see the headline Arab Spring activists win 2011 Sakura Prizes from Radio Free Liberty. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=527.8s)]
*  Quote, five Arab Spring activists have won the European Parliament's 2011 Sakura Prize. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=533.56s)]
*  Quote, this year's winner symbolizes the struggle for dignity, for democracy and for human rights [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=540.04s)]
*  and they are co-authors of historical change in the Arab world. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=545.72s)]
*  Buzik said, not sure who Buzik is, I presume it's somebody with the European Union. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  The winners are Mohamed Bouazizi from Tunisia whose death after he set himself on fire triggered [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  the chain of popular uprising in North Africa that became known as the Arab Spring. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=563.48s)]
*  And this person, this 25-year-old street vendor who set himself on fire in Tunisia was widely [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=569.84s)]
*  heralded as someone engaged in an act of great heroism, of great nobility, of great consequence. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=576.26s)]
*  He won the Sakura Prize after he had died for his act of self-immolation. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=582.66s)]
*  And here's what President Obama had to say about this in January of 2011. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=587.3s)]
*  On December 17th, a young vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi was devastated when a police officer [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=594.02s)]
*  confiscated his cart. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=601.2199999999999s)]
*  This was not unique. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=604.82s)]
*  It's the same kind of humiliation that takes place every day in many parts of the world, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=605.82s)]
*  the relentless tyranny of governments that deny their citizens dignity. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=612.0200000000001s)]
*  Only this time something different happened. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=617.6s)]
*  After local officials refused to hear his complaints, this young man, who had never [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=620.82s)]
*  been particularly active in politics, went to the headquarters of the provincial government, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=624.44s)]
*  doused himself in fuel and lit himself on fire. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=629.98s)]
*  There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary citizens spark [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=634.26s)]
*  movements for change because they speak to a longing for freedom that has been building [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=642.66s)]
*  up for years. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=647.14s)]
*  In America, think of the defiance of those patriots in Boston who refused to pay taxes [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=650.18s)]
*  to a king, or the dignity of Rosa Parks as she sat courageously in her seat. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=654.64s)]
*  So it was in Tunisia, as that vendor's act of desperation tapped into the frustration [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=663.18s)]
*  felt throughout the country. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=668.5s)]
*  That is veneration for somebody who engaged in active self-immolation against a government [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=671.0999999999999s)]
*  that we were denouncing as tyrannical. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=676.9799999999999s)]
*  Now, the reality was these governments that became the target of the Arab Spring, including [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=679.3s)]
*  Egypt, were dictatorships the United States, including the Obama administration, had long [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=683.9s)]
*  supported. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=689.14s)]
*  But Obama loved nothing more than getting up on his high horse and talking about people's [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=691.36s)]
*  quest for freedom and comparing everybody to Rosa Parks. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=694.96s)]
*  And so this Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire became a hero of the Washington [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=699.84s)]
*  press and of President Obama. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=704.96s)]
*  That was the prevailing narrative, not that he was mentally ill, that only a crazy person [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=708.1s)]
*  would set himself on fire, that setting yourself on fire is a very stupid way to engage in [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=711.74s)]
*  protests. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=716.52s)]
*  Keeping prizes on him and veneration at the highest level of Washington politics from [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=717.52s)]
*  the podium at the White House by the president. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=723.78s)]
*  Because in that case, that was a political cause that we wanted to ride on, that we wanted [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=728.18s)]
*  to celebrate, that we wanted to expand. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=731.74s)]
*  And so self-immolation was something that we regarded as courageous. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=737.02s)]
*  The same exact thing happened when a dissident journalist in Russia set herself on fire here [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=739.46s)]
*  from Politico in October of 2020. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=746.8s)]
*  For Russia, a journalist's self-immolation is a wake-up call. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=750.42s)]
*  Irina Slavina's last message was for, quote, for my death, I ask you to blame the Russian [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=755.28s)]
*  Federation. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=760.4399999999999s)]
*  She was constantly held up as an anti-Putin hero because she used self-immolation not [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=763.3399999999999s)]
*  our ally, as this 25-year-old airman did, but to denounce one of our enemies, the Russian [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=770.74s)]
*  government. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=777.0600000000001s)]
*  Nobody, very few people in American political life criticized her self-immolation because [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=778.62s)]
*  it was aimed at Vladimir Putin. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=784.74s)]
*  Here from the New York Times, March 4, 2016, a Tibetan monk, 18 years old, dies after self-immolation [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=787.44s)]
*  to protest Chinese rule. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=795.1800000000001s)]
*  The monk, Khalsang Wangdu, 18, set himself to fire on Monday, according to Free Tibet, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=798.32s)]
*  a group based in London. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=804.4200000000001s)]
*  On the same day, a 16-year-old Tibetan student, George E. Searing, committed the same act [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=805.4200000000001s)]
*  in India while shouting, Free Tibet, the group said. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=811.34s)]
*  He survived and was in a hospital in New Delhi. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=813.8000000000001s)]
*  On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton, the front-runner to be the Democratic presidential candidate, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=815.94s)]
*  helped up a black-and-white photo of Mr. Dorje while talking in Minnesota to the president [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=820.62s)]
*  of the Tibetan National Congress, an advocacy group. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=827.0s)]
*  And there you see the photo of Hillary Clinton celebrating this 16-year-old boy who set himself [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=831.88s)]
*  on fire on behalf of Tibet in protest of an American enemy, namely China. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=839.0s)]
*  So if you self-immolate and you do so to protest China or you do so to protest Russia or you [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  do so in protest of tyranny in the Arab world and Americans want to pretend that they're [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=854.02s)]
*  on the side of freedom for the Arab world, self-immolation gets celebrated as heroic. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=858.4200000000001s)]
*  There are monuments built and prizes given for it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=863.82s)]
*  Here from Radio Free Liberty in January of 2019, 50 years after his self-immolation, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=868.6600000000001s)]
*  Czech student Jan Palak remains a symbol of defiance. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=874.26s)]
*  He was a Czech student who engaged in self-immolation to protest the Soviet Union's repression of [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=879.4s)]
*  his country. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=886.76s)]
*  And here you have Radio Free Liberty talking about him as a symbol, a heroic symbol of [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=888.56s)]
*  defiance. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=892.6s)]
*  Not as mentally ill, not as a crazy person, not as selfish, not as somebody who should [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  be disparaged, somebody who should be held up and admired. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=899.52s)]
*  The front of the show and the very intrepid independent journalist Michael Tracy found [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=905.56s)]
*  this example, quote, Robert McNamara in his 1995 memoir on Norman Morrison, a Quaker anti-war [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=910.9799999999999s)]
*  activist who self-immolated 40 feet from McNamara's Pentagon window on November 2nd, 1965. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=919.02s)]
*  McNamara said he was deeply affected by the act, especially because his wife and kids [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=925.66s)]
*  agreed with the immolator. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=930.9s)]
*  I can show you a lot more here from, this is I believe from McNamara's book where he [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=933.82s)]
*  wrote, anti-war protest had been sporadic and limited up to this time and had not compelled [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=942.6s)]
*  attention. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=947.0400000000001s)]
*  Then came the afternoon of November 2nd, 1965 at twilight that day, a young Quaker named [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=948.58s)]
*  Norman Morrison, father of three and an officer of the Stoney Run Friends meeting in Baltimore, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=953.4000000000001s)]
*  burned himself to death within 40 feet of my Pentagon window. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=958.88s)]
*  He doused himself with fuel from a gallon jug and when he set himself on fire, he was [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=962.98s)]
*  holding his one-year-old daughter in his arms and he screamed, quote, save the child and [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=969.66s)]
*  he flung her out of his arms. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=973.36s)]
*  She survived without injury. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=974.8s)]
*  After Morrison's death, his wife issued a statement that basically explained why he [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=977.06s)]
*  did what he did to stop the war in Vietnam and McNamara said the following in his book, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=982.8s)]
*  quote, I reacted to the horror of his action by bottling up my emotions and avoided talking [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=987.9s)]
*  about them with anyone, even my family. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=992.0s)]
*  I knew Marge and our three children shared many of Morrison's feelings about the war [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=994.62s)]
*  as did the wives and children of my cabinet colleagues and I believed I understood and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=998.34s)]
*  shared some of his thoughts. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1003.26s)]
*  So again, we have a long history of heaping praise on people who use this as a form of [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1007.1s)]
*  protest, obviously an extreme form of protest, but we have often said that extreme injustice [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1012.4399999999999s)]
*  justifies and merits this kind of protest and now suddenly in the discourse, there's [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1018.86s)]
*  this effort to depict self-immolation as something only insane people do, something that ought [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1024.1s)]
*  to be disparaged and maligned. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1029.7s)]
*  There were calls on Twitter today for people demanding that Elon Musk remove the tweet [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1035.78s)]
*  of Cornell West who spoke in admiration, not of the act of self-immolation even, but just [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1041.16s)]
*  for Aaron Bushnell who is the one who engaged in self-immolation and the cause of stopping [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1047.38s)]
*  the war in Gaza and a lot of people including some who I respect because they've been long [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  involved in the campaign in favor of free speech and against online censorship actually [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1058.3400000000001s)]
*  started saying Cornell West's tweet should be removed because somehow it glorifies suicide [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1063.14s)]
*  and encourages people to take their own life saying it violated the rules of acts and called [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1068.44s)]
*  on Elon Musk to remove it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1072.76s)]
*  And obviously the reason is not because they're offended by self-immolation, self-immolation [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  is celebrated if it's done for the right cause, it's because they were concerned that this [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1079.72s)]
*  might bring consciousness to the cause of stopping the war in Gaza and these people [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1085.3s)]
*  are very vehement supporters of Israel in the war in Gaza and therefore want to disparage [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1089.52s)]
*  this act, but that is not always how, in fact that's not usually how self-immolation is [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1095.3799999999999s)]
*  discussed, it's often discussed as a very noble and brave and heroic and consequential [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1099.22s)]
*  act of protest that has sparked some of the most important and beneficial events according [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1105.4599999999998s)]
*  to our political and media elites when it serves their agenda to do so and so I think [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1110.3s)]
*  as you hear this discourse about Aaron Bushnell and what he did, I think it's very important [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1115.78s)]
*  to understand that the context is not that self-immolation is considered intrinsically [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1120.78s)]
*  wrong, it's all based on how people view the cause that is being advanced by that very [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1125.92s)]
*  extreme, admittedly extreme but also definitely very courageous act. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_kQ-l--iU&t=1134.56s)]
