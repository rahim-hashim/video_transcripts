# Evidence of Israeli Atrocities in Gaza Continue to Emerge
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ)
*  Now all that is happening as a couple of pieces of evidence of serious abuse by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the Israelis in Gaza continue to emerge here from the New York Times this week. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=13.6s)]
*  The article is stripped, beaten, or vanished. Israel's treatment of Gaza [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=17.16s)]
*  detainees raises alarm. Quote, a UN office said Israel's detention and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  treatment of detainees might amount to torture. It estimated thousands have been [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=27.72s)]
*  detained and held in quote, horrific conditions. Some detainees were freed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  wearing only diapers. Palestinian detainees from Gaza have been stripped, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=36.48s)]
*  beaten, interrogated, and held incommunicado over the past three months [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=41.04s)]
*  according to accounts by nearly a dozen of the detainees or their relatives [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=45.28s)]
*  interviewed by the New York Times. Organizations representing Palestinian [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=49.92s)]
*  prisoners and detainees gave similar accounts on a report accusing Israel of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=53.6s)]
*  both indiscriminate detention of civilians and demeaning treatment of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=58.36s)]
*  detainees. Israeli forces who invaded Gaza after the October 7th Amazigh [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=62.28s)]
*  attack have detained men, women, and children by the thousands. A spokesman [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=67.16s)]
*  for the International Committee of the Red Cross, Hishma Mahana, said his [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=72.6s)]
*  organization received daily reports from families in Gaza about detained family [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=76.44s)]
*  members. The organization is working on some 4,000 cases of Palestinians from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=81.24s)]
*  Gaza who had been vanished, nearly half believed to be detained by the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=85.36s)]
*  Israeli military. Photos and videos taken by Israeli soldiers and Israeli [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  journalists embedded with the military have shown Palestinians with hands bound [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=94.08s)]
*  behind their backs, sometimes blindfolded, and in underwear kneeling [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  outdoor in winter. In one video taken at a stadium in Gaza City, dozens of males [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  wearing only underwear are lined up or marched across the field surrounded by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  Israeli soldiers. Some of the men were gray-haired and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=111.72s)]
*  several were young boys. Now this is part of what happened after 9-11, the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=116.08s)]
*  United States abused detainees in mass numbers and these laws of wars were [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=122.36s)]
*  implemented in the wake of the Second World War to avoid exactly these kinds [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=128.56s)]
*  of abuses. You can take prisoners of war and war, but you owe them a standard of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=133.6s)]
*  care and dignity that is clearly woefully falling short when it comes to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  the Israeli detention of Palestinians. And by the way, the Israelis have been [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=144.2s)]
*  imprisoning Palestinians in the West Bank, a place that the entire world [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  regards as them illegally occupying, for years with no charges of any kind, simply [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  on military detention. And when these people get out through prisoner [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=158.44s)]
*  exchanges and the like, they are so physically and psychologically destroyed that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=163.16s)]
*  there is no question that they were subjected to torture. You just watch them, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  they don't know their names, they don't know where they are, they stare into [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=173.84s)]
*  space, they can't orient themselves, they walk as though they're a hundred years [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=176.88s)]
*  old. This is the truth. The truth of how the Israelis treat the Palestinians in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=183.48s)]
*  land that the entire world recognizes as the Israelis illegally occupying it and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=191.48s)]
*  now the Israeli treatment of detainees in Gaza falls radically short of what [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  the laws of war require in terms of the treatment of detainees. This is one of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=204.04s)]
*  the things that motivated me to get into politics and write about journalism in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=209.68s)]
*  the first place was the abuse of detainees on a mass scale by the United [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=212.84s)]
*  States in the wake of 9-11. You cannot claim that you are a civilized country [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=217.08s)]
*  fighting for civilized values if you do not adhere to minimal standards of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  civilized decency, especially when it comes to helpless detainees already [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  disarmed in your custody. Here is a video of a kind of incident that has been [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=234.44s)]
*  happening every day in Gaza. It just so happened that a British television crew [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=242.6s)]
*  interviewed the victim and then right when the interview was done the Israeli [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=249.72s)]
*  military shot and tried to kill as many of the people they had just interviewed [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=257.56s)]
*  as possible and they were having their arms in the air waving a white flag. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=261.32s)]
*  There were only four of them or five of them explaining why they wanted to go to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=267.08s)]
*  the end of the block to get their two relatives who had not been allowed out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=271.24s)]
*  The British television crew went over and interviewed them and they explained [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=275.56s)]
*  that and the minute the interview was done the Israelis opened fire on these [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=280.12s)]
*  five unarmed people standing there with a white flag and their hands in the air [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  and killed one of them while women and children just a few feet away were [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  terrorized. Take a look just watch what happened. These pictures were filmed by [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=294.48s)]
*  a cameraman working for ITV news in Gaza. As he moved forwards towards the combat [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  zone he noticed this group of men doing their utmost to appear non-threatening [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=308.32s)]
*  trying to proceed with care. They wanted to reach two other family members and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=314.32s)]
*  get them out of harm's way. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=320.6s)]
*  I have my mother and brother in there with around 50 or 70 displaced people in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=324.0s)]
*  another house. The Israelis claimed to us and told us to evacuate but they didn't [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=331.4s)]
*  let my brother out. We want to go and try to get them out God willing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=336.2s)]
*  The interview complete our cameraman walked away and then this happened. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=343.88s)]
*  The interviewee had been shot and fatally wounded. You can see them place [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=355.0s)]
*  their flag on his chest. As he was carried away the white flag was turning red. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=361.2s)]
*  Carry him they've killed him yells this youth then suddenly more gunfire. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  Look at that little boy there right here. I think I can't do the graphics for a [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=389.56s)]
*  video so just watch this scene here. There's a little boy he is probably [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=398.96s)]
*  about I would say 10 to 12 years old witnessing all of this in the middle of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=412.2s)]
*  having the Israelis shoot at him seeing this person who was just shot you watch [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  them with their arms in the air doing absolutely nothing threatening unarmed [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=424.52s)]
*  having just spoken to a British television crew about what they were [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=427.88s)]
*  trying to do and get their brother. How are any of these people who are seeing [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=431.6s)]
*  this on a daily basis while US provided fighter jets fly overhead dropping bombs [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=437.2s)]
*  on them and destroying 80% of residential infrastructure in Gaza ever [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=444.12s)]
*  going to have anything resembling a stable or normal or healthy life. Where [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=450.52s)]
*  are these 2 million 2.2 million people go or whatever the number is left by the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=456.48s)]
*  time the Israelis are done how are they ever going to live in a any semblance of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=461.36s)]
*  a civilized society when you have these children who are living through the most [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=468.48s)]
*  horrific traumas imaginable and if you want to justify the Israeli attack on [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=472.68s)]
*  Hamas at least recognize the realities of what's going on you can see it on [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=481.84s)]
*  video every single day that there are innocent people and women and children [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=486.56s)]
*  who make up the vast majority of people who are being killed and the ones not [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=492.08s)]
*  being killed are being routinely subjected to these sorts of unimaginably [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=496.28s)]
*  indescribable traumatic experiences. Let's watch the rest of this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=503.8s)]
*  They scream at a child telling him to find cover. By this stage the man's wife [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=512.96s)]
*  his widow has heard what happened and as she rushes to the scene she meets the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=523.84s)]
*  party carrying away the body on a makeshift stretcher. When they're [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=530.4s)]
*  satisfied they're a safe distance away they stop and the morning starts. These [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=536.92s)]
*  tragic scenes have been repeated time and time again since this war began. This [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=547.68s)]
*  war is not producing anything good unless you're somebody who sees the world [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=555.88s)]
*  as some sort of a neocon kind of post 9-11 civilization battle where on the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  one side you have the enlightened elevated advanced people of real value [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=568.2s)]
*  namely white Westerners and their allies and then on the other side you have the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=575.2800000000001s)]
*  primitive dangerous Muslim hordes that was the primary neocon view after 9-11 [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=580.28s)]
*  that they tried to convince Americans that all of Israel's enemies in the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=586.48s)]
*  region Muslims and Arabs were our enemies were the enemies of the West and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  therefore we should be happy when they're killed. Absent that view that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  neocon central defining neocon view it is impossible to look at this and say [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=598.52s)]
*  that there is anything good taking place here even from the Israeli perspective. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvMK6pGRAQ&t=603.76s)]
