# "They're done." Google Loses *Massive* Lawsuit Against Epic Games, w/ Matt Stoller
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE)
*  In a courtroom in San Francisco this week, Google suffered what might be one of its worst [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=0.0s)]
*  defeats ever, if not its worst defeat ever, when it lost a major antitrust case brought [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=13.42s)]
*  by the creator of Fortnite that claimed that its Google stores as used on Android phones [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  was a violation of antitrust laws. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=25.38s)]
*  The jury took three hours, four hours at most of deliberation to find in favor of the plaintiff [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=27.8s)]
*  against Google on all 11 counts of antitrust violations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=34.28s)]
*  This comes as the Justice Department is headed toward trial or verdict with Google over the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=38.56s)]
*  much bigger case about whether Google's search engine and the way it uses this against competitors [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=43.78s)]
*  is a violation of antitrust law. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=48.56s)]
*  There's all sorts of other procedures and court processes and government and regulatory [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  into Google on antitrust grounds and it could very well be that this is a serious threat [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=56.88s)]
*  to Google to talk about this case and its implications. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=62.0s)]
*  We have called our good friend of the show and I think one of the leading experts on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=64.72s)]
*  antitrust in Google, Matt Stoller, back to the show to help us understand all of this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=69.68s)]
*  Matt, good evening. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=73.88s)]
*  Thanks for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=74.88s)]
*  Hey, thanks for having me. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=76.72s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=79.0s)]
*  Not always, sometimes good to see you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=80.0s)]
*  Tonight's good to see one of those. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=81.44s)]
*  Let me ask you just about this case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=84.28s)]
*  First of all, go ahead and tell us what it is that we should know about this case where [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=86.16s)]
*  Google just lost in front of a jury on 11 counts of antitrust violations. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=90.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is a huge deal. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=94.84s)]
*  This is a multi-trillion dollar corporation, almost like a private government, private [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=98.0s)]
*  almost central organ for Google. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=102.4s)]
*  Yeah, sorry, in global. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  Which multi-trillion dollar big tech corporation are we talking about? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=107.72s)]
*  Controls, whenever we have a question, Google controls the answers that we get. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=112.44s)]
*  You can call it global sensor, whatever. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  It's very, very powerful. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=121.36s)]
*  It's also one of several really powerful big tech firms. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=122.72s)]
*  None of them have ever lost a major antitrust case. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=126.56s)]
*  Now for the first time, a jury in San Francisco, the heart of big tech countries said Google [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=130.6s)]
*  has violated the law. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=136.28s)]
*  They are a law breaker. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=137.82s)]
*  They are a monopolist. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=139.06s)]
*  That is a huge deal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=140.88s)]
*  As you mentioned, there's a number of other cases that are saying Google is too powerful [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=142.48s)]
*  in these different ways. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=146.84s)]
*  There's also cases against Amazon. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=147.84s)]
*  There's some against Facebook. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=149.24s)]
*  There will probably be some against Apple and maybe Microsoft. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=150.96s)]
*  This is, I think, hopefully the beginning of a wave of allegations that these companies [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=155.12s)]
*  have been violating the law and then a restructuring of these companies so that we can actually [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=161.48s)]
*  have some control over our society again. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=165.72s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=167.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=168.64s)]
*  Let's talk about this case, though, just to understand specifically what was alleged here [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=169.92s)]
*  and what the jury found. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=173.0s)]
*  The case that the Justice Department has brought against Google that is now into this trial [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=174.56s)]
*  stage that you and I have talked about before on this show is one that really goes to the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=179.2s)]
*  heart of Google's business, to its search engines, the way it disadvantages its competitors, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=182.88s)]
*  what's its search engine dominance. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=187.56s)]
*  This case wasn't about its search engines, but instead was about the dominance Google [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=189.3s)]
*  exercises through its Google Play Store on Android phones and its ability to charge fees [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=193.32s)]
*  and to use its ad business in conjunction with this Play Store. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=199.64s)]
*  What specifically was the kind of antitrust violation the jury found Google had to have engaged in? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=203.4s)]
*  Yeah, so we either have in our phones an Apple phone or an Android Google phone, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=210.12s)]
*  These are supercomputers that are in all of our pockets and they are basically digital [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  leashes that track us and we do a lot of commerce through them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Google and Apple not only surveil us, they also take a vig, they take a piece of every [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=224.0s)]
*  time we transact and buy an app, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=228.72s)]
*  So this claim was from Epic Games, which is they make video games, they make a number [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=231.52s)]
*  of software that goes into other video games and they said, you know what, we are tired [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=237.26s)]
*  of having to go through the Google Play Store to get an app onto an Android phone because [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=243.46s)]
*  what Google does is they say, look, if you want to get an app onto an Android phone, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=249.16s)]
*  you have to sell it through our app store. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=253.46s)]
*  There's no technical reason for this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=255.24s)]
*  They just like, you have to sell through our app store and you have to use our payment [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=256.8s)]
*  system. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=260.04s)]
*  Basically, they're credit card processor. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=261.04s)]
*  But unlike a normal payment credit card processor, which charges like 2% or 1% or 3%, Google [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=262.04s)]
*  charges 30%. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  And so they're like, you have to go through the Google Play Store. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  So that's the only store for apps and we're going to charge 30%. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  And Epic, a number of other companies sued, but Epic, the CEO was really mad and he said, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=276.44s)]
*  I'm not going to settle. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=281.44s)]
*  And it went to a jury and the jury said, yup, Google is monopolizing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=283.36s)]
*  They are forcing companies to use their, it's called a tying claim, but they are forcing [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=287.8s)]
*  companies that want to sell through their app store to use their payment system and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=294.44s)]
*  they're taking that 30%. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=298.68s)]
*  And now it's going to go to a remedy phase where a judge is going to say, all right, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=300.48s)]
*  you break in the law. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=304.76s)]
*  You have to either maybe allow other companies to have app stores on the Android phone or [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=306.48s)]
*  You can't force companies to use your payment system or you have to spin off Android, whatever [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  it is. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=319.0s)]
*  The judge could actually break them up if he wanted. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=320.0s)]
*  It'll also likely be appealed, but it's a huge deal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=321.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was going to say. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=323.88s)]
*  There's appeals, there's the question of the remedy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=326.36s)]
*  But nonetheless, I think for Google to be in a courtroom and to actually go take an [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=329.0s)]
*  to its conclusion and to lose in front of a jury, I would think has to be pretty rattling [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=336.64s)]
*  to them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  On the other hand, there's this kind of cynicism that this handful of companies, Google, Amazon, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=344.4s)]
*  Apple and Facebook are so gigantic. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  They're wealthier than a lot of countries. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=354.52s)]
*  They're more powerful than a lot of countries. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=357.64s)]
*  I think there's a lot of skepticism almost inherent that at the end of the day, they're [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  just not going to be held accountable in a meaningful way just because they have too [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=365.04s)]
*  much power to allow that to happen. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=370.36s)]
*  Do you see this as a real sign that Google is in trouble with all of these other cases [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=373.0s)]
*  that are now pending? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they're done. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  It'll take five years. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  But look, there's four other major anti-drug cases and that involve other parts of their [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=383.32000000000005s)]
*  business. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  There's likely going to be more than that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  There are also significant cases about privacy violations, various ways that Google's been [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=391.52s)]
*  allegedly deceiving users. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=396.4s)]
*  The thing is that in each of these cases, it's going to be a litigator usually up in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  front of a judge who decides what was cool about this one is this jury. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=403.32s)]
*  But now, as well as I do, the judges are cowards and they never like to break precedent, especially [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  against a large company like Google. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, now a jury's already done it and in every case, the lawyers are going to be like, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=416.32s)]
*  We know that Google's a lawbreaker already because that's what they were found, that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=421.32s)]
*  they broke the law in this other case. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=425.56s)]
*  So let's talk about their lawbreaking in this instance. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=427.52s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, the precedent is such that these cowardly judges are going [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=430.28s)]
*  to have to find a reason to rule for Google instead of before when they had to find a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=435.8s)]
*  reason to rule against Google. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=441.24s)]
*  And I think it's going to flip all of these cases to be much harder for Google to win [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=443.6s)]
*  them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  And ultimately, over the next five years, there are going to be appeals and stuff like [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=449.76000000000005s)]
*  that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=452.32000000000005s)]
*  But over the next five years or so, I suspect that Google's just going to start settling. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=453.32000000000005s)]
*  They're going to start agreeing to split off pieces because they know they're going to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=458.04s)]
*  lose. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  There's lots of legal uncertainty. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  And I know there's a lot of cynicism, but this is actually how we restructure these [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  companies. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's actually sort of astonishing that it's working. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you know, we talked about before this kind of... [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=474.28s)]
*  I had Senator Mike Leon, my show last night, we were talking about the attempt by the Biden [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=477.36s)]
*  White House working with members of both parties to not only extend, but to expand the power [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=483.0s)]
*  of the FBI and the NSA to spy on Americans en masse without warrants. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=489.44s)]
*  And we were discussing the fact that people hear that, they kind of know it's a bad thing, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=494.0s)]
*  that it's a difficult task to get them to understand viscerally why it really matters [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=499.0s)]
*  to them, like why it really affects their lives in a negative way. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=503.88s)]
*  And I think that's the same as antitrust issues. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=508.04s)]
*  And we've talked about before the reason why people should care. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=511.52s)]
*  And I told you this story that was really when I started working with Rumble, that I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=513.72s)]
*  saw Google's ability to use its search engine dominance to just bury anybody they want that's [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=518.64s)]
*  a competitor to their other businesses like YouTube. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=524.24s)]
*  And people in the audience should try and go do it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=526.8800000000001s)]
*  Think of a show that you remember we did and try and go to Google and find it by entering [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=529.44s)]
*  the title or the general topic with my name in Rumble and see if you can find this video. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=534.72s)]
*  I have a hard time finding my own videos if I don't know the exact name as they appear [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=538.72s)]
*  on Rumble. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=543.36s)]
*  And even then, the search engine will usually point me to the clip of it we post on YouTube, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=544.36s)]
*  even though the viewership is like 1 20th of what it gets on Rumble. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=549.2s)]
*  And you can really see how Google with this dominance that it has in the search engine [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=553.88s)]
*  can just bury other companies, especially ones that compete with them in other areas. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  And so it makes this idea of competition a joke because of just how monopolistic they [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=562.88s)]
*  are. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=568.64s)]
*  Is this a sign that these other companies that have also been labeled monopolies by [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=570.0s)]
*  the relevant committee of the US Congress, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple also are in trouble [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  in similar ways to the way Google is in your view? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=580.88s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=583.96s)]
*  And one of the reasons is because this was not a government suit. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=586.52s)]
*  One of the key distinctions between the way that the US works and the way Europe works [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=590.08s)]
*  is in Europe, they have these big government agencies that do stuff for the public, whereas [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=594.92s)]
*  in the US, we have you bring cases yourself, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=599.32s)]
*  Like Rumble's bringing a case or class action lawyers can do it, right? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  You don't have to rely on the government or bureaucrats or politicians. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=607.08s)]
*  You can bring a case yourself. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=610.88s)]
*  And that's what's so exciting about this is Epic Games brought the case. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=612.52s)]
*  These are very hard to win or traditionally very hard to win. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=615.84s)]
*  And they won. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=618.76s)]
*  And now what I'm seeing is all of these like fancy law firms are actually who always defended [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=619.76s)]
*  these big companies. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=625.32s)]
*  They're starting to realize, oh, wait a second, maybe we can build a bigness going after these [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=626.32s)]
*  companies. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=629.64s)]
*  And you're starting to see you just saw today, a private company filed a suit against Amazon [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=630.64s)]
*  for targeting them in their retail store. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=635.76s)]
*  And so I think you're going to see a ton of companies starting to file suits against [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=640.12s)]
*  big tech. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=647.6s)]
*  And I mean, you know how like you talk a lot about Bill Ackman and like one of the things [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=648.6s)]
*  that's going on with in these is like rich, powerful dudes, like they like to fight over [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=652.28s)]
*  annoying things in universities because it gives them a thrill. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=658.0s)]
*  And it's like here you have the guy behind Epic is a guy named Tim Sweeney. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=662.4s)]
*  And like what he did is the right thing that you should do if you're an angry billionaire [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=667.6s)]
*  that wants some sort of justice as he took on Google. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=672.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=675.08s)]
*  And that's the kind of thing that you hopefully will see. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=676.08s)]
*  We'll see like people who really, you know, who have some power in our society are actually [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=677.6800000000001s)]
*  going to start targeting the real oppressors that are that we're facing, which are like [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=683.9200000000001s)]
*  these big tech firms and other other dominant firms, not just not just big tech, but across [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  the economy. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=693.4s)]
*  I'm dismissive of what Bill Ackman is doing because I don't know if you know this, I don't [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=694.6s)]
*  know if you heard this part, but he said last week, quote, I have been called brave for [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=697.16s)]
*  my tweets over the last few weeks. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=702.68s)]
*  The same could be said for those called who called out Joseph McCarthy during the Red [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=705.16s)]
*  Scare. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  So apparently there are a lot of people in Bill Ackman's immediate vicinity who are telling [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=710.4399999999999s)]
*  him Bill, you're an American billionaire and you're defending Israel. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=714.4s)]
*  Do you know how risky and dangerous that is? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=718.96s)]
*  There's this long line of people who are billionaires who have supported Israel, who [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=721.32s)]
*  have been put into gulags or even killed. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=725.12s)]
*  And yet you're going forth and doing it anyway, just like the people who stood up to Joseph [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=727.2s)]
*  McCarthy, even though Bill Ackman is the one maintaining the blacklist and trying to weed [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  out dissidents from universities. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=737.88s)]
*  But anyway, I digress because I just wanted to put in a word of defense for Bill Ackman [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=740.08s)]
*  since you were so harsh about him. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=743.5200000000001s)]
*  I just tweaked you with Bill Ackman. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=744.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=746.32s)]
*  You promoted me to that tweet. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=747.32s)]
*  It's my fault. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=749.6400000000001s)]
*  Can I say something about the FBI? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=751.12s)]
*  Because I think this is something that's pretty interesting. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=752.64s)]
*  One of the things about J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI that was good is that they actually [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=754.52s)]
*  did some stuff on antitrust. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=760.08s)]
*  People don't know this because it's not written about. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=761.88s)]
*  But the FBI was originally one of their charges and they used to investigate antitrust. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=764.4s)]
*  Since they turned to counterterrorism in 2005 or so, they've stopped doing basically any [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=771.0s)]
*  work on antitrust. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=776.42s)]
*  One of the things that might be kind of interesting to ask, and they don't want to, to kind of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=778.52s)]
*  ask and note is that the FBI really has white collar crime. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=783.12s)]
*  One of the things that's actually bad about the FBI doing all sorts of this stupid stuff [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=789.36s)]
*  is that they're not actually going after white collar crime collusion, raising your prices [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=793.5999999999999s)]
*  on food or medicine or controlling speech or all these things that require deep investigation. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=801.58s)]
*  We have this huge policing agency that's supposed to look at this stuff but isn't. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=810.0200000000001s)]
*  I think that'd be kind of like an interesting thing to start sort of prodding people is [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=815.5400000000001s)]
*  like, why isn't the FBI doing useful things like actually looking into corporate collusion? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=819.0600000000001s)]
*  They used to do that. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=825.14s)]
*  And instead they're doing like this kind of weird and annoying stuff that I think we can [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=826.46s)]
*  all agree is the very, the best, the kindest way to put it is that it's useless. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=832.1s)]
*  I think only Matt Stoller could find the good in J. Edgar Hoover based on antitrust activities. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=836.98s)]
*  But actually, let me follow up on that a little bit because... [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=841.26s)]
*  That was probably the wrong way to say, hey, you know, we should do antitrust like J. Edgar Hoover. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=845.46s)]
*  Yeah, the weird segue, especially when talking to me. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=848.5s)]
*  Hey, let me tell you one of the good things about J. Edgar Hoover. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=850.5s)]
*  The thing is though, Matt, I'm not exactly known as a fan of the Biden administration, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=853.42s)]
*  but I do think one of the things he did that deserved a lot of praise that I praised him for [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=860.22s)]
*  is appointing to the as chair of the FTC, Lena Kahn, who has a long history of doing something [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=864.82s)]
*  that a lot of people on the American right said they wanted done, which is confrontations [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=870.66s)]
*  with Big Tech over its sprawling massive power. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=874.86s)]
*  And I think there was a first, and we've talked about this before, some skepticism about a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=878.1s)]
*  Democrat standing up to Big Tech because there was an assumption that when Democrats stand up [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=882.06s)]
*  to Big Tech, it's because they demand more censorship power, which is more censorship. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=886.6199999999999s)]
*  Well, we demand you Facebook and Google censor more hate speech, but that's not what Lena Kahn [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=891.26s)]
*  has been doing. She's been attempting to say these companies are way too powerful to be [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=896.38s)]
*  consistent with a healthy democracy. She's been confronting them in a lot of ways. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=901.54s)]
*  She continued this suit against Google or supported their suit against Google that was [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=905.38s)]
*  started by the Trump administration. This is the thing that the Trump administration talked a lot about, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  confronting Big Tech in a way that Lena Kahn is doing. And yet you've had these incessant attacks on her. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=913.98s)]
*  Here you have just today a new article from New York Magazine, which is a liberal magazine. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=920.18s)]
*  And yet here's the headline. Lena Kahn's rough year when a liberal star took over the FTC, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=926.42s)]
*  she was expected to break up big business. Instead, critics say she's broken the agency. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=931.62s)]
*  Is this just the kind of influence that these Big Tech companies who hate her have and it's [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=937.82s)]
*  manifesting in these kinds of articles or is there something more substantive going on and why she's [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=943.74s)]
*  being so publicly vilified? No, I mean, it's ridiculous. Like the guy who wrote that article [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=949.4200000000001s)]
*  used to work at Paul Weiss, which is a major big law firm and, you know, that represents, I don't know, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=956.62s)]
*  Amazon and Facebook and so on and so forth. And the way he wrote that article, and this is [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=962.46s)]
*  consistent, like this isn't a one off. It happens, you know, there's lots and lots of articles on how [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=967.02s)]
*  terrible Lena Kahn is and her counterpart at the antitrust division, Jonathan Cantor. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=972.54s)]
*  You can go on to CNBC. You can see like just anywhere where like big money is talking. They [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=976.78s)]
*  just like despise these people. And what this guy did is he talked to all of the, he's like, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=981.5s)]
*  I did interviews with a bunch of people who have left the agency and they don't like her. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=988.22s)]
*  And it's like, well, of course they don't like her. Like she changed things so that the agency [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=992.14s)]
*  would take on Big Tech and take on, you know, Big Pharma and various companies like that. And [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=996.06s)]
*  they're mad because like I said, they left and now they work for Big Tech and Big Pharma and so on [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1002.06s)]
*  and so forth. And what's crazy about this situation is like the author of that article said, look, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1007.02s)]
*  Lena Kahn, because, you know, some people don't like her, might jeopardize the ability to [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1011.9s)]
*  revolutionise antitrust. And that article came out literally 5am the day after Google lost its [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1017.9799999999999s)]
*  first antitrust case. And that's what New York Magazine actually thought was interesting and [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1024.86s)]
*  what they thought that people should know about antitrust and anti-monopoly. In addition to that, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1030.86s)]
*  and this is something people didn't notice because the Google case overshadowed it, but the FTC [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1035.6599999999999s)]
*  yesterday, like the day before this case came out, sued a pharmaceutical company that charges [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1041.1s)]
*  for a rare disease called the Pompe disease. They charge $750,000 a year for treatment and they were [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1049.1s)]
*  trying to buy what was a potential rival and Lena Kahn's FTC blocked that, said you can't do that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1057.02s)]
*  And then they walked away from the deal. So we'll probably bring competition and reduce the price [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1063.6599999999999s)]
*  eventually. And she's very successful. I mean, nobody thinks that these companies should be able [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1068.3s)]
*  to charge $750,000 a year for these kinds of treatments. And every biotech venture capitalist [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1072.86s)]
*  and biotech person on Wall Street was just fuming at the mouth. Like how dare someone come in and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1078.46s)]
*  say, you can't block, no one should be able to block us from financing companies who are going [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1084.22s)]
*  to charge $750,000 a year or a million dollars a year for a treatment for a rare disease. How dare [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1090.06s)]
*  someone do that? And that's like happening across a lot of different industries, these egregious [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1095.42s)]
*  cheating and corrupt practices happening in corporate America. Finally, a few people in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1100.8600000000001s)]
*  certain factions of the Biden administration are doing something about it. And there's some hold [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1106.78s)]
*  over from the Trump administration. It's not a partisan thing. And the fury from the big law [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1111.1s)]
*  people, oh, the guy, by the way, who wrote this is a Democrat. So just like it's an intra-party [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1117.18s)]
*  dispute. And you see similar fury on the Republican side with Republicans who want to do something [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1121.66s)]
*  about concentrated power. And then Republican big law people who are angry about it. Like a couple of, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1126.94s)]
*  I don't know, months ago, George P. Bush had an article in the Wall Street Journal being like, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1133.58s)]
*  I'm really mad at Republicans for supporting antitrust. George P. Bush. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1137.18s)]
*  George P. Bush, I know. It was hilarious. But that's what you see. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1143.18s)]
*  Yeah. No, I mean, this is if you're going to take on big business and big tech and corporate America [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1147.82s)]
*  and stand up for the consumer, which are the people who pay the prices for these unscrupulous [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1154.22s)]
*  practices, you're going to end up as the subject of hit pieces and the kinds of magazines that [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1157.82s)]
*  listen to those powerful factions. That's really almost a prerequisite to be able to prove that [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_rT43wFGE&t=1163.5s)]
