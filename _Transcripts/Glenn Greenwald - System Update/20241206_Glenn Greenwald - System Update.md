# Catherine Herridge On Plummeting Trust In Media: "It's About Getting Major Stories Wrong"
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ)
*  As somebody who has devoted four decades and plus to journalism and somebody who's obviously [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=0.0s)]
*  so passionate about it that you're willing to kind of put yourself on the line for it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=14.64s)]
*  as you've done, polls have consistently shown this disturbing pattern, which I understand [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=19.64s)]
*  but is nonetheless disturbing over the past decade and especially over the past several [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=26.2s)]
*  years that collapse of faith and trust in this profession is accelerating, I mean is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  spiraling out of control. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=36.6s)]
*  Why do you think that is and what steps do you think the media and journalism can take [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  to try and reverse and restore that trust? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=45.08s)]
*  Well, Glenn, I think we're at a very interesting inflection point. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=48.08s)]
*  I think one of the reasons that we've seen so many people exodus from traditional or [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  corporate media outlets is that there is this loss of trust and it's combined now with the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=58.16s)]
*  technology that provides an exit ramp to other outlets. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=63.48s)]
*  If you think back 10 years ago, if people didn't like what they were watching or reading, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=67.0s)]
*  they didn't have as many options or alternatives, but that has totally changed with the technology. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=71.4s)]
*  I mean the loss of trust is simple in a lot of ways. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  It's about getting major stories wrong. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=82.12s)]
*  It's about journalists who are handed talking points who don't even have like a scintilla [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=85.84s)]
*  of curiosity to take it a step further to understand whether that even makes sense. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=91.0s)]
*  So you look at the Russia collusion story, that fell apart. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  You look at the claims about the Hunter Biden story, that fell apart. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=102.2s)]
*  When you have 51 former intelligence officials say it looks like, has the earmarks of a Russian [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=106.84s)]
*  information operation, that falls apart. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=111.68s)]
*  And part of it in journalism, as hard as it can be sometimes, is acknowledging to your [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=115.76s)]
*  audience that you have made a mistake or you reported with the most accurate information [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=120.68s)]
*  you have at the time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  But news is evolving and you have more information which has changed the context and the texture [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=128.32s)]
*  of the reporting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  And there's very, very little of that now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  It's hard to do and it's not comfortable, but I think that's part of the contract with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=138.12s)]
*  the public is being honest and transparent about the information you're reporting and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=142.24s)]
*  also understanding that it may change over time and that you have an obligation to tell [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=147.84s)]
*  them that your understanding of something really has changed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=152.32s)]
*  It's maybe not what you thought two years or six months earlier. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=156.68s)]
*  Yeah, just to underscore that point. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=159.72s)]
*  I mean 20 years ago when the New York Times ran a bunch of stories on the front page of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=161.76s)]
*  about the Iraqi WMD program that even the government admitted turned out to be false, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=166.32s)]
*  they felt this obligation to their readers to confront what they did and they said, here's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=171.28s)]
*  what we got wrong, here's why it happened, here are the measures we're going to take [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=176.04s)]
*  in the future to ensure that this sort of excessive credence that we placed in unnamed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=179.16s)]
*  intelligence officials doesn't happen again. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=187.72s)]
*  And now you have very similar mistakes of the kind of magnitude of the Russiagate conspiracy [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  theory that Robert Mueller couldn't find evidence for, the Hunter Biden laptop that justified [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  censorship right before the 2020 election that everyone now admits was purely accurate [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=201.6s)]
*  and there's zero, and I could go on and on and on, there's zero sense of obligation to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=205.76s)]
*  even acknowledge that there was anything that got done wrong, let alone try and confront [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=211.12s)]
*  it in that kind of a direct way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  And I agree with you completely. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=218.64s)]
*  I don't think Americans expect any institution to be perfect, but especially an institution [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=219.84s)]
*  like journalism that calls on others to be accountable will immediately lose all credibility [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=226.0s)]
*  if they don't provide any accountability themselves and I also think that's one of the things [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=230.52s)]
*  that has been most damaging. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, Kather, this is a story that I care a lot about. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=239.08s)]
*  As I think you know, one of the organizations sponsoring the Press Act that is working with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=243.28s)]
*  you is the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I co-founded with people like Daniel [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=246.8s)]
*  Alsberg and Laura Poitras and Edward Snowden worked on that organization for a long time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=249.84s)]
*  So we're going to continue to follow this story. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm so appreciative that you're fighting this fight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=257.36s)]
*  If there's any way that we can ever be of help, let us know and we love to have you [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=260.12s)]
*  back on as hopefully you get a positive development in the appellate court. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=263.52s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=269.16s)]
*  I'd love to come back. Thank you, Glenn. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfIhUT-KibQ&t=270.0s)]
