# How Corporate Greed Caused Boeingâ€™s Door Disaster, w/ Matt Stoller
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ)
*  There's this there was this harrowing footage like everybody's worst nightmare [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  who flies of this gigantic hole in the fuselage of a Boeing 737 from America [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=10.4s)]
*  from Alaska Airlines and it turns out there has been a lot of warnings a lot [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=17.56s)]
*  of warning signs with this particular plane that for whatever reason didn't [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=22.16s)]
*  get a lot of attention and I think a lot of the attention journalistically got [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=26.8s)]
*  devoted and understandably so to this just standing like revolving door [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=31.6s)]
*  aspect of how the industry of which Boeing is a part they had Nikki Haley on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=35.52s)]
*  the board they have a lot of friendly regulators inside the government who [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=41.0s)]
*  worked in this industry go to the government come back that famous [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  revolving door but there's also a significant antitrust component to how [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=48.08s)]
*  Boeing has consolidated power and the ways in which that has resulted in some [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=53.74s)]
*  of these problems talk about what those antitrust issues are within this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  industry yeah no it's a so I wrote I wrote a wrote this up in 2019 when the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=62.5s)]
*  problems with the 737 max first became really obvious with multiple plane [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=71.98s)]
*  crashes so Boeing was for most of the 20th century an engineering marvel I [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=77.14s)]
*  mean it was a place run by engineers they designed the B 52 in a in a weekend [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=83.06s)]
*  they bet the company on 707 I mean it really transformed one of these sort of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  institutional jewels of America in the world and in the 1990s this changed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=94.78s)]
*  right how did we get from this incredible company to a company that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  can't do anything or you know they they screw up a lot they built a lunar module [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=107.82s)]
*  they're amazing or they were amazing well what happened is in the 1990s the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=112.74s)]
*  Clinton administration said hey we have too many defense contractors the Cold [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=118.94s)]
*  War is over and we're gonna cut spending but we don't want your profits to go [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=125.74s)]
*  down so why don't you guys all merge with one another and the Pentagon [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=131.14s)]
*  actually paid the merger costs and also ripped up a bunch of procurement rules [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=134.42s)]
*  and one of the mergers that took place was Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=140.22s)]
*  McDonnell Douglas was a kind of a disaster as an aerospace company there [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=145.38s)]
*  have been a series of aerospace mergers throughout the 60s 70s 80s and 90s and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=151.9s)]
*  this was the final one this was the only two remaining civilian aircraft [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=156.26s)]
*  manufacturers of a certain size getting together and so Boeing would now be the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=160.7s)]
*  monopolist over the only producer in America aside and there's globally there [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=165.5s)]
*  was also Airbus but that's the whole US aerospace industry and then proceed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=171.18s)]
*  because it had no competition at least domestically it's you know the only [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=178.98s)]
*  thing that the management was focused on was squeezing more revenue from tax [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=185.5s)]
*  concessions from offshoring from laying people off and then from squeezing costs [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=190.94s)]
*  out of the manufacturing process instead of trying to innovate instead of having [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=197.06s)]
*  the engineers design cool things the Jack Welch MBAs got put in charge and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=201.74s)]
*  that you know you fast forward 10 15 20 years and you get disasters like the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=205.94s)]
*  Dreamliner the 77 Dreamliner and and then the 737 Max and the 737 Max happened [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=211.82s)]
*  in 2019 we've known about this catastrophe the CEO had to resign and yet [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=217.86s)]
*  they didn't really change the culture they put another Jack Welch private [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=224.10000000000002s)]
*  equity guy named David Calhoun in charge and so you fast forward to today and you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  know you've got an emergency exit door that they didn't screw the bolts on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=233.12s)]
*  because they're using some dumbass supplier Spirit aerospace systems and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=238.22000000000003s)]
*  they're they're not investing in in good workers or in good production processes [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=242.3s)]
*  it's basically they're just tossing the institution on the trash heap as often [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=246.86s)]
*  happens when you monopolize an industry because there's no one else to go to so [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=251.3s)]
*  what one of the the topics you just touched on is one I'm really interested [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  in I was just by coincidence when I was doing a bunch of research on Bill Ackman [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=261.98s)]
*  over the past several weeks just because like this person kind of materialized [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=266.26s)]
*  out of nowhere I mean he's obviously been very influential in the finance [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=270.3s)]
*  world that's how he got to be a billionaire but he's now like you know [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  obviously whetting his appetite for using his vast wealth for political [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=276.14s)]
*  power so I think it's kind of important to know like hey who exactly is this [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  person and where did his wealth come from and one of the things that he [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  specializes in is buying companies stripping them all of all its value and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=288.38s)]
*  then driving up the stock price and then selling them and leaving these [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=294.02s)]
*  companies in rooms you know like hauling out American industry and American [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=297.58s)]
*  companies right and this has been you know like look at both if you look at [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=301.94s)]
*  Boeing you know it is leaving aside like the relationship to the military [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=305.04s)]
*  industrial complex it is the kind of thing that to the extent you can find [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=309.56s)]
*  good things about American capitalism it did kind of illustrate this idea that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  you have engineers who invent things you have a labor force that builds things [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  these factories were based in the United States creating a lot of jobs you had [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  labor unions who are fighting for good paying wages for American workers and it [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=327.92s)]
*  was this kind of innovative industry and there have been advances in commercial [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=333.08s)]
*  aviation I think I saw this amazing statistic after hasn't been a fatal [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=337.8s)]
*  crash of American of an American civilian jet and I think 18 years now [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  which is obviously you know very impressive and you know at the same time [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=348.56s)]
*  you have this other part of the economy that no longer focuses on building it's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  just kind of like finance like just wealth being created digitally and on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  paper from these financiers and vulture capitalists that rather than [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=361.76s)]
*  contributing anything or building anything really are about destroying [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=366.48s)]
*  things talk a little bit about that distinction both in terms of how it's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=370.4s)]
*  played out at Boeing but then more broadly in the American economy right no [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=373.96s)]
*  that's exactly that's exactly right and what happens there's a sort of an [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=380.28s)]
*  extractive part of our economy and that's what finance really is finances [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  effectively it's a middleman type of job you're supposed to connect the savings [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=389.04s)]
*  of a nation to the investment you're supposed to run the payment system and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=395.12s)]
*  historically about two cents of every dollar in the economy has gone to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=398.56s)]
*  finance bankers and and other people in that industry today it's about nine [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=402.32000000000005s)]
*  percent right which is a hugely inflated amount and what has happened is that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  instead of you know we used America used to have kind of our institutions run by [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=414.12s)]
*  engineering types and and we prioritized making things whether that's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=418.88s)]
*  good or bad I mean you make you make like it there's there's definitely [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=425.08s)]
*  America did a lot of bad things but like you know we we had a certain economic [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=428.84s)]
*  order if you wanted to get rich you got rich by building a steel plant and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=434.24s)]
*  running it and selling a lot of steel and what has happened and this is this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=438.12s)]
*  is a transformation that really started in the 70s but but picked up steam over [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  time is that is that we started to move to what's called an asset light model of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=447.28s)]
*  of production not really production where we just sort of move stuff offshore [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  and you would you would have a financial overlord class people like Bill Acton [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=458.08s)]
*  there are many others a bureaucratic class or part of it too and they kind [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  of have this tacit deal with like the Chinese Communist Party and other [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=467.11999999999995s)]
*  recipients of offshoring who want to build things for their own strategic [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=472.52s)]
*  reasons and they would kind of like finance that class and we will offshore [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=476.04s)]
*  things and so our working class increasingly has less and less power we [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=480.88s)]
*  increasingly make less and less and more is made abroad but the deal is the US [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  controls the dollar and we we kind of have this financial parasitic class on [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=490.88s)]
*  top that runs things makes geopolitical choices fights over kind of monopoly [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=495.6s)]
*  rents like that's one way to see the fight over Harvard that Bill Ackman is [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  engaged in or a lot of these speech fights it's just a fight among like [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=504.96s)]
*  bureaucrats and billionaires over like over extra rents but that's essentially [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=508.44s)]
*  like the you know you see a kind of like populist resurgence you see a resurgence [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=513.32s)]
*  of unions you see a militant workers who are angry about this you see like a lot [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=518.0s)]
*  a lot of the Trump phenomenon was was a reaction against this you see like a lot [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=523.2s)]
*  of things that we do on antitrust are a reaction against this kind of high [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=528.0s)]
*  finance model of production but that's really like that's I think kind of the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=533.48s)]
*  core conflict in America right now and the cultural stuff is a is really [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=537.8800000000001s)]
*  important is a really important part of it because it's a way of disguising [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  what's really going on where we which is about prioritizing you know the fights [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=546.24s)]
*  among this kind of weird intra like intra elite fights among this weird [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  finance class versus normal people who actually make things and sell things and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=556.2800000000001s)]
*  grow things and do things for a living. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxgyCrjmsQ&t=560.6s)]
