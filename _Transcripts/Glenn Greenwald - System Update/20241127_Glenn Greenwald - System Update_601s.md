# When Did Dems Become The Party Of The Rich? With Matt Stoller
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ)
*  Let me ask you this last question, which I know is your absolute favorite topic to talk [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=0.0s)]
*  about. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=10.08s)]
*  I hope you can stay calm, which is that one of your main critiques forever has been the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=11.08s)]
*  excessive and very toxic influence of Obama world in the Democratic Party. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=16.96s)]
*  You have many, many critiques of the Obama administration. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=22.68s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  You're already looking how excited you are. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  It was preceded by a face of disgust and nausea. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=28.88s)]
*  I thought you were going to actually throw up in front of the camera. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  We're starting to hear stories about the influence that the Obama campaign and the people who [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=36.72s)]
*  orbit it had in the Kamala Harris campaign, including, as I guess you would expect, her [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=42.839999999999996s)]
*  brother-in-law, Tony West, who was the general counsel of Uber. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=49.72s)]
*  We saw this attempt to be populist in the beginning of the Kamala Harris campaign when [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=54.4s)]
*  they were talking about price gouging and price controls. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=58.76s)]
*  Then suddenly, all of that disappeared and it became a much more vaguely centrist, safe, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=61.68s)]
*  conservative in a compartmental and emotional sense. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=69.08s)]
*  What do you think is the ongoing influence of the Obama circle in the Democratic Party [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  and how does that manifest? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=84.72s)]
*  First, I want to go back to something about Trump because I think it's important. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  What I'm looking for, the key tell will be how does he negotiate on taxes because the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=93.4s)]
*  Trump tax cuts expire and are they going to go for the corporate tax cuts or are they [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=99.76s)]
*  going to go for a different approach to taxes where they can get a bunch of stuff for ordinary [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=104.28s)]
*  people and that's what I'm looking at. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=109.92s)]
*  He promised a bunch of that on the trail, no tax on tips and various other things. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=117.4s)]
*  That's what I'm looking to and there are reasons to imagine he could go either way. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=118.4s)]
*  But on to the question that I'm just so glad you asked. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=123.8s)]
*  I know you are. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=127.36s)]
*  I know I gave you that as a present for coming on during Thanksgiving week. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=128.36s)]
*  It was more for you than me. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=132.16s)]
*  Can we put some Lin-Manuel Miranda on the background? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=134.72s)]
*  I'll have the Hamilton soundtrack for you next time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=139.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=141.96s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=142.96s)]
*  I actually remembered the other day that that horrific music was a direct part of the Obama [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=143.96s)]
*  era, of course, the only thing it could have been a part of. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=148.84s)]
*  We could just complain about Hamilton for the rest of the show. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  That would be fine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=156.36s)]
*  Just do an ethos on the evils of Lin-Manuel Miranda. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=157.36s)]
*  I would love that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  All right, we're not going to go there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to focus. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=165.16s)]
*  Got to focus. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=166.16s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, look, the Obama administration, I think, was the tail end of the transformation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=168.8s)]
*  of the Democratic Party from a party of working people to a party of the rich. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of the identity frameworks that I think really were corrupting, you know, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  that killed the more populous parts of the civil rights movement, you know, those manifested [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=191.56s)]
*  in the Obama era in an extreme way. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=196.32s)]
*  And then they spun off a whole set of institutions and networks and political operatives who [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  have a specific way of doing business. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  And they think of the Democratic Party kind of the way that, you know, the libertarians [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  thought of the Republican Party, which is as their vehicle to impose a kind of aristocratic [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  framework with a slightly different flavor of it than the old school Republicans did. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=221.22s)]
*  And that's, I think, what you saw with a lot of the people that Kamala Harris brought in, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=227.38s)]
*  you know, Tony West from Uber and David Plouffe, who was, you know, I don't know how many clients [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=232.42s)]
*  he had, but like, you know, he had to get rid of TikTok, but he could keep the rest [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=237.61999999999998s)]
*  of them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=241.17999999999998s)]
*  I think he helped set up Mark Zuckerberg's foundation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  And then just a ton of the, you know, the Pod Save America guys and, you know, that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  whole network of people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=249.66s)]
*  And, you know, I think Obama himself was, you know, somewhat part of was somewhat part [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=251.18s)]
*  of the thinking. He's always part of that thinking. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=258.7s)]
*  And they really said our model here is to raise money from really, really rich people [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=261.78s)]
*  and to put really rich people out front, because we think that, you know, if the American [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=269.1s)]
*  people are concerned about the economy, they will trust Mark Cuban, rich people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=274.0s)]
*  Like Mark Cuban would be, you know, she kept doing events with him. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=279.74s)]
*  And he kept saying, we need to get rid of tariffs. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=283.58000000000004s)]
*  We need to, you know, do more deregulation and the, you know, the things that you would [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  expect to hear from somebody. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=290.26000000000005s)]
*  I mean, he actually, you know, was taking money from Google at the time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, he was, he was. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=295.26000000000005s)]
*  There were even promises that she had made, she and Waltz had made that were populist in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  nature. And he would openly say in interviews, they're not going to really do that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=302.70000000000005s)]
*  I don't believe they're going to do that. If they were going to do that, I wouldn't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  support them. Like, of course, they're lying about that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=308.26s)]
*  Yeah. No. And I think that's that was sort of the dynamic that was so disturbing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the fulcrum for me was when a bunch of billionaire donors said she's got to get [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=316.18s)]
*  rid of Lena Conn. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=321.38s)]
*  And then there was this fight for months about whether she was going to get rid of Lena [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=322.94s)]
*  Conn or not. And she, you know, their campaign said, oh, we don't want to have to start [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=328.14s)]
*  saying what we'll do with Lena Conn, because if we say that, you know, then we'll have [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=332.34s)]
*  to they'll be asked about every person in the administration. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=335.98s)]
*  And we don't want to do personnel right now, which was just like obvious process garbage [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  from Democrats addicted to process garbage. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  And and so that that was, you know, you can just sort of see that it really drained [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=346.86s)]
*  the Democratic Party and that campaign out of vitality. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=353.14000000000004s)]
*  And I think there are a lot of Democrats that are pretty mad about it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  But, you know, and it did cause a bunch of healthy things. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=359.62s)]
*  I think the collapse of ethnic grievance politics simply because voters just said [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  we're going to vote a number of black working class voters and a number of, you know, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=369.82000000000005s)]
*  you look at every demographic group, but Latinos, Asian Americans, African Americans, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=375.5s)]
*  like actually everyone, but white people swung to Trump. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=380.1s)]
*  And that, I think, is causing real soul searching in white women, white women in [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  particular. Yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=386.86s)]
*  White women. Well, yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, at the same time, I think there is a, you know, I'm a Democrat. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=389.86s)]
*  These people are in my party. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=396.14s)]
*  And it's I really despondent in a lot of ways because they just have terrible ideas [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=397.42s)]
*  about what our society should look like. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  And they have terrible political instincts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=406.42s)]
*  And I just I kind of just want them and like Bill Kristol and Liz Cheney to go off and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  sort of form their own party because they are not the majority of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=415.7s)]
*  Maybe that's just me telling myself that because I want to believe. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=419.34s)]
*  But like that, that is my view. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=422.5s)]
*  And, you know, I but I guess what I just these these people is fundamentally not some [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=424.78s)]
*  people like me and people like them shouldn't be in the same party. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=431.62s)]
*  And I think in the next 10 years, whoever sorts out this realignment, you know, it's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=434.17999999999995s)]
*  that's just the way it's going to wind up. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=439.41999999999996s)]
*  But I don't know if that's going to be the Republicans. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be the Democrats. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=442.78s)]
*  I don't I know. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=444.17999999999995s)]
*  I'm not as confident in Trump, obviously, as a lot of his supporters are. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  But it just doesn't feel like this is a stable political situation. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Look, I think whatever you want to say about Trump, good and bad. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  And there's both that to say about him. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=456.94s)]
*  I do think you cannot deny that there's been a transformative political moment in the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=460.26s)]
*  climate, in the realignment already. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=465.42s)]
*  I think most important figure. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=468.26s)]
*  Yeah. Most important political easily this century. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=470.14s)]
*  Easy. You know, since Reagan or whatever you can say. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=472.82s)]
*  And I think there's been some realignment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think depending on how this obviously this massive migration of voters that the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=478.82s)]
*  Democratic Party has owned lock, stock and barrel for decades, going and voting for [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=484.3s)]
*  Trump is indicative of that enough. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  And I think he has a real opportunity in the second administration to make this an [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=490.65999999999997s)]
*  enduring change. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=494.3s)]
*  As you said, if he just gives Wall Street everything he wants and tariffs skyrocket [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=496.34s)]
*  prices and workers are screwed even more, it's probably going to be they're all going [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=501.26000000000005s)]
*  to come back to the Democrats in twenty twenty six for the same reason they rejected [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=506.1s)]
*  Biden. But if he really and I think Trump is a politically heterodox guy and if he [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=509.02000000000004s)]
*  sort of stays on top of things, not in a micromanage way, but just kind of a bird's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=516.14s)]
*  eye way of not letting any one faction be dominant through kind of sabotaging him and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=520.62s)]
*  undermining him. I do think there's a I'm not saying it's going to happen and it won't [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=526.62s)]
*  shock me if it doesn't. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=531.06s)]
*  But there's a real potential to rearrange the electorate in a way that I consider very [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=532.3399999999999s)]
*  positive so that Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol and David Frum are in the same party as a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=537.78s)]
*  lot of these Democrats. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=545.26s)]
*  And on some level to me, especially if they don't change, that is the place that they [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=546.26s)]
*  belong, unfortunately. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=550.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, one can always hope that they are part of no party or that they end up in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuhVNlGYypQ&t=553.6999999999999s)]
