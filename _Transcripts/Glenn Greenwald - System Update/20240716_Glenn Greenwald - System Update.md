# From the RNC: Michael Tracey Interviews Reps. Spartz and Lawler and Former Gov. Scott Walker
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0)
*  Alright, we are on the floor of the Republican National Convention right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaze out at the amazing sights. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=11.56s)]
*  I've never had more fun in my life. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=15.88s)]
*  I guess what we're going to do is just kind of poke around and see if there's anybody [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=17.82s)]
*  of note to speak to. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=20.46s)]
*  Let's see who I can spot. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=21.96s)]
*  Oh, Power Swim Sparks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Power Swim Sparks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  What's your reaction to the Trump-Rumble? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  What's your reaction to JD Vance getting the nomination? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=34.44s)]
*  You know, I think we have a lot of great candidates. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=35.44s)]
*  We have a very long bench. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  But it's all about President Trump and make America great. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  What do you expect for a second term for President Trump in terms of Ukraine and Israel as compared [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=43.44s)]
*  to the Biden administration? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  I think, you know, as President Trump said, you know, we need to restore peace. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  We need to restore our economy, that we have ability for people to get wealth back and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=54.92s)]
*  have a growth in the economy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=61.68s)]
*  Because right now, inflation and despair is going to destroy a lot of people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  And I think this is something about the future of the country and strengthen the country, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=68.08s)]
*  strengthen the borders, strengthen the people, and really bring peace around the world. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=71.92s)]
*  We have a disaster right now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=76.36s)]
*  It's awful what's happening. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=78.0s)]
*  President Trump has said that he has a good relationship with Zelensky. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=79.48s)]
*  And some people question that because they think he's Putin's puppet or this kind of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=83.04s)]
*  thing, which is silly. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=86.12s)]
*  So what is his relationship with Zelensky in Ukraine? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=87.12s)]
*  Listen, it's not about... [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=90.2s)]
*  Because Representative Sparx, you are Ukrainian, correct? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=92.2s)]
*  Originally I grew up there, but I'll tell you, it's about peace through strength. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=94.6s)]
*  And President Trump had a lot of peace around the world and the aggressors didn't move. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=99.84s)]
*  And his policy is to bring peace and actually put pressure on countries like Russia and China. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=104.2s)]
*  He never gets much credit, but what he created in the Middle East with Abraham Accords, he [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=110.64s)]
*  deterred Russia to move further. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=115.08s)]
*  He was the one who actually put sanctions on Nord Stream 2, forced more production of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=117.08s)]
*  energy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=123.72s)]
*  He was put back on China not to buy... [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=124.72s)]
*  Put many sanctions on Russia? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=126.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=128.2s)]
*  And he is the one who actually forced Europeans and NATO to step up to create more deterrence [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=129.2s)]
*  and spend money to deter Russia. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=133.4s)]
*  He doesn't get a credit for that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  But his foreign policy was pretty powerful. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=136.88s)]
*  Will Trump continue supporting funding for Ukraine? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=139.2s)]
*  I've spoken to other members of Congress in the Senate who said that he supported the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=141.96s)]
*  national security supplemental in April to send many billions to Israel and Ukraine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Will he continue supporting that? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=151.48s)]
*  Well, listen, it's not about... [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=153.2s)]
*  We cannot be stupid how we spend money. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=154.44s)]
*  We need to have strategy and oversight. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=156.84s)]
*  Soviet Union was defeated not by weapons, but by smart strategy, but have smart energy policies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=159.04s)]
*  And that's what it takes in financial policy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=165.0s)]
*  And that's what he can bring to the table. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  Not to have never ending wars where it costs a lot of money and a lot of lives. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=170.28s)]
*  And that's what you have to be much smarter. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  And he's a very smart man. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=176.16s)]
*  What about the Biden administration policy where they allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  to hit certain targets within Russia, but it's never clear what the parameters are? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=182.76s)]
*  It's all politics. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=186.76s)]
*  And ultimately, you know, we have a serious war. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=188.6s)]
*  And we shouldn't be tweeting Biden, you know, what they're doing and threatening, putting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  over Twitter or X and in reality slow-walk the aid. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=196.52s)]
*  OK, we need to have a serious conversation that Putin understand he shouldn't have advancing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=200.44s)]
*  He cannot do what he's going to do, but force Europeans to step up, too. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you think Trump would remove some of the constraints that Biden has tried to impose on Ukraine? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  I think Trump will do whatever it takes to bring peace back. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=212.84s)]
*  And that's what we need. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=215.72s)]
*  And he will stand with allies like Israel. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  He will put pressure on a lot of countries like Europeans that actually been not serious [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=219.44s)]
*  about this situation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=225.04s)]
*  And now it's become a problem for all of us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=226.4s)]
*  And also a serious deal with China that playing games with Iran and Russia to destabilize [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=228.72s)]
*  the whole world and come here. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=233.84s)]
*  So I think he's very serious and he's brilliant on his foreign policy because he's unpredictable. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=235.36s)]
*  That is a lot of aggression. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=241.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=242.72s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=243.72s)]
*  OK, I see Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=244.72s)]
*  So let's go to him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=247.64s)]
*  So I want to ask you a couple of questions about a forthcoming Trump administration and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=248.72s)]
*  Israel policy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=252.32s)]
*  You spent a lot of time on that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=253.32s)]
*  So issues around anti-Semitism. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=254.96s)]
*  Do you expect to be Trump for Trump to be more aggressive in combating anti-Semitism [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=255.96s)]
*  using the mechanisms available in the federal government to pursue some of the initiatives [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=262.08s)]
*  that you've tried to advocate in Congress? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=266.88s)]
*  What's your general synopsis of that? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=270.28s)]
*  Yeah, look, the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act that we passed through the House, 320 to 91, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=271.76s)]
*  codified President Trump's executive order. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=278.64s)]
*  From December 2019, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=281.44s)]
*  Absolutely, which required the Department of Education to adopt the IRA working definition [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=283.04s)]
*  of anti-Semitism and all of its contemporary examples for Title VI violations of the 1964 [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=287.64s)]
*  Civil Rights Act. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=294.32s)]
*  So the president led on this back in 2019. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=295.32s)]
*  And obviously we've seen in the five years since anti-Semitism on the rise, not just [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=298.28s)]
*  here in America, but around the globe, the terrorist attack against the state of Israel [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=304.48s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=309.52s)]
*  And so I absolutely expect that in a second Trump term that he would continue to lead, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  not only in his strong support of Israel. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=317.44s)]
*  Remember, he's the president that moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=319.92s)]
*  He brags about that to this day, very often. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=324.68s)]
*  It's not so much about bragging. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  He did. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=329.36s)]
*  He reminds us. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=330.36s)]
*  He did what other presidents said they would do and did not. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=331.36s)]
*  And I think that speaks volumes, obviously, to his support for Israel, but also, obviously, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=334.56s)]
*  his support of the Jewish people. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=340.76000000000005s)]
*  Now in terms of your legislation that would have required the adoption of the IHRA definition [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=342.44000000000005s)]
*  within the civil rights enforcement framework, do you ever want, there's been some controversy [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=348.72s)]
*  among other conservatives on that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  There was famously a claim that it could have criminalized citing the Bible. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=356.36s)]
*  I'm not endorsing that, but there was some controversy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=360.68s)]
*  Do you ever question the validity of some of the statistics that are used to tabulate [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitic incidents? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=370.32s)]
*  Like, sometimes it's a little bit ambiguous or the criteria, especially for the ADL, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=371.32s)]
*  comes under scrutiny. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  Is there like, is it empirically unassailable that there's been this massive surge? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=376.76s)]
*  Is there any open room for debate or questioning as to whether those statistics are sound? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, first of all, on the issue of the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, it does not ban the Bible. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=386.32s)]
*  It does not criminalize Christianity. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm a practicing Catholic, okay? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=395.28s)]
*  I would not put forth legislation that would do that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=398.16s)]
*  It obviously has First Amendment protections, both in terms of speech and the right to practice [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=401.52s)]
*  one's religion. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=406.96s)]
*  But with respect to stats of anti-Semitism, I don't think anybody really would question [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=408.88s)]
*  that there has been a rise in anti-Semitism. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=416.56s)]
*  When you see what we saw on these college campuses, obviously there's been a rise in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=420.16s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=427.44s)]
*  What statistics somebody cites or how that is compiled, obviously anytime you're looking [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=429.08s)]
*  at stats, you can always look at the numbers and question something. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=435.16s)]
*  But I think part of the reason that we put forth the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act is because [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=439.96s)]
*  these universities and colleges were failing to act, and in part because the definition [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=446.6s)]
*  of anti-Semitism, frankly, at times, is not well understood. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=452.36s)]
*  And it's fluid and it's often contested. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=457.32s)]
*  Well, of course it is, because there are people who hate Jews and they want to say, no, that's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=460.04s)]
*  not anti-Semitic, when in fact it is. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=466.76s)]
*  Part of why I ask this is because if you look at how the ADL, for instance, tabulates that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=470.4s)]
*  data, they will take any pro-Palestinian rally, essentially, or a huge array of pro-Palestinian [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=476.24s)]
*  chants or whatever, that may not be intrinsically anti-Semitic, but they consider it as such [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=484.08s)]
*  and therefore they put it in the database. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=488.64s)]
*  Is that at all warranted to have skepticism about how that is done? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=491.12s)]
*  It's clear, and Congress recognized this, when you engage in a chant from the river [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  to the sea, calling for the eradication of the state of Israel, that is anti-Semitism. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=502.12s)]
*  Even if you're a Jewish activist chanting that? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=506.64s)]
*  It doesn't matter what someone's background or ethnicity or religion is. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=509.52s)]
*  If you are engaged in that kind of conduct, then yes. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=514.28s)]
*  And so... [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=518.72s)]
*  They're self-hating Jews. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=519.72s)]
*  Look, you can label it whatever you want. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=520.72s)]
*  The bottom line is, when you have these incidents, which we have seen throughout the course of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=523.0s)]
*  the last many months, you have seen a rapid rise in anti-Semitism. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=529.56s)]
*  What we are saying as Congress is that these universities, these colleges, have a responsibility [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=534.76s)]
*  to keep these students safe. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=542.16s)]
*  If it was any other group, we know they would crack down on it, because they have when it [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=544.22s)]
*  has popped up. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=549.2s)]
*  But for some reason, under the guise of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=550.48s)]
*  they think it's okay, and it's not. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=558.72s)]
*  One final question. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=559.72s)]
*  Your wife is from Moldova, is that right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=560.72s)]
*  And so you've taken a special interest in Eastern Europe or Ukraine-Russia conflict. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=563.16s)]
*  I've heard you cite that your wife is from Moldova, just throwing it out there. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=568.6s)]
*  The Biden administration doesn't really specify the parameters of this new policy that Biden [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=573.4s)]
*  announced in May, whereby Ukraine can use U.S. weaponry to strike targets inside territorial [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=579.48s)]
*  Russia, but the Biden administration is not telling us what territory exactly. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=585.6s)]
*  It's ambiguous. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=590.0s)]
*  It seems to be just made up on the fly. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=591.04s)]
*  Do you see a problem with that? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=592.84s)]
*  And might Trump resolve that to your liking? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=595.32s)]
*  Well, look, Russia obviously, under the reign of Vladimir Putin, has committed war crimes [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=598.4s)]
*  here in Ukraine. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=608.2s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is a vile thug and dictator. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=610.08s)]
*  And Ukraine, much like other allies of ours, including Israel, has a right to defend itself. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=614.44s)]
*  And I think what, from my vantage point, not only should we be helping Ukraine in terms [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=621.2800000000001s)]
*  of arming them, we should be allowing them to prosecute the war and defend themselves [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=627.6s)]
*  accordingly. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=634.5200000000001s)]
*  Would that include, say, striking Moscow if they felt that that was necessary for their [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=635.5200000000001s)]
*  self-defense? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=639.08s)]
*  At the end of the day, when Russia has invaded Ukraine and is marching towards Kiev, is your [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=640.32s)]
*  position that Ukraine should just roll over? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=648.64s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, they have to be able to not only defend themselves, but [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=651.76s)]
*  push back. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=655.5200000000001s)]
*  And that obviously requires the ability to strike the Russian military within Ukraine [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  and potentially, obviously, looking at strikes in Russia. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=663.64s)]
*  And that is just a reality of war. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=669.44s)]
*  And if anybody thinks that the United States somehow would not defend its country, its [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=671.84s)]
*  borders, its people, they're kidding themselves. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=678.72s)]
*  How do you anticipate Trump and maybe JD Vance navigating that issue? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=681.72s)]
*  Look, Russia, China, and Iran are not our friends. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=685.76s)]
*  Donald Trump knew that and understood that as president of the United States. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  I think it's clear when you look at what has been allowed to happen under Joe Biden that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=696.16s)]
*  we need to combat this malign effort. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=702.64s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  All right, thank you, Congressman. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=710.4799999999999s)]
*  All right, there's Congressman Mike Lawler of New York spelling out some thoughts on [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=712.4799999999999s)]
*  what he anticipates for policy regarding anti-Semitism and Russia-Ukraine. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=718.96s)]
*  There's Scott Walker, former governor of Wisconsin, former presidential candidate. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=726.32s)]
*  Hey, Governor Walker. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=733.44s)]
*  I'm Michael Tracy with Rumble. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=734.08s)]
*  Yeah, good to see you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=735.2800000000001s)]
*  So I don't know about you, but after that terrible incident on Saturday, which I don't [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=736.32s)]
*  even want to think about, but I was struggling how to kind of comfort myself. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=743.52s)]
*  I didn't want to just delve right back into standard politics. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=747.44s)]
*  It felt like there ought to be time to take a pause. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=750.1600000000001s)]
*  Just had to respect for the gravity of the episode. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  How have you been thinking through that dynamic? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  Because whether you like it or not, the convention was right upon us. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=758.32s)]
*  So what's your thought process been like? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=761.36s)]
*  Literally, thank God, by the hand of God, he was spared just by turning his head from [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=763.2s)]
*  a would-be assassin's bullet. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=768.08s)]
*  I thought back as a kid, I was just literally a kid when Ronald Reagan was shot more than [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=770.08s)]
*  four decades ago. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  I remember how shocked I and the rest of America was. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=775.2800000000001s)]
*  Now, he actually had to go in for surgery in the whole bit. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=777.84s)]
*  Here, I mean, I think that pause and then seeing him standing up and then hearing thereafter [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=780.4000000000001s)]
*  that he was survived. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=786.24s)]
*  Such a relief. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=789.12s)]
*  At the same time, we were horrified, upset. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=790.72s)]
*  But you know, that's Donald Trump. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=794.0s)]
*  He's a fighter. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=795.84s)]
*  The idea that anyone would have assumed that under that circumstance, being shoved out [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=796.48s)]
*  into an armored vehicle would be the normal course. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=801.6s)]
*  But here's a guy who wants to let America, not just that crowd know, America know. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=804.24s)]
*  He's not taking it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=808.48s)]
*  He's not backing down. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=809.6s)]
*  I just thought that was indicative of the fighter that has been and will be President [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=811.04s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=815.04s)]
*  So you were governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=818.08s)]
*  See, I know things, people. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm kind of a loser. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=820.0s)]
*  I didn't even have to Wikipedia that. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=821.44s)]
*  And you ran for president in 2016. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=823.04s)]
*  I believe you dropped out September 2015. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=825.36s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=827.2s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=827.6800000000001s)]
*  You were on at least one. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=828.0s)]
*  I got out before I got a nickname. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=829.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=832.32s)]
*  You didn't get I don't want to speculate whatever nickname it might have been. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=832.48s)]
*  But you were on a few debate stages with Trump. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=835.76s)]
*  So an interesting dynamic down Wisconsin is that Tammy Baldwin running for Senate [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=837.76s)]
*  consistently in the polls. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=843.04s)]
*  It's a couple of points, you know, sometimes quite a few points ahead of Biden. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=844.16s)]
*  The Democrats now seem paralyzed into inaction. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=849.04s)]
*  There may have been some momentum to attempt at least to maybe force Biden to reconsider, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=852.4s)]
*  but now everything kind of just got frozen after the incident this weekend. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=857.76s)]
*  What do you make of that dynamic when you compare the senatorial [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=862.72s)]
*  dynamic to the presidential dynamic in Wisconsin? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=866.16s)]
*  Well, I think in the presidency, you've got a clear case where both candidates are known. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=868.48s)]
*  Everybody knows Donald Trump. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  Everybody knows Joe Biden. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=873.76s)]
*  So the no amount of money advantage with the Democrats have will change things. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=875.28s)]
*  And so I think that's really the critical difference. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=879.36s)]
*  People know what they get with Joe Biden. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=881.76s)]
*  And it's a mess. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=883.2s)]
*  It's not just because he's mentally questionable in terms of stability, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=883.84s)]
*  particularly after the debate. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=888.0s)]
*  It's not just because of age. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=889.36s)]
*  It's because his ideas have failed us. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=891.12s)]
*  Americans see it high price of gas, food, housing, you name it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=892.8s)]
*  They see that he's failed on the border. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=896.72s)]
*  He's failed with public safety. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=898.24s)]
*  They know that Donald Trump's going to fight back on those things. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=899.68s)]
*  In the Senate race, I think it's it's a financial advantage. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=902.32s)]
*  She's got ads on all the time. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=905.44s)]
*  He has some, but not nearly enough. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=907.52s)]
*  And then that's part of it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=909.44s)]
*  Combined with the fact that even though she's really, really liberal, that is Tammy Baldwin, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  she's taken adopted strategy many Democrats do, which is keep your mouth shut at home, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=914.8s)]
*  vote crazy in Washington. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=919.52s)]
*  And so her opponent, Eric, he's going to have to expose that. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=921.12s)]
*  Now, are you the chair of this convention or do you have some role at the convention? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=924.4s)]
*  What is your title? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=927.28s)]
*  Tommy Thompson, the former governor and I are the co-chairs or honorary chairs [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=927.92s)]
*  of the former senator of the host committee. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=932.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=934.4799999999999s)]
*  How many times was the senator? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=935.28s)]
*  Right governor. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=936.24s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=937.04s)]
*  Four terms. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=937.28s)]
*  So between us, we have seven statewide wins for governors. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=937.76s)]
*  So they know what they're doing about winning. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=940.56s)]
*  He ran for president as well, right? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=941.92s)]
*  He did. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=943.1999999999999s)]
*  In 2008. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=943.68s)]
*  You're on it, man. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=946.16s)]
*  So what do you make of the prospects for a second Trump term for foreign policy? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=947.6s)]
*  Ukraine and Israel in particular, the two hot button issues. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=954.32s)]
*  JD Vance having been named vice president is going to make the media scream that he's [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=958.24s)]
*  Putin's puppet or this kind of standard nonsense. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=961.52s)]
*  What do you make, like what would you anticipate for a second term Trump policy vis-a-vis Ukraine, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=965.52s)]
*  vis-a-vis Israel that'd be different from the Biden administration? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=969.6s)]
*  Well, if Donald Trump was in his second term right now, Putin wouldn't be there. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=971.76s)]
*  He's not. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=975.04s)]
*  So let's look forward. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=975.36s)]
*  But I think that ties to it because- [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=976.24s)]
*  That's a second guessing or that's counterfactual? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=978.16s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=982.96s)]
*  But Putin didn't make a step in during his four years. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=983.44s)]
*  He went into the Crimean Peninsula under Obama. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=986.48s)]
*  He went even further in under Joe Biden's, particularly after his week in Afghanistan. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=989.6s)]
*  I think peace through strength is something we talked about with Reagan, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  but it's equally as true with Donald Trump. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=997.2s)]
*  Foreign leaders didn't mess around with Donald Trump. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=999.6s)]
*  They won't going forward. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1001.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, Trump did start arming Ukraine and that antagonized Putin. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1003.2s)]
*  He said so in his own speech in February of 2022. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1006.08s)]
*  I think in the end, he knows- the bigger worry to me is not Putin. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1009.12s)]
*  It's the CCP and China. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1012.96s)]
*  China is a much more formidable foe. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1014.48s)]
*  China and Russia are closer than they've ever been, arguably. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what I mean, but that's the bigger thing we should be focused on. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1018.72s)]
*  You look at our southern border, you look at Peter Schweitzer's book, Blood Money, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1021.36s)]
*  he documents how there's 2,000-some Chinese nationalists acting as chemists that are just [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1024.96s)]
*  across our southern border, that they're providing pill presses at cost, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1029.6s)]
*  doing all these things to undermine America from within. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1033.28s)]
*  China's a much more fierce opponent and adversary to the United States right now. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1036.3999999999999s)]
*  I think Donald Trump's been very clear in pushing back against China. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1041.04s)]
*  I think when it comes to Israel- [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1044.3999999999999s)]
*  What does pushing back mean, militarily? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1045.76s)]
*  Well, again, I think you don't need to. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1048.24s)]
*  Ronald Reagan, when I was a kid, the safest time in American history was when, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1049.52s)]
*  eight years, Ronald Reagan was president, and he built up the military. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1053.36s)]
*  Peace through strength wasn't just some slogan. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1056.56s)]
*  People were afraid to mess with Donald Trump in the United States because of his actions. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1058.8s)]
*  Well, there are some conservatives nowadays who at least claim to be [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1062.0s)]
*  skeptical of what they call the military-industrial complex. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1064.32s)]
*  Peace through strength, the cliché, that requires spending massive money [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1067.2s)]
*  on the military budget, payoffs to defense contractors, that sort of thing. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1071.04s)]
*  Is that what we're expecting, ballooning the military budget even further? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  No, I think you should be smart, and the fact is we haven't been for quite some time, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1079.12s)]
*  but we can be highly effective when it comes to military deterrence. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1083.2s)]
*  In the years after Reagan, we have what we called the peace dividend, that by bringing [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1086.88s)]
*  the Soviet Union to their knees, we not only were able to draw down what we had to spend there- [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  Was it in the Clinton administration? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  He claimed that he reaped the peace dividend and could lower military spending. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1097.0400000000002s)]
*  Clinton got it because of Reagan. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1100.5600000000002s)]
*  If the Soviet Union was still a threat, we were still willing with nuclear proliferation, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1102.4s)]
*  it wouldn't have happened. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1106.16s)]
*  Because of Reagan's strength, we had that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1106.96s)]
*  It's precisely why when Democrats will point to that error in having a balanced budget, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1109.2800000000002s)]
*  it was only because of that and because House Republicans held into that. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1113.04s)]
*  But I think going forward, again, it's one of those where we should take care of America first, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1116.6399999999999s)]
*  but at the same time, you can still be a deterrent to people taking aggressive [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1120.72s)]
*  actions around the world just by the virtue of strength. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1124.8s)]
*  All right, thanks, Governor Walker. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wJoM4q9uz0&t=1127.6s)]
