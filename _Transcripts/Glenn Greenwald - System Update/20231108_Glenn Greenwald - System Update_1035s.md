# INTERVIEW: Harvard Students Targeted for Pro-Palestine Views | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw)
*  Tonight, Amari Butler and Kojo Achiyampong are both students at Harvard who have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=0.0s)]
*  very outspoken about the conflict between Israel and Palestine in general and the war [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=12.3s)]
*  in particular. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=16.5s)]
*  As a result of a letter they signed shortly after the Hamas attack on October 7th, they [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=17.5s)]
*  were widely branded as anti-Semites, accused of supporting terrorism. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=22.04s)]
*  They had their faces put on trucks that drive around Harvard voicing these accusations [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=27.1s)]
*  against them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=32.06s)]
*  They had billionaire hedge fund managers organizing public lists with their name on it to prevent [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=33.06s)]
*  them and others from being hired. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=37.7s)]
*  And yet, remarkably and I think quite commendably, they have been quite defiant in the face of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=39.74s)]
*  these threats to their futures and their careers and their reputations. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=44.1s)]
*  And they continue to unapologetically speak out on campus. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=47.22s)]
*  And now tonight on this show, obviously there are going to be some of you who disagree with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  their views, probably strongly, but their story is one that I think merits a lot of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=54.24s)]
*  attention so I'm thrilled to welcome both of them to the show tonight. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  Thank you guys for taking the time to talk to me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=62.72s)]
*  I'm really happy to have you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=64.6s)]
*  Thanks so much for having us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=66.04s)]
*  We're excited to be here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=69.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=70.36s)]
*  And I apologize, Kojo, if I butchered your name, your last name. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=71.36s)]
*  I practiced it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=74.08s)]
*  I thought I had it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=75.08s)]
*  But hopefully I got it at least well enough. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=76.68s)]
*  Let me start by asking you, before we get into your specific views, talk a little bit [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  about what has happened to you as a result of expressing those views since October 7th, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=86.64s)]
*  the kind of attacks on you, the sort of threats to your career, to your future. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Mari, why don't we start with you and go ahead and just talk about some of the things that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  have been done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  So as you know, and as you said, we signed on to Kojo and I. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, it was actually organizations that signed on to a letter written by Harvard PSC, the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=109.52s)]
*  Palestine Solidarity Committee. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  And shortly after, I think about two days later, the first thing that I saw was that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  our names were in like a random tweet and then it was linked a random article on some [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=121.56s)]
*  website calling us like supporters of terrorism on Harvard's campus or something. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=126.64s)]
*  But initially it was just like one or two tweets that I saw retweeting one article [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=131.88s)]
*  link and then very quickly after it kind of just started spiraling where we saw many more [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=136.12s)]
*  tweets, just people retweeting the same thing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=142.24s)]
*  And then soon after, Bill Ackman, hedge fund CEO, tweeted that he wanted us and all the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  other people involved in signing the letter blacklisted from his company and other companies. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=149.92s)]
*  And he said he was like kind of talking with other CEOs that also wanted us blacklisted. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=155.8s)]
*  And then very quickly escalated, when a truck that had like LED screens and our names and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=160.56s)]
*  faces on it kind of started parading around campus calling us Harvard's leading anti-Semites. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=168.68s)]
*  My face was on it and my full name, Kojo's face was on it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=173.4s)]
*  And then like just a bunch of other people that largely, I mean, like organizations signed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  on to it, not even individuals themselves. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=182.12s)]
*  So people that in any way used to be affiliated with the org. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=184.0s)]
*  I mean, there were people that were docs that graduated years ago that weren't even on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=188.64s)]
*  campus when this happened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=194.28s)]
*  But anyone that was affiliated with any of these orgs at any capacity at any point in time, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=195.56s)]
*  many were docs, their names, name, family information, even in some cases were publicly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=201.72s)]
*  And I mean, it was just really shameful. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=208.56s)]
*  I mean, these attacks largely to me and to all of us, we recognize to be racist because [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=212.44s)]
*  when you look at the majority, the vast majority of the people that are being docs and harassed, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=217.32s)]
*  I mean, like almost all the people on the truck were either black, Muslim, Arab students, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=221.28s)]
*  Palestinian. And I mean, it's just disproportionately that we are targeted for this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=225.92s)]
*  And it's really shameful. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  But we recognize these to be kind of attacks out of desperation that they just have gotten [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=232.04s)]
*  so desperate that they know that our views at this point are so popular. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we've seen millions of people worldwide, 300,000 in D.C. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=242.24s)]
*  just this weekend alone in support and defending our views and defending our right to free [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  speech. And out of desperation, they've had to kind of resort to these gross scare and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=251.68s)]
*  intimidation tactics. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=257.08s)]
*  And that's kind of what we see that as. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  Kojo, here let me put the tweet by Bill Ackman on the screen that we've been discussing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=261.52s)]
*  This he posted several of them, actually. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=267.24s)]
*  This one was from October 10th, where he said, I've been asked by a number of CEOs and Bill [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=269.24s)]
*  Ackman, by the way, is a billionaire hedge fund manager. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=274.24s)]
*  He obviously has a lot of very rich and influential friends. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=277.0s)]
*  He said, I've been asked by a number of CEOs of Harvard would release a list of the names or [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=280.08s)]
*  members of each of the Harvard organizations that have issued the letter assigning sole [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  responsibility for Hamas's Hamas's heinous attacks to Israel so as to ensure that none of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  us inadvertently hire any of their members. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=294.96s)]
*  If, in fact, their members support the letter they have released, the names of the signatories [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  should be made public so their views are publicly known. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=301.84s)]
*  And then later on, he actually did get a list and published the list of all the names of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=305.12s)]
*  people who either had some affiliation with this with these organizations, whether or [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=310.0s)]
*  not they even signed the list, whether or not they supported it to basically dirty their [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  reputation and prevent them from being hired. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=317.56s)]
*  Let me ask you, obviously, you know, if you are students at Harvard, there's a presumption [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=320.6s)]
*  that you care about your futures, you care about your careers. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=324.96s)]
*  Did you find this sort of thing threatening? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=328.56s)]
*  And why is it that since these attacks were launched, you've continued to speak out in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=331.08s)]
*  defense of your views about this conflict? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=337.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=342.2s)]
*  It's a situation where, yes, the attacks were, you know, for us and saying that, you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=344.12s)]
*  know, he's going to get his CEO friends and influential people to help us and, you know, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=352.96s)]
*  put us on these blacklists like, as I've been trying to keep up with, is a scary thing to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=357.56s)]
*  face in the world. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=363.8s)]
*  But we're not we're not going to be quiet and stand the attacks. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  And then the attacks like this happen because we understand that we're in a liberation effort [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=372.0s)]
*  and that's what's at stake. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  And so all these may have very real consequences, but we're not worried. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=380.84s)]
*  I mean, I'm not worried about neither of them are. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=389.76s)]
*  Neither are the organizers that we've been doing all this with, because we understand [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=392.92s)]
*  that this is a just struggle. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=397.88s)]
*  People get demeaned when you fight for people's rights. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=400.64s)]
*  We see this all across history. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=404.04s)]
*  And this is just another sort of instance of that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  What they want us to do is capitulate. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  They want us to be scared. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=413.76s)]
*  They want us to be quiet. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=415.2s)]
*  They want us to stop holding protests, organizing protests, going to protests, speaking [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  out protests. And we're not going to give it to them, even when it means that, you know, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=420.8s)]
*  if they're going to attack our careers. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=426.56s)]
*  But at the same time, like we have like the people are behind us. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  Like I'm already said, 300,000 people in Washington, D.C., like a crazy number of people. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=433.6s)]
*  We see internationally people coming out from the UK to South Africa to Brazil. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=439.32s)]
*  All these places. A lot of people are coming out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=444.16s)]
*  So the people of the world are behind us. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=448.12s)]
*  And in terms of career, yeah, I guess we're at Harvard. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=450.36s)]
*  There's a lot of people who have careers, instincts, I would call it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  But I'm not it's not personally something that worries me because, again, this is why I pour [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=460.96s)]
*  all my energy into this. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=467.52s)]
*  What we pour all our energy and effort into. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=469.56s)]
*  And so something like that is never going to be a reason for me to stop to stop speaking out [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=471.8s)]
*  against against injustice. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=476.64s)]
*  Let me let me just ask you about something you said just now. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=478.91999999999996s)]
*  You said the reason you're continuing is because you believe your cause is just. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  A lot of people have tried to describe your cause to characterize your cause based on this [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  letter that you signed based on statements you've made subsequent to that letter as your [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  cause being pro-Hamas or pro-terrorism or supporting the idea that Jews in Israel and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=495.64000000000004s)]
*  elsewhere deserve to be killed. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=501.56s)]
*  Is that a fair characterization of how you see the cause you're supporting? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=504.68s)]
*  And if not, what is the cause that you're supporting? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=508.32s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=510.8s)]
*  Well, we have to understand that this history goes back to 75 years ago. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=514.6s)]
*  This is an occupation of a people. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=519.96s)]
*  And this is the oppression of a people. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  This is a situation where you have two codes in a land where we have apartheid, we have [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  genocide, where 10,000 people have died in Palestine since October 7th. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=531.4s)]
*  This is a situation where, I mean, this is a situation where, you know, you have things [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=537.0s)]
*  like the Napa. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=545.2s)]
*  I mean, this is a this is genocide, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=546.36s)]
*  So what against is genocide is an occupation of a people. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=550.56s)]
*  In this, you know, you have injustices similar to this. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=556.08s)]
*  I mean, in our own history as as black people in America, with stuff like Jim Crow, when [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=559.92s)]
*  you think about apartheid South Africa, they're always going to. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=565.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're always going to try. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=569.88s)]
*  But we understand that this is this is a this is a just struggle. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=571.24s)]
*  Amari, you know, I know from experience that if you speak out on this issue in any way [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=576.08s)]
*  that is off key from the bipartisan consensus in Washington, from the overwhelming [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  majority viewpoint of people in power, which is very, very pro-Israel that has been US [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=585.76s)]
*  policy under both parties for decades, you're automatically going to get accused of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=589.76s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=593.76s)]
*  That's true of me, even though I'm Jewish, even though I grew up in a Jewish tradition [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=594.9599999999999s)]
*  in a Jewish family, steep in all of the kind of aspects of Judaism. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=599.52s)]
*  And yet, when people accuse me of that anti-Semitism, one of the things they argue [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=605.28s)]
*  is, well, you seem very focused on this conflict when there are a lot of other [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=609.4799999999999s)]
*  conflicts around the world. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=613.0s)]
*  And my argument for why that is, is because it's my government that funds Israel, that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=614.5999999999999s)]
*  enables Israel to maintain the occupation, to maintain the blockade of Gaza with huge [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  amounts of money. But also it's done in many ways in my name as someone who is [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=622.48s)]
*  Jewish. And that's the reason for my focus on this conflict. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=627.76s)]
*  Given how many conflicts and how much injustice there is all over the globe, how [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=631.04s)]
*  many wars there are even now in places like Asia and Africa, how much injustice there [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=635.84s)]
*  is still in the United States. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=640.48s)]
*  What is your answer for why this cause has become so important to you? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=641.96s)]
*  Right. It's a great question. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=647.48s)]
*  And I think for me, it's not that any one struggle or any one liberation effort in the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=648.96s)]
*  world is more important than any other. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=654.2800000000001s)]
*  There's more attention than any other. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=656.2s)]
*  But we understand that the Palestinian struggle is intimately and inextricably linked to [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=658.08s)]
*  every other struggle for justice all over the world. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=661.8000000000001s)]
*  For me personally, there's been a long, robust history of solidarity between Palestinian [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  liberation movements and Black liberation struggles, both in the United States and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=670.36s)]
*  locally. You know, during South African apartheid, there is a huge solidarity between [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=674.72s)]
*  Palestine and South Africa because, I mean, they're facing occupation and apartheid in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=681.0s)]
*  the same way. Even in the United States, we saw Black freedom fighters like Malcolm X [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=685.6s)]
*  and Huey P. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=690.76s)]
*  Newton that were always vocal in their unequivocal support for the Palestinian people and [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=691.24s)]
*  the intimate connection between those histories and between those struggles. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=696.24s)]
*  And I mean, in the United States, for me, to your point, I think it's a great one that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=701.6s)]
*  it is largely our government. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=706.64s)]
*  I mean, the United States is a sponsor of Israel. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=708.16s)]
*  Israel would not be able to do or commit all the atrocities it does without the support, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=710.1999999999999s)]
*  material support from the United States. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=714.6s)]
*  I mean, it's four billion dollars every single year that the United States provides to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=716.76s)]
*  Israel and then even more in moments like these. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  And like you said, I mean, these are our tax dollars, the American tax dollars. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=724.76s)]
*  You know, I work hard. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=728.36s)]
*  I make money and then that money is sent to fund genocide in Israel because I live in [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=731.08s)]
*  America and America funds genocide overseas and sponsors Israeli government. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=736.1600000000001s)]
*  So I think everyone in America should care about this issue, especially considering the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=741.2800000000001s)]
*  fact that Americans, I mean, for many Americans, the quality of life in this country is [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=744.4000000000001s)]
*  going down. I mean, housing, the housing crisis is only getting worse. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=748.76s)]
*  Food insecurity, education, student loans, homelessness, all of these issues are [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=752.84s)]
*  skyrocketing in America. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=758.32s)]
*  And meanwhile, and we're told by our government that there's just not enough money to [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=760.24s)]
*  tend to these issues. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=764.48s)]
*  However, as soon as it's time for Israel and Israel needs more money to commit genocide [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=765.96s)]
*  and apartheid overseas, there's plenty of money in the budget. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=769.6400000000001s)]
*  And both parties agree to it's like it's a nonpartisan. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=774.24s)]
*  It's both parties that are agreeing to fund genocide overseas. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  Right. So for me, it's it's that it's the fact that, you know, my government, the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=782.12s)]
*  country in which I live is using our tax dollars to fund this. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=787.44s)]
*  And thus, it's our responsibility to apply that pressure to get them to stop doing [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=790.72s)]
*  that. But also, it's just an understanding that the Palestinian struggle is every [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=795.32s)]
*  single other liberation struggle in the world and that none of us can truly be free [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  until Palestine is free. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=801.8800000000001s)]
*  I think let me just fall a little bit in a question similar to the one that Kojo is, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=803.84s)]
*  I think one of the reasons why there was such a strong reaction to that original [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=808.12s)]
*  statement that was issued was because people were watching these videos, many of [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=811.36s)]
*  which Hamas produced and published of, you know, obvious atrocities, horrific [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=815.48s)]
*  scenes of Israeli civilians being murdered, of having their children abducted in [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=820.12s)]
*  front of them, of things that were done at the music festival that at least [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=824.72s)]
*  resulted in the deaths of lots of innocent people. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=829.36s)]
*  And people were horrified at what Hamas did. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=832.4s)]
*  Even people who believe Israel is largely at fault in the conflict felt like what [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=834.76s)]
*  Hamas did in targeting innocent civilians in Israel was unjustifiable, regardless [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=839.28s)]
*  of the context. And the letter that was issued that you each participated in said [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=843.84s)]
*  the following, we the under-signed student organizations hold the Israeli regime [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=850.36s)]
*  entirely responsible for all unfolding violence. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  The apartheid regime is the only one to blame. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=857.2s)]
*  Israeli violence has structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=859.6800000000001s)]
*  years. I think a lot of people read that and said they seem to have either no [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=864.08s)]
*  empathy for the lives of innocent Israelis that were extinguished on that day or even [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=871.5999999999999s)]
*  seem to be kind of justifying what Hamas did in Israel. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=878.0s)]
*  Are either of those things a fair reaction to the letter that you issued? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=882.04s)]
*  Yeah, so I will say that obviously no one likes a taste of blood, you know, and I [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  think the loss of life, especially innocent life, is always lamentable. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=893.0s)]
*  It's always sad. You know, no one no one wants war. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=897.04s)]
*  No one wants violence. Nobody wants these things. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=899.68s)]
*  We want to live in a country with peace where, you know, bloodshed is not we don't [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=902.12s)]
*  see bloodshed to the scale. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=908.04s)]
*  But it's important to understand in this context that the root cause of the violence [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  does come back and go back 75 years ago, beginning with the Nakba in 1948, where 700,000 [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=913.88s)]
*  Palestinians were brutally and forcibly removed from the land that has historically [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=920.1999999999999s)]
*  always been there, that they've lived in for generations, right? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=924.76s)]
*  That they've tended to and lived in this land for generations and they were forcibly [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=928.08s)]
*  removed from it violently. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=932.44s)]
*  And ever since then, you know, I mean, obviously many Palestinians still remain in this [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=936.0s)]
*  land and now today they're treated like worse than second class citizens and then [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=940.4s)]
*  they're bombed periodically. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  And now we're seeing a literal genocide in Gaza and then even more so, there's still, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=946.6s)]
*  you know, continually brutal repression of Palestinians all throughout this court, all [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=951.4s)]
*  throughout occupied Palestine, not just in Gaza that we're seeing the news right now. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=957.36s)]
*  And it's important to understand that, I mean, these when someone is, you know, facing [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=961.64s)]
*  such brutal repression, we see always throughout history that there's always a [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=968.64s)]
*  response to that. Eventually, people are going to be like, we're not going to take [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=972.12s)]
*  this anymore. And, you know, like I said, bloodshed and violence is always, I mean, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=974.36s)]
*  no one likes it. I don't think that I don't, you know, it's always. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  No one likes the taste of blood, I'll say. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=985.08s)]
*  But that being said, to truly stop the violence, to truly end all the violence in the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=988.08s)]
*  region, which is truly what I want more than anything, we have to understand the root [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=992.0400000000001s)]
*  cause of that violence. And we have to go back to before October 7th and realize that [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=996.12s)]
*  all of this, there's a deep history that goes back 75 years and none of the violence will [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  stop until we address that adequately. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHkWSYWTDw&t=1004.48s)]
