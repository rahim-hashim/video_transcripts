# Mask-Off: Pelosi Accuses Anti-Israel Protesters of Kremlin Ties
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0)
*  All right, Nancy Pelosi made an appearance on CNN on Sunday yesterday with Dana Bash, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=0.0s)]
*  and just three days earlier, Nancy Pelosi was at a fundraising event in California that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  was disrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters demanding of her from her an answer as to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=21.8s)]
*  why she supports the war in Gaza, which she does. Nancy Pelosi is one of the most steadfast and most [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=27.7s)]
*  loyal supporters of Israel. She has been her whole career, and Nancy Pelosi obviously does not like [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=35.14s)]
*  when her swanky fundraising events are disrupted by dirty protesters who are criticizing her, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  and as a result she went on CNN and had a lot to say about people in the United States who are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=48.78s)]
*  exercising their constitutional rights to protest not just the war in Israel but the role that the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=54.3s)]
*  United States is playing in enabling that war, and here's what she had to say about these people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=61.22s)]
*  They're in front of my house all the time, so I have a feeling for what feelings they have, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=65.42s)]
*  but we have to think about what we're doing, and what we have to do is try to stop the... [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=72.94s)]
*  Okay, I just want to say that there is hard, it's hard to imagine any sentiment more insincere [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=77.5s)]
*  than what she started off by saying. Look at the anger in her face when she says, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=83.94s)]
*  these people are in front of my house all the time, and she went on to so insincerely claim [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  that that's why she has empathy for their views because she hears it all the time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=94.3s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi wants those people dead. Anyone who protests Nancy Pelosi, you can see the rage and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=97.38s)]
*  the just notion of being offended that anybody would protest her in this way, especially people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=104.94s)]
*  in her own party, but that's what's been happening. You can see when she sets up the foundation for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  what she's about to say, what's really going on in her head, in her brain, is that she's filled with [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=120.38s)]
*  rage at these people. I have a feeling for what feelings they have, but we have to think about [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=125.18s)]
*  what we're doing, and what we have to do is try to stop the suffering in Gaza. This is women and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=134.62s)]
*  children, people who don't have a place to go, so let's address that. But for them to call for a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=141.62s)]
*  ceasefire is Mr. Putin's message. Mr. Putin's message. Make no mistake, this is directly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  connected to what he would like to see. Same thing with Ukraine. It's about... [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=154.94s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi sees a war in the Middle East that has created a deeply polarized reaction around the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=160.5s)]
*  world. There are millions of people in every country on this planet who are looking at what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=170.1s)]
*  the Israelis are doing in Gaza and reacting with all kinds of outrage and anger and indignation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=177.38s)]
*  Now obviously there are a lot of people in many of these countries that support what Israel is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=183.66s)]
*  doing as well, but it is a debate that is taking place throughout the world. And Nancy Pelosi sees [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=187.26s)]
*  this Middle East conflict and can only see it through the prism of what Vladimir Putin wants. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  This is a pathology that the Democratic Party has cultivated, not just among its followers, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=200.54s)]
*  but also among its leaders. It is a really deranged conspiracy theory to believe that these [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=207.54s)]
*  protesters who are every day marching against American leaders who are supporting and funding [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=214.78s)]
*  Israel's war in Gaza are somehow doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin and that somehow they're serving [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=220.34s)]
*  Putin's interests by asking for a ceasefire because that's what Putin would want and she thinks that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=229.1s)]
*  that's the right prism for understanding these protesters is that they must have some allegiance [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=235.66s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin because their view happens to align with what she claims is his view about the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=240.38s)]
*  Middle East war. That kind of leap, the logical stretching that requires is just demented, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  but it has become completely normalized in Democratic Party discourse. This is what they've [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=253.5s)]
*  been saying for eight years about basically everything. Anybody who criticizes Democrats [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=257.86s)]
*  automatically is either a Russian agent or unwittingly doing the bidding of Putin. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=263.26s)]
*  And you can see how insane it is when it's stripped out of any context that's actually [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=268.38s)]
*  directly related to Putin. I mean even people obviously who oppose US funding of the war in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=274.94s)]
*  Ukraine got accused of this all the time as though nobody could question why the US government should [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=281.34s)]
*  be involved in this war unless they were doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin. At least there, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=286.78s)]
*  there was an actual proximity of that war to the Russians. To decide you're going to look at the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=290.26s)]
*  Middle East conflict through this prism of what Vladimir Putin wants, just because this is what [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=295.62s)]
*  you've talked yourself into for eight years shows how extreme this framework has become. It's really [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=301.82s)]
*  quite demented, but she didn't just stop there. She had a lot more to say about these protesters. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=309.02s)]
*  About Putin's message. I think some of these protesters are spontaneous and organic and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=313.02s)]
*  sincere. Some I think are connected to Russia. And I say that having looked at this for a long [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=320.18s)]
*  time now. You think some of these protests are Russian plants? I don't think they're plants. I think [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=328.18s)]
*  some financing should be investigated. And I want to ask the FBI to investigate that. I mean that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=333.02s)]
*  is an extraordinary statement. Just to kind of throw on at the end, I want the FBI to go and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=341.34000000000003s)]
*  investigate these people who are protesting American leaders for their support for a war in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=346.26s)]
*  Israel that has provoked indignation throughout the world. Just the mere belief that she has the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=350.98s)]
*  right to call on the FBI to investigate people exercising their constitutional rights to protest [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=358.14s)]
*  the government's war policy based on some completely concocted connection she's invented [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=363.3s)]
*  between these people that she hates because they're protesting her and the Kremlin is as [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=370.26s)]
*  authoritarian of a claim as can be imagined. The fact that though it is invented out of whole cloth [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=377.06s)]
*  is something that even the New York Times that generally reports very favorably on Nancy Pelosi, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=386.34s)]
*  obviously itself that was quite indefensible. Here they had to do a report even though Nancy [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=392.7s)]
*  Pelosi is not the House Speaker because it's a pretty amazing event to hear an American politician, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=400.94s)]
*  still a member of Congress with a lot of influence, make a claim of the sort and to call for the FBI to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  investigate political protesters. So here's the New York Times said while reporting it, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=411.74s)]
*  Pelosi wants the FBI to investigate pro-Palestinian protesters. The former House [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=416.94s)]
*  Speaker suggested without offering evidence that some protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=421.74s)]
*  had financial ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin. Now normally this phrase here suggested without [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=427.94s)]
*  evidence or without offering evidence is reserved for statements made by Donald Trump. They will [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=437.86s)]
*  often say Donald Trump today claimed with no evidence that X, Y, and Z. I don't think I've [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=445.26s)]
*  ever seen the New York Times use that phrasing for Nancy Pelosi or the pronouncements of leading [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=449.5s)]
*  Democrats but this was such an extreme case that even they felt compelled to do so. Now here is [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi today who returned to this topic but had a much different claim to make. She was [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  confronting the pro-Palestinian protesters who were outside of her house, the ones that she [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=474.82s)]
*  mentioned on CNN and this time for some reason she decided to accuse them of being controlled [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=479.09999999999997s)]
*  and financed by China and not by Russia. Watch her screaming at them as her security guard or [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=485.46s)]
*  aid guides her into her armored vehicle. Right now there's video up in just a second. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=491.46s)]
*  I mean these are basically like old white leftists in San Francisco who are doing this and yesterday [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=521.46s)]
*  she went on CNN accused them of being controlled by the Kremlin and then today she just decided to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=539.1s)]
*  accuse them of being controlled by Beijing. She said go back to China where your headquarters is. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=545.58s)]
*  I guess she just is going to accuse them of being controlled by a foreign country or questioning [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=550.74s)]
*  their loyalties and their patriotism no matter what and it's just kind of which country she [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=558.9000000000001s)]
*  decides to accuse them of being loyal to changes day by day. Now just to underscore how central [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=564.94s)]
*  this belief is in Democratic Party politics that everyone is connected to Russians, everyone's [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=573.98s)]
*  controlled by Russians. The New York Times reporter Ken Vogel noted today that Adam Schiff sent out a [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=579.98s)]
*  fundraising letter and as Vogel put it the fundraising letter says quote he proved that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=587.26s)]
*  Trump's campaign colluded with Russia. Now and by the way this whole this email begins by saying [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=595.34s)]
*  I've been called shifty Schiff, pencil neck, a scum socialist and a whole lot worse and then he [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=603.5s)]
*  was referring to how the Republican Senate candidate Steve Garvey had called Adam Schiff a liar for [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=611.18s)]
*  saying that he had smoking gun evidence that the Russians and Trump colluded to interfere in the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=617.74s)]
*  2016 election and he then goes on to say that actually during his time as chairman of the House [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=622.78s)]
*  Intelligence Committee he was able to prove exactly that connection even though the special [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=628.46s)]
*  counsel that he references here Robert Mueller closed his investigation after 18 months without [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=636.62s)]
*  ever charging anyone with that core conspiracy criminal collusion or conspiracy with the Russian [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=642.5400000000001s)]
*  government to interfere in the 2016 election. They charged people for alleged crimes during the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=648.94s)]
*  investigation. They convicted Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort on various unrelated tax [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=654.54s)]
*  issues and financial issues involving his lobbying efforts but on the core question [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=662.78s)]
*  of whether the Trump campaign criminally colluded with the Russians not only did Adam Schiff charge [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=669.18s)]
*  zero Americans with that crime but he also explicitly stated in his report when he submitted his [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=674.78s)]
*  report at the close of the investigation we could not find evidence that established this conspiracy [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=681.74s)]
*  that was the framing the words that he used and yet in Democratic Party politics in the mind of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=687.98s)]
*  Adam Schiff the Trump Russia collusion conspiracy theory wasn't debunked it was actually something [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=693.5s)]
*  that was proven to the point where Adam Schiff can boast about how he was the one who actually [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=702.62s)]
*  proved it. Now again this is what Democrats have been doing for years you wind them up and they [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=708.78s)]
*  accuse people whoever they're trying to defeat whoever they're trying to undermine of being [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=714.54s)]
*  financed and controlled by the Russians. Here's the Washington Post from February 2020 this was [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=719.5s)]
*  the day after Bernie Sanders had won first Iowa then New Hampshire and then had a massive victory [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=726.14s)]
*  in Nevada where he looked like he was on the way to the nomination and the Washington Post published [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=731.66s)]
*  this report quote Bernie Sanders briefed by US officials that Russia is trying to help his [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=736.54s)]
*  presidential campaign. Here from the Washington Post I just clicked the wrong button in July of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=741.5799999999999s)]
*  2020 so right as the Black Lives Matter protests were unfolding in the United States they reported [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=752.54s)]
*  the following quote Russia's disinformation campaigns are targeting African Americans [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=758.9399999999999s)]
*  Russia is making its involvement by outsourcing its disinformation [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5QhMH9s8G0&t=763.42s)]
