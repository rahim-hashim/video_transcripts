# What Happened to Gaza in Liberal Discourse?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I)
*  I just want to while we're on the subject of liberal discourse and Biden, ask the question [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=0.0s)]
*  if anyone knows what happened to all of the liberal talk about Gaza and how there was [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=11.14s)]
*  a genocide there and how Joe Biden was leading the genocide and enabling genocide. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=17.82s)]
*  Now, as I've said before, I can, I guess, understand how someone might say, I think [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=25.98s)]
*  Joe Biden is guilty of genocide, but I'm still going to vote for him because I guess maybe [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=30.5s)]
*  the reason that he's like the lesser of two genocide illegals or something. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=37.74s)]
*  I personally don't understand how you can actually accuse somebody of enabling a genocide [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=42.84s)]
*  and then decide that you people have to vote for them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=49.38s)]
*  Seems very contradictory to me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=52.1s)]
*  I mean, I get that you end up voting for people in a democracy who you think have flaws, who [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=53.38s)]
*  are less than perfect or whatever, but like there have to be some line like actually accusing [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  somebody of being genocidal, probably the worst crime against humanity that can be committed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=63.14s)]
*  Seems to me like that should be over a line. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  But at the very least, I guess how someone might distort their brain so much that it [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=70.58s)]
*  makes sense to say, I think Joe Biden is guilty of genocide and I'm going to vote for him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=74.66s)]
*  But to say, I think Joe Biden is guilty of genocide and then he preys on him at the same [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=80.34s)]
*  time, that makes no sense to me except that it means that the people who were accusing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=84.86s)]
*  Joe Biden of genocide never really meant it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=91.62s)]
*  We're just posturing for their own brand or whatever. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=95.06s)]
*  Here is Rachel Maddow, probably the most influential TV liberal, who went on TV last night right [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=99.1s)]
*  after Joe Biden gave his press conference at NATO where he spoke for about 50 minutes [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=104.62s)]
*  without a script on various foreign policy topics. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=108.98s)]
*  And here's what Rachel Maddow had to say about Joe Biden. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=113.30000000000001s)]
*  So and I won't I won't go on at length. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  I will just say, though, you noted that there were some moments of startlingly impressive [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=118.9s)]
*  command of the issues. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=123.9s)]
*  This is just my opinion. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=125.78s)]
*  He is not only strong on foreign policy, he is just just fundamentally right on foreign [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=127.98s)]
*  policy in the way that he talks about it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  And again, your mileage may vary. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=134.62s)]
*  That is how I feel about the way he talks about our relationship with our allies and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=136.38s)]
*  our relationship with NATO. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=140.28s)]
*  You can hear his command of the issues, particularly in his asides, like mentioning as an offhand [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=141.54s)]
*  way that it was Turkey really that needed really to be talked into an expansion of NATO [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=147.1s)]
*  that included Finland and Sweden, talking about the numbers of Russian troop losses [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  in Ukraine, talking about the fact that he turned in his notes after he spoke privately [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=155.18s)]
*  with President Xi, alluding to the fact that Trump had all those. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=159.7s)]
*  Now, there you see her spawn on the left, Chris Hayes, who owes his job to her. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=162.38s)]
*  And he's just like sitting there nodding madly every time Rachel Maddow offers another bit [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=168.18s)]
*  of praise for Joe Biden's foreign policy acumen, how everything he does is has always turned [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=172.42s)]
*  out to be correct and right, how she always agrees he's sitting there nodding, which is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=178.48s)]
*  one of his jobs when Rachel Maddow is on air and speaking. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=182.14s)]
*  Let's watch that fact that he turned in his notes after he spoke privately with President [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=184.38s)]
*  she alluding to the fact that Trump had all those weird meetings with the Russians and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  Putin in which he had no note taker present. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=191.98s)]
*  I mean, it's even in the little asides where it just shows you he is a master of the foreign [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=194.5s)]
*  policy field and has been for decades in his career in the Senate, the vice president and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=199.22s)]
*  the presidency. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=203.82s)]
*  I've never seen anybody like nod their head so like intensely and just like a 90 second [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=204.82s)]
*  period. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=210.34s)]
*  I actually didn't think the next is saying that I thought you'd at least like sprain [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=211.34s)]
*  it if not break the neck. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=214.74s)]
*  Maybe Chris Hayes has a particular elastic one, but it's kind of amazing because remember [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=216.88s)]
*  Joe Biden was the leading and most influential advocate in the Senate convincing Democrats [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=220.4s)]
*  and liberals to support the Bush Cheney war in Iraq. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=229.5s)]
*  He was the breaking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=232.16s)]
*  Now when I got to know Rachel Maddow when I used to go on her America show in 2006 and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=236.64s)]
*  2007 and then her MSNBC show in 2008 and nine and 10 and 11. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=241.6s)]
*  She talked about the Iraq war as this like act of grave evil, this extreme crime. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=247.88s)]
*  And now she is saying Joe Biden has such a grasp, not only a grasp of foreign policy, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  but also his judgment is unerring. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=261.06s)]
*  Everything he does in says in foreign policy realm is correct. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=263.88s)]
*  I agree with it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=267.24s)]
*  So let's go to the Iraq war, the bombing of Libya, the CIA attempt to overthrow or regime [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=269.16s)]
*  change Bashar al-Assad that destroyed that country. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=279.2s)]
*  Obviously he supports the war in the Ukraine, but also presumably the war, the decision [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=282.0s)]
*  to arm and fund and protect the Israeli war in Gaza. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=286.12s)]
*  And you see Chris Hayes sitting there nodding his head. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  Now Chris Hayes is somebody who has been feigning and purporting to be so offended by Biden's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=291.68s)]
*  support for Israel over the last eight months. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=297.68s)]
*  And not only did he sit there and nod his head madly while Rachel Maddow was saying [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=300.24s)]
*  how everything Biden does is foreign policy is so correct, but Chris Hayes himself went [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  on his own program on July 10th and he began a monologue by saying this, quote, Joe Biden [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=307.24s)]
*  is a decent man who has done nothing wrong. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=313.36s)]
*  He has not got caught in a scandal. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  He's just aging. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=319.36s)]
*  And that reality, I think, makes him increasingly likely to lose election to our Republican [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=320.56s)]
*  candidate. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, if you're somebody who actually believes that the Israelis are committing war crimes [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  in Israel, that they're engaged in genocide, and at the same time you believe Joe Biden [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=332.96s)]
*  has supported it and enabled it and paid for it, which he has, how can you then possibly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=337.4s)]
*  say at the same time that Joe Biden is a decent man? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=342.24s)]
*  We covered this last night. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=347.44s)]
*  What is meant when people say Joe Biden is such a good and decent man? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=348.44s)]
*  He has such high values, such high character. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  In the case of somebody who has spent nine months crying practically on air about how [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=354.08s)]
*  emotionally moved he is, about how angry he is by what the Israelis are doing in Gaza, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=360.2s)]
*  to then turn around and speak about the person most responsible for that, which is not Benjamin [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=364.88s)]
*  Netanyahu who couldn't do it without the help of the United States, but Joe Biden, and say [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=371.0s)]
*  he's a good and decent man, just proves how inauthentic all of that was. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=375.4s)]
*  There's no way you could have believed what he was saying for the last eight months and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  then turn around and say this about Joe Biden. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=386.4s)]
*  Now, I know we don't hear much about Gaza anymore. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=390.67999999999995s)]
*  I know we don't hear about much of what Israel is doing anymore. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  There are no more campus protests because they crushed a lot of them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  It's also college break in the summer. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=398.28s)]
*  Despite the significantly reduced attention being paid to and anger and rage about Biden's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=402.36s)]
*  support and financing of an arming of what's going on in Gaza, the destruction and suffering [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=409.52s)]
*  and carnage in Gaza has not reduced at all. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=415.24s)]
*  Here is Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs who says, quote, so much for all eyes on Rafa. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=419.6s)]
*  That's what a lot of liberals have been saying. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=429.76s)]
*  He said, quote, while the world's not paying attention, Israel has turned Rafa into a, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=432.24s)]
*  quote, flattened wasteland and an unrecognizable depopulated ghost town. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=436.64s)]
*  Now, you may recall that before Israel began invading and bombing Rafa, the official position [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=441.64s)]
*  of the Biden administration was not only that we oppose it and don't want it to happen, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=449.96s)]
*  Joe Biden proclaimed it a red line, which is president speak for, that we will not allow [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=455.0s)]
*  under any circumstance a country to do this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=461.68s)]
*  And if they do, we will act very strongly to punish them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=463.44s)]
*  And Netanyahu laughed in his face from the very minute he said that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=468.04s)]
*  And Netanyahu kept openly saying, we don't care what the administration wants. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=471.48s)]
*  We don't care what Biden says. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=474.92s)]
*  We're going into Rafa. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=475.92s)]
*  And then when they first went into Rafa, the Biden administration was trying to justify [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=476.92s)]
*  it by saying, oh, they're just like going in a little bit. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=480.68s)]
*  They're just like pinpointing and pinpricking. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=483.8s)]
*  And in reality, Rafa is, looks like every other part of Gaza now, completely and utterly [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=491.88s)]
*  And then just this week, Joe Biden announced that he was sending a huge cache of 500 pound [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=492.88s)]
*  bombs to Israel, the bombs that are used to do all of this. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=500.88s)]
*  So it's like, where did all that discourse go? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  All that rage and anger go as the election approaches? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=509.76s)]

*  And I wish I could say that was surprising, but in fact, it was totally predictable. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=516.32s)]
*  In fact, in March of 2024, I posted online a poll and I asked, when will left liberal [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=520.32s)]
*  YouTube host and streamers pivot from, quote, Joe Biden is literally enabling a genocide [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=527.88s)]
*  dude to look, I'm not a fan of Biden, but you got to get out and vote for him if you [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=534.96s)]
*  live in a sling state. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=539.72s)]
*  And I gave the options, will that happen in March? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  Will it happen in May? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=544.36s)]
*  Will that happen in July? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=545.4s)]
*  Will that happen in October? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=546.4s)]
*  Proving what? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=548.0s)]
*  Brilliant impression followers I have on Twitter. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=549.0s)]
*  The overall winner, the overwhelming winner of that poll was that will happen in July. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=553.2s)]
*  And that's exactly when it's happening. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=557.64s)]
*  Everything that was about, let's make sure Joe Biden wins or get him out to make sure [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=561.5600000000001s)]

*  this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=573.64s)]

*  against Hamas militants there. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=607.76s)]
*  The offensive was part of a wider Israeli effort to clamp down on a renewed Hamas insurgency [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=610.4399999999999s)]

*  Now, it wasn't just random people accusing Joe Biden of enabling genocide, it was the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=670.52s)]
*  most prominent left wing elected officials in the United States. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=675.0s)]
*  Here was Ilyon Omar only in May of this year, not in October, November, but just in May [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=679.88s)]
*  a couple months ago. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=685.16s)]
*  And this is what she said, quote, this is unconscionable. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=687.56s)]
*  This is a time to use all of our leverage and restrict military aid, not fuel the flames [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  of an already catastrophic genocide. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=696.52s)]
*  President Biden must change course. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  So she was accusing Biden just two months ago of enabling and protecting a genocide, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=703.5999999999999s)]
*  perpetrating a genocide. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=709.04s)]
*  And the tweet that she was responding to said this, quote, the Biden administration is moving [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  forward with more than a billion dollars in new weapons deals for Israel just days after [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=715.3199999999999s)]
*  the White House said it paused a shipment of bombs. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=720.4799999999999s)]
*  Here's Rashida Tlaib, the Democrat from Michigan, who said this in July, quote, it's sick how [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=725.56s)]
*  the government of Israel intentionally targets Palestinians over and over again while world [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=733.3199999999999s)]
*  leaders say and watch and say absolutely nothing. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=738.8s)]
*  Some of it, some of it, some even funded proudly, obviously meaning Biden. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=741.68s)]
*  This is genocide targeting civilians like this is a war crime. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  ICC, where are the arrest warrants? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=750.3599999999999s)]
*  And just this week, there was a video of Palestinians who are playing soccer and a bunch of other [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=754.92s)]
*  Palestinians watching. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=760.3399999999999s)]
*  You can imagine there's not a lot to do. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=761.3399999999999s)]
*  So they use this space at what was a school and is now a shelter to play soccer and watch [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=764.1600000000001s)]
*  people playing soccer as well. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=771.76s)]
*  And there was a huge Israeli airstrike right there. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  And you can watch it all happening as a result of video obtained by Al Jazeera. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=776.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=794.96s)]
*  oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=815.68s)]
*  I get the idea that was in communists. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  There were dozens of people reported killed. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=831.16s)]
*  It's hard to overstate what the people of Gaza have gone through. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=836.12s)]
*  This is now a war in its 10th month of unprecedented civilian infrastructure destruction using [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=839.72s)]
*  massive bombs and extremely densely packed areas filled primarily with children and women. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=847.24s)]
*  That's all still happening just because so few, even though so few people are talking [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=854.28s)]
*  about it in the hope to get the Democratic Party responsible for this re-elected. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=857.28s)]
*  Here's a tweet that Rashida Tlaib just retweeted yesterday. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=862.24s)]
*  This is from the IMU policy project. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=867.64s)]
*  It says, quote, a New York Times investigation has confirmed that a bomb made in the US by [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=870.88s)]
*  Boeing was used in this Israeli airstrike that killed Palestinian children playing soccer [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=875.56s)]
*  at a school in Gaza. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=881.64s)]
*  This is what President Biden and Congress are doing with our tax dollars. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=883.38s)]
*  So the bomb that we just showed you actually, as usual, was an American bomb made by Boeing, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=886.64s)]
*  sent by the Biden administration to the Israelis to bomb Gaza. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=892.68s)]
*  And so you have here major Democratic leaders who are continuously calling this a genocide. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=897.48s)]
*  And yet, other than Rashida Tlaib, who whatever you think of her is at least following that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=903.96s)]
*  claim to its own conclusion because she seems like she really believes in it, you can't [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=911.08s)]
*  really find Rashida Tlaib talking much about helping Joe Biden or the Democrats win. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=915.24s)]
*  She was encouraging people in Michigan in the primary to vote uncommitted or against [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=922.0s)]
*  Biden to send that message. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=925.72s)]
*  But most of the people who have been echoing what they've been saying, calling this a genocide [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=927.72s)]
*  and the like, have totally abandoned that in favor of, oh, let's elect a Democratic [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  party, just as was so predictable that they would do. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  They got a lot of benefit from posturing as radicals. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=939.9599999999999s)]
*  They threw around the word genocide. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=942.28s)]
*  Seemed like they cared so much. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=944.28s)]
*  And then exactly as my poll, for the people who responded to my poll predicted in July, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=947.84s)]
*  those people would start stop pretending that they cared and start focusing only on how [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=952.24s)]
*  to keep the Democratic party responsible for this quote genocide in power. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=957.12s)]
*  Just to tell you about one completely preposterous component of all this, as you probably remember, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=962.48s)]
*  Joe Biden announced that they were going to construct a pier off the coast of Gaza in [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=970.08s)]
*  order to get humanitarian aid into Gaza because the Israelis barred them, barred the United [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=975.5600000000001s)]
*  States from getting that aid in by land. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=981.36s)]
*  So first, the United States tried parachuting it in, complete humiliation. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  We're paying for this war. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=989.44s)]
*  And the Israelis said, you're not going to allow humanitarian aid in. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=990.4s)]
*  So we had to first try and drop it by parachute. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=992.4s)]
*  And then we built a pier that Biden administration did. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=994.96s)]
*  Multiple times since that pier has been built just a few months ago, whenever there was bad [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1001.76s)]
*  weather, it began breaking into little pieces and floating away. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1005.36s)]
*  It was completely dysfunctional. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1009.44s)]
*  And now the Biden administration announces just a few months later, quote, Pentagon to [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1010.8s)]
*  dismantle the temporary pier built for Gaza aid operation, quote, the $230 million short [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  notice project has struggled to overcome rough seas and other problems since it started in [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1020.9599999999999s)]
*  May. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1026.1599999999999s)]
*  In a statement, Major General Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon's press secretary, said the latest [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1027.2s)]
*  effort to re-anchor the pier failed because of, quote, technical and weather-related issues, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  recurring problems that the New York Times identified last month when it reported that [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1036.96s)]
*  military officials had warned aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1040.72s)]
*  as July. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1044.72s)]
*  Mr. Biden ordered the U.S. military to begin building the pier in March at a time when he [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1046.4s)]
*  was being sharply criticized for not doing what would rein in Israel's military response. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1050.56s)]
*  At the time, health authorities were warning that Gaza was on the precipice of famine. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1055.2s)]
*  Mr. Sullivan explained that the pier was not necessary as necessary as it once was because [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1060.08s)]
*  more land crossings to ship and into Gaza had opened in recent weeks under pressure from the [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1064.56s)]
*  White House. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1069.12s)]
*  Quote, the real issue right now is not about getting aid into Gaza. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1069.6799999999998s)]
*  It's about getting aid around Gaza effectively. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1073.6799999999998s)]
*  But there are a lot of things that we need to work through, including lawlessness and [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1076.08s)]
*  armed gangs. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1079.12s)]
*  In some cases, Hamas itself is trying to disrupt and derail the delivery. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1079.76s)]
*  Still, humanitarian groups have complained that the pier has largely failed in its mission. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1083.9199999999998s)]
*  And nearly two months since it was first attached to the shoreline, the pier has been in [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1089.04s)]
*  service only about 20 days. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1092.88s)]
*  The rest of the time it was being repaired after Rep. C's broke it apart, detached to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1096.3200000000002s)]
*  avoid further damage or cause or pause because of security concerns. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1100.64s)]
*  Can you believe the Biden administration built a pier that cost $230 million that didn't even [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1109.0400000000002s)]
*  work? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1115.1200000000001s)]
*  It was supposed to be a pier in the ocean. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1115.68s)]
*  Obviously, it was predictable it was going to rain, but when it rained, it broke into [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  little pieces and now they're dismantling it entirely. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1120.64s)]
*  One of the things I've seen certain liberal pundits and Democrats and the like doing is [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1126.4s)]
*  saying, look, we can accept Kamala Harris, but not Joe Biden because unlike Joe Biden, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1133.2s)]
*  somehow Kamala Harris has no responsibility for or connection to support for the Israeli [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1138.96s)]
*  war in Gaza. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1144.4s)]
*  Are you really going to try and convince yourselves of that? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1147.76s)]
*  You're comfortable supporting Kamala Harris even though you've been calling this genocide [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1151.0400000000002s)]
*  because somehow it's only Biden but not Kamala Harris supporting this war in Gaza? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1154.5600000000002s)]
*  Do you really think Kamala Harris is more anti-Israel than Joe Biden? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1160.8000000000002s)]
*  Have you ever watched her speeches given to AIPAC? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  Or just I'll show you a little snippet of an interview Kamala Harris did with Katie [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1170.24s)]
*  Couric in January of this year where Katie Couric, to her credit, had to force Kamala [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1174.56s)]
*  Harris to answer one question that she refused to answer repeatedly, which is, are you in [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1181.6s)]
*  favor of imposing conditions on the transfer of Israeli weapons and Israeli money, of American [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1186.8s)]
*  weapons and Israeli money to Israel and listen to what Kamala Harris said? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1194.08s)]
*  Let's do more to protect innocent civilians. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1197.9199999999998s)]
*  We've been very clear humanitarian aid must flow. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1201.6s)]
*  From day one, I will tell you one of my areas of priority included. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1204.8799999999999s)]
*  Let's think about the day after because we must stay focused on an eventual two-state [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1209.52s)]
*  solution. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1214.48s)]
*  Well, having said that, I want to tell you something which I'm sure you're well aware [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1215.1999999999998s)]
*  of that Bibi Netanyahu, Prime Minister Netanyahu recently said. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1218.9599999999998s)]
*  He rejected U.S. calls to scale back Israel's military action in the Gaza Strip or to support [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  a Palestinian state after the war. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1231.12s)]
*  He even said that Israel, quote, must have security control over the entire territory [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  west of the Jordan River, which includes Gaza. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1240.7199999999998s)]
*  So given those positions, how can you possibly come together? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1243.36s)]
*  How can the U.S. and Israel come together to solve this? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  And should aid to Israel be conditional? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1253.1999999999998s)]
*  So I'll start with the principles that we are applying to this discussion, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  which we've been very clear with the Israeli government about. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  One, as it relates to the day after, there should be no reoccupation of Gaza. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1265.12s)]
*  There should be no changing of the territorial boundaries of Gaza. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1270.08s)]
*  That the Palestinians are entitled to an equal measure with Israelis, security, and prosperity. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  Doesn't sound like Bibi Netanyahu agrees with that. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1285.2s)]
*  We're the United States of America. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1288.24s)]
*  I'm telling you our position. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1289.68s)]
*  And we take our role in this discussion very seriously. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1292.24s)]
*  There may be disagreements. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1295.84s)]
*  That doesn't mean we're going to change our mind about the principles that are important [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1297.04s)]
*  to be applied to this process in terms of what a day after should look like. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1302.16s)]
*  And those principles remain consistent. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1310.4s)]
*  We believe very strongly. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1313.36s)]
*  I believe very strongly. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1315.2s)]
*  Palestinians are entitled to dignity and self-determination. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1316.72s)]
*  We believe there must be a two-state solution for the sake of the stability in the region. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1322.32s)]
*  We believe very strongly as a first principle Israel must be secure. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1328.16s)]
*  That Hamas must not be in a position to commit terrorist acts [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1332.88s)]
*  against innocent people or the people of Israel in particular. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1339.1200000000001s)]
*  So should aid, Madam Vice President, be conditional? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1343.04s)]
*  If the Prime Minister of Israel is stating this, should that aid not come if there's [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  not that kind of flexibility that you're seeking? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1355.28s)]
*  We are right now in a position of negotiating with Congress to follow through on a commitment [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1359.2s)]
*  we made for aid. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1365.3600000000001s)]
*  And we are taking it one day at a time in terms of what is happening in the region [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1366.88s)]
*  and how we are addressing the issue. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1370.88s)]
*  But that's where we are right now. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1372.56s)]
*  So I don't feel like you really answered my question. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1374.56s)]
*  I think I did. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1377.2s)]
*  But do you think it should be conditional? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1379.12s)]
*  I know you're carrying out what— [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1380.8s)]
*  That's not our position right now. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1381.9199999999998s)]
*  Not right now? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1383.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1384.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1384.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1387.76s)]
*  So for those of you who were saying that the Biden administration is guilty of genocide, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1388.1599999999999s)]
*  and I've seen you saying, look, we can live with Kamala Harris because she's not as responsible [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1393.28s)]
*  for the war in Gaza. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1397.84s)]
*  There she is. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1399.52s)]
*  What else do you need from her? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1401.2s)]
*  She's saying it's not our position to tell the Israelis that we're going to condition aid [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1402.08s)]
*  if they don't actually carry out the things that we want them to do. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1411.4399999999998s)]
*  That if they don't agree to these kinds of humanitarian demands that they don't get more [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1417.1999999999998s)]
*  humanitarian aid in, she was asked, are you going to limit Israeli weapons? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1423.6799999999998s)]
*  And she didn't know. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  That's not our position now. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1428.8s)]
*  So what is the difference, someone tell me, if you want to try and make this argument [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1430.24s)]
*  between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden when it comes to the Israeli, the United States arming [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1433.28s)]
*  and funding and diplomatically protecting without conditions everything Israel has done in Gaza? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1440.24s)]
*  Now, just want to show you one last—two last issues quickly. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  One is we've been doing a lot of reporting on how the Israelis have been pressuring Big Tech [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  to censor debate about the war in Israel online, not in Israel, but in the West for Americans. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1456.96s)]
*  Today there was a story about how the EU has taken another step forward to try and prosecute [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1466.64s)]
*  Twitter acts for not censoring enough under EU law. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1474.16s)]
*  And right after the October 7th attack, one of the things that the EU did when it announced [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1478.96s)]
*  this process against acts is they wanted to deliberately get more conservative and [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1483.76s)]
*  centrist support for the EU censorship scheme. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1488.96s)]
*  They accused acts of failing to censor enough anti-Israel content. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1491.52s)]
*  And that, of course, is the reason that with we've shown you many times, TikTok was finally banned [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1498.8799999999999s)]
*  because people became convinced that there was too much Israel criticism allowed to circulate [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1503.6s)]
*  on TikTok. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1508.08s)]
*  And that was why so many young Americans were against the war in Gaza. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1508.64s)]
*  So all that censorship has been going on for a long time. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1512.88s)]
*  The Israelis have been meeting with Big Tech. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1516.24s)]
*  They've been trying to circulate studies showing that Big Tech is not censoring enough [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1518.0800000000002s)]
*  anti-Israel content. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1522.64s)]
*  And it's been paying off. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1523.8400000000001s)]
*  And today from NBC News, it's paid off again. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1524.88s)]
*  Metta, which owns Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, the parent company of Facebook, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1528.0s)]
*  says it will now remove more posts attacking quote, Zionists, a term some use [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  interchangeably with Jews. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1540.0800000000002s)]
*  The company said it made the change in line with its longstanding policy banning attacks [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1541.52s)]
*  based on protected characteristics such as nationality, race or religion. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1546.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, the idea that Zionism or Zionist is synonymous with Jews is preposterous. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1550.08s)]
*  There are all kinds of Jewish anti-Zionists. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1555.92s)]
*  There are a huge number of Christian Zionists who aren't Jewish at all. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1559.36s)]
*  Zionism is a belief about what the Israeli state should be, namely that it should be an [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1562.4s)]
*  ethnostate dominated and run by a majority of people who are Jewish. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1566.72s)]
*  It's a philosophy. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1572.24s)]
*  It's not a group of people. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1573.2800000000002s)]
*  It's not a demographic. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1575.1200000000001s)]
*  You're allowed to oppose Zionism without being bigoted. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1576.0s)]
*  And yet Israel has done a very good job of pressuring Big Tech companies to constantly [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1579.68s)]
*  constrict the amount of speech permitted, not in Israel, but in the West, when it comes [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW8IF028w7I&t=1584.48s)]
