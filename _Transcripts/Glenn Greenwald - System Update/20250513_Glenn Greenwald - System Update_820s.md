# Can Trump Really Lower Drug Prices?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E)
*  Matt Stoller is the director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=0.0s)]
*  He is also the author of the widely acclaimed book Goliath, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=11.32s)]
*  The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly, Power, and Democracy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=14.64s)]
*  And he publishes the newsletter Big on Substack, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=17.36s)]
*  which focuses on monopoly, power, and economic policy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=20.16s)]
*  He previously served as a policy advisor to the Senate Budget Committee [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=22.96s)]
*  and worked in the House of Representatives during the financial crisis. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=26.2s)]
*  His writing has appeared everywhere. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=28.88s)]
*  He's a good friend of the show. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=30.56s)]
*  He's appeared many times because I don't think there are many people more qualified [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=31.36s)]
*  to talk both about antitrust developments as well as the attempt to find a strain [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  of economic populism that might become bipartisan, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=39.72s)]
*  both of which we want to talk about tonight. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=42.44s)]
*  And we're happy to have him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Welcome, Matt. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=44.76s)]
*  Good evening. How are you? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=45.68s)]
*  Hey, thanks for having me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=47.96s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  So it's so interesting to me because Democrats have been saying for as long as I can remember, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=50.28s)]
*  going back decades, that prescription drug prices are too high, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  that we're being gouged by pharmaceutical companies. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=62.04s)]
*  This has been basically an article of faith among everybody left of center forever. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=65.4s)]
*  And yet very little has been done about it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=71.6s)]
*  And there's excuses why. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=73.12s)]
*  We don't have the majorities. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=74.4s)]
*  We're stopped by the filibuster, whatever. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=75.32s)]
*  But not much has been done about it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=77.6s)]
*  And then Trump comes out and basically reads from exactly that script saying [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=78.76s)]
*  Americans are getting gouged by pharmaceutical companies. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  He says the reason we're always told prices are so high is because it goes into research and development. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=85.44s)]
*  But in fact, we're getting gouged because people around the world pay far less. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  And here's an executive order that tries to fix that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=93.52s)]
*  And we can talk about the mechanics of that in a minute. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=96.08s)]
*  But a lot of Democrats have come out and said, look, if you really mean this, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=97.92s)]
*  like if you mean this, first of all, we're happy you mean it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=102.72s)]
*  We want to work with you to make this measure less vulnerable to challenge legally by big pharma. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=106.12s)]
*  And so let us pass a law that basically encapsulate what it is that you just said instead of having an executive order. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=114.64s)]
*  Why does that matter? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=120.04s)]
*  So it's a great question. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=122.92s)]
*  There's a lot of context here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=125.84s)]
*  But 2003 is when Medicare Part D, which is the part of Medicare that lets old people get drugs paid for by the government, that was passed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=127.52s)]
*  And one of the big scandals in that passage was that the government was not allowed to negotiate for drug prices. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=137.12s)]
*  It was just a price taker, even though it buys a ton of drugs. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=144.12s)]
*  And that provision was modified a little bit under Biden in 2022 with the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  But it wasn't that much. And now Trump is saying, I'm just going to issue an executive order mandating international reference pricing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=155.44s)]
*  The problem is, it's pretty clear in the law that the president doesn't have the authority to do that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=164.52s)]
*  So it will lose when he tried it in 2022, it lost in the courts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  It will lose again unless it gets some sort of changes, gets passed into law. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=174.48s)]
*  And the Democrats are coming out and saying, hey, let us or some of them are saying, let us pass this into law so you have the authority to do this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=179.48s)]
*  And actually, in the press conference today, when Trump announced this, he kind of went back and forth. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=186.28s)]
*  But one of the things that he did say is, look, this is the kind of thing that I'm going to put in my one big, beautiful tax bill. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=191.48s)]
*  And I want to see the Democrats vote against that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=199.0s)]
*  So that's kind of the dynamic here. It's a little bit hard to tell what's really going on, because I think the Republicans in Congress have said they don't want this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=202.44s)]
*  They won't pass this legislation or they don't want this legislation. So it's a very weird dynamic. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=211.16s)]
*  It isn't necessarily partisan, but it's definitely being played as partisan by the Donald Trump and the Republicans and somewhat the Democrats. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=216.36s)]
*  So yeah, I just want to ask for a little bit of a delving into a bit to the political reading of this, even though I know it can be somewhat speculative. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=225.6s)]
*  But it seems to me like between just hardcore Trump loyalists who pretty much do what he wants on issues that he considers very important, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  as he touted this as one of the greatest, most important announcements ever, combined with the growing economic populism in the Republican Party, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  at least in rhetoric, if not in action, and the fact that this is incredibly popular. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=253.92s)]
*  I mean, every American, you know, pretty much is burdened by and angered by the enormous price of of medications and pharmaceutical companies that bear no relation to its cost. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump told this story. I don't know if you saw it. It was told in absolutely high grade Trump camp and humor about he said he knows this extremely rich. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  Extremely rich, very neurotic and very successful, very rich businessman in New York, who he said is also disgustingly obese. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=283.88s)]
*  And he went to London and he saw that ozempic or whatever Trump called it, like the fat drug shot. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=291.68s)]
*  The fat shot drug. Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=301.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was, you know, it cost in London, it cost something like $80. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=304.04s)]
*  And in New York, it cost something like $1400. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=308.2s)]
*  Now, I don't know how many billionaires actually go around noticing like minimal price differences. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=312.04s)]
*  I mean, they're billionaires. It's hard to imagine. But I'm sure there are some. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=318.08s)]
*  That's how they got through the billionaires in the first place. They care about every dollar. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=320.8s)]
*  Right. But I like money. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=323.28s)]
*  What's that? They like money. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=325.2s)]
*  They like money. They don't like giving away their money. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=327.52s)]
*  They don't like spending more than they have to. And they like getting as much as possible. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=329.68s)]
*  That's kind of a prerequisite for being a billionaire. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=332.44s)]
*  So, you know, I think the story Trump was telling is one that Americans very commonly understand and feel like they're getting gouged. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=335.28s)]
*  So between the political popularity, the MAGA kind of loyalist to Trump and the economic populism, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=343.28s)]
*  I would think he could gin up a decent amount of votes, certainly in the House, in the Republican caucus. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  I guess I'm wondering, would the Democrats want to join hands with Trump on an initiative that he announced [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=356.11999999999995s)]
*  that he kind of sponsored? Would they be willing to do that even for a goal that they've long said is so important to them? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=364.8s)]
*  I think so. Yeah, I think they'd vote for, you know, it depends. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, if he put it together with a bill that did a bunch of stuff they didn't like, maybe they wouldn't. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=378.0s)]
*  But if it was a standalone bill to cap or lower pharmaceutical drug prices by the pharmaceutical companies, they'd probably go for it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=382.8s)]
*  I will say one thing that's important to understand. Pharmaceutical stocks today went up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=393.8s)]
*  So there's not a lot of- Why is that? I saw that too. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=398.92s)]
*  Well, it's because there's no real authority. The president doesn't have price setting authority. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=404.12s)]
*  But Biden fought for price setting authority, lost. He wanted to do what Trump did, but he lost that fight in Congress. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=410.12s)]
*  So that authority just doesn't exist. And so I guess people on Wall Street just assume, well, Trump is going to tell HHS to do a bunch of stuff. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=416.2s)]
*  And then it'll get struck down by courts. And that's a pretty good bet. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=423.68s)]
*  So he has to get it through. I think he's going to have to get it through Congress or he won't. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=426.92s)]
*  And it'll sort of stay the way it is now, which is very high prices. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=430.68s)]
*  I mean, there are middlemen, too. There's a complicated, like weird pricing thing, which I can geek out on if you want. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=435.2s)]
*  But that's the gist of it. Yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=440.24s)]
*  I guess Trump's proposal, and if you want to just add to this, feel free or talk about it, is basically saying that for a long time, the U.S. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=443.16s)]
*  has paid, Americans have paid more for pharmaceutical products, even the ones that are made by American pharmaceutical companies than any other country in the world. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  And he wants to give most favored nation status to the United States so that there's whatever the lowest price that anyone in the world is paying for this medication is the price that the pharmaceutical companies would have to sell to Americans as well. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=460.44000000000005s)]
*  Now, let's assume that gets codified into law or gets upheld by the courts. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  Would that be really a mechanism for keeping prices lower? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, would pharmaceutical companies just jack up prices in the rest of the world? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=484.16s)]
*  Or do you think that is an effective way to deal with high pharmaceutical products? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=488.0s)]
*  So that is the idea that Trump's argument, and it's an argument from a number of economists as well, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  is that America pays too much for drugs to subsidize the rest of the world. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=503.48s)]
*  So the idea is high prices generate high profits, which then the pharmaceutical companies plow back into research. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=508.68s)]
*  And you need that money to discover drugs. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=515.8s)]
*  And so you're either going to get it from the U.S. or you're going to get it from foreigners. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=518.44s)]
*  And they've been getting it from the U.S. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=521.8s)]
*  And so what we need to do is lower prices here and raise prices abroad. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=523.64s)]
*  And that way, those profits will continue and then they can continue to do the research and will get a better deal. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=527.56s)]
*  So that's the theory. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=534.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's right, because I think that pharmaceutical companies spend a lot more money on, say, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=536.92s)]
*  advertising and patent litigation than they actually do on discovering drugs. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  And so it's like you can put a billion dollars into trying to discover a drug. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=550.92s)]
*  But what you'd probably want to do, this is a company called AbVie did it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=556.0s)]
*  They had a best selling drug that brought in about 20, 30 billion dollars a year. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=559.88s)]
*  And what they did is they brought in McKinsey to say, OK, how do we extend our patent on this drug? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=564.4s)]
*  And McKinsey's recommendation is, oh, go to your scientists and offer them free iPads if they can come up with additional things about the drug that they could patent. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  And that drug, I forget when it is, but it's one of the blockbuster ones. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=579.36s)]
*  But that was originally patented in 1991 and it finally came off patent like 2023, 2022, something like that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=583.56s)]
*  So that's crazy. It shouldn't last nearly that long. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  But that's what their incentive system in the pharmaceutical industry is not actually to discover drugs. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  It's actually to try to use all sorts of cheating to extend your patent so you can raise prices. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=598.0s)]
*  So you can attack this problem in lots of different ways. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=603.1199999999999s)]
*  You could definitely use international reference pricing, which is something Trump wants to do with some Democrats in Congress want to do. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=606.28s)]
*  You can attack it through the patent system. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=612.08s)]
*  There are middlemen which increase the price of drugs. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=614.48s)]
*  So, for example, when you buy insulin, about half of what you pay goes to these companies that are they're supposed to be bargaining for lower prices. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  But we've screwed up the incentive. So they're actually they want higher prices so they can get their cut. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  Those those companies, that's like CVS and United Health Group and and Cigna. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=630.96s)]
*  So that you could go after those middlemen. And there's some action on that front. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=636.9200000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to address to like take on lower drug pricing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=640.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty skeptical that this executive order is that meaningful. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=644.1999999999999s)]
*  There's a couple of executive orders he's done on pharmaceutical prices. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  But there is some other stuff going on. So we probably will see some good action here in this space. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=651.12s)]
*  I mean, I guess raising the issue in and of itself might be helpful in terms of just bringing attention to the to the problem and the need to combat it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=656.04s)]
*  But I also think there's this like part of the reason for maybe not wanting it codified in the Congress. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=663.52s)]
*  I think we've seen this many times with other presidents, too, especially with the ones trying to claim very robust theories of executive power, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=668.92s)]
*  which obviously Trump is claiming, is they don't want to acknowledge that their power is limited in any way that they need Congress for anything. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=675.0799999999999s)]
*  In fact, I remember in the run up to the Iraq War, the Bush, the Bush Cheney theory was we don't need Congress. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=682.8s)]
*  Like they have some executive, you know, Article 2 executive power theory about why they can do it without Congress. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=688.7199999999999s)]
*  And Congress has left begging, like, please let us vote on it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=695.64s)]
*  We promise we'll pass it. But let us vote on it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=698.72s)]
*  And they kind of just did this like meaningful, meaningless concession, knowing that they were begging and promising to vote on it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=701.2s)]
*  And they were, you know, the whole time Bush and Cheney were making clear this doesn't matter, the outcome. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=707.28s)]
*  But they voted for it overwhelmingly anyway. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=711.4s)]
*  And so I wonder if it's hard to believe that Trump would just do this like on purpose to sink his own proposal that he touted very loudly, although who knows. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=713.84s)]
*  But I wonder if you think it might have something to do with the fact that they're trying to consolidate all the power in the executive branch and don't want to concede that they need Congress to do it. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=724.4s)]
*  Well, I think that's possible. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=733.96s)]
*  I do. I would cabin that to national security and policing matters. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  I think when you're talking about these kinds of questions, the courts generally give a lot more deference to corporate power than they do to these these kind of broad claims of executive authority. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=740.76s)]
*  I think that that's possible. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=752.04s)]
*  Another possibility, though, and this might be this might sound partisan, but, you know, whatever. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=753.4s)]
*  I think that the Republicans in Congress, you know, there's a lot of anger from the MAGA base towards the establishment Republicans. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=759.6s)]
*  And this is why Republicans in Congress just won't pass this kind of thing. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=765.12s)]
*  And so they fought the Democrats aggressively when the Democrats tried to do it a couple of years ago. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=768.36s)]
*  Their relationships with the pharmaceutical industry have not changed. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=772.6s)]
*  And it's not just a money thing. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=775.88s)]
*  It's not just corruption. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=777.48s)]
*  They believe that you need that that pharmaceutical companies need really high profits in order to reinvest and do R&D. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=778.48s)]
*  So there's there's some good faith policy disagreement here as well. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=785.48s)]
*  But what no one is really talking about is the fact that the Republicans in Congress just don't want to pass this kind of thing. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2hYuJvwP2E&t=788.48s)]
