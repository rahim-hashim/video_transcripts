# The Trump Admin's Assault on Academic Freedom Hurts ALL Students
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE)
*  One of the things that has happened that I think has not gotten enough attention is being [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=0.0s)]
*  the president of an Ivy League university was previously one of the safest jobs in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=11.08s)]
*  world. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=17.68s)]
*  Just being a university president in general, I was, I remember when I went to NYU Law School [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=18.68s)]
*  and College in George Washington as well, the university president stayed for decades. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=24.92s)]
*  The president of Princeton was my constitutional law professor at NYU. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=31.96s)]
*  He was very young, maybe in his early 30s. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=36.96s)]
*  He stayed there for a few years, went to Princeton, worked his way up, became Princeton president [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=39.6s)]
*  like 1996. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=42.8s)]
*  Christopher I. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  He's still the president of Princeton. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  These are jobs that people keep for life. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=48.6s)]
*  And yet since October 7th, four different Ivy League American presidents have been [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=52.0s)]
*  forced out of their job all over the same issue, Israel, and allowing bigotry on campus [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=56.88s)]
*  to thrive, anti-Semitism. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=62.92s)]
*  Two of them at Columbia, one at Harvard, one at the University of Penn, Pennsylvania, and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=66.68s)]
*  now two at Columbia. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=71.56s)]
*  The latest Columbia professor, university president rather, was just forced out on Friday, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=73.58s)]
*  even though she agreed to all the Trump administration's terms because she reportedly, someone claimed, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  the free press claimed, Barry Weiss's pro-Israel thing claimed that she had said privately, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=86.76s)]
*  yes, I'm agreeing to these, but I'm going to slow off them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=94.4s)]
*  We're not going to just rush and do these. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=96.68s)]
*  And the Trump administration went ballistic. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Israel's supporters went ballistic and forced the second university president of Columbia [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  out in a year and replaced her with somebody who actually has appeared on the stage of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=104.7s)]
*  AIPAC to vow bipartisan loyalty to Israel, to talk about the need to keep bipartisan [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=112.38s)]
*  support and financing of Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=119.62s)]
*  She's a Jewish woman who has appeared at AIPAC and still, there's already a move to get [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  rid of her too on the grounds that she's insufficiently pro-Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=126.7s)]
*  You can be a Jewish woman who goes to AIPAC, gets up on the stage and talks about the importance [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=130.3s)]
*  of keeping bipartisan support for Israel and still be insufficiently pro-Israel to the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=136.3s)]
*  point where the government won't allow you to assume the presidency of Columbia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=141.02s)]
*  Here from the Wall Street Journal on Friday, Columbia University president steps down amid [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=144.86s)]
*  Trump battle. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=148.78s)]
*  Quote, the university's board co-chair, Claire Shipman, was named acting president. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=149.78s)]
*  Katrina Armstrong is returning to lead the school's Irving Medical Center. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=155.7s)]
*  Armstrong is the second president to exit in seven months as Columbia has navigated [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=161.14s)]
*  a series of crises stemming from pro-Palestinian protests that disrupted campuses last year. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=166.1s)]
*  Last week, the school reached an agreement with the administration that included restricting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=171.7s)]
*  masks, empowering campus police and appointing a senior vice provost with broad authority [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=175.38s)]
*  to oversee the Department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=180.2s)]
*  Over the weekend, Armstrong held closed-door meetings with anxious faculty about the deal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=183.58s)]
*  You know why the faculty is anxious? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  Because in America, the government isn't supposed to dictate the curriculum and the administration [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=192.86s)]
*  and the teaching of what can be done at our lead colleges. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=197.3s)]
*  That's supposed to be left up to academics, professors. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=201.22000000000003s)]
*  That's what academic freedom means, is the ability to teach and to say and to express [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=205.0s)]
*  yourself how you want free of government coercion and control. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  This would be like if the Biden administration came to universities and said, we're going [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=212.8s)]
*  to take away all your funding unless you fire every last conservative. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=216.56s)]
*  You still have a few conservatives on the campus. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=222.22s)]
*  They oppose affirmative action. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=224.84s)]
*  They oppose DEI. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  We think that's racist. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  You have to get rid of them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Or who say that there's only two genders and that's transphobic and it incites violence [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=230.06s)]
*  against trans people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  You have to get rid of them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  Do you think conservatives would be supporting that and saying, oh yeah, that's the role [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  of the government. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=239.68s)]
*  That's totally fine. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=240.68s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=241.68s)]
*  They should be doing the same now that Trump is doing that just in defense of a different [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=243.56s)]
*  group. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  The article goes on, quote, some faculty said they were concerned that Armstrong was playing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  down what Columbia had agreed to and presenting one message to the faculty and another to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=252.12s)]
*  the government. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=256.44s)]
*  The Trump administration pushed her to clarify her position on Tuesday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=257.6s)]
*  She issued a statement publicly affirming her commitment to the agreement on Friday [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=261.46000000000004s)]
*  after Armstrong stepped down. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  The Trump administration's anti-Semitism task force said, quote, the action taken [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=266.92s)]
*  today by Columbia's trustees, especially in light of this week's concerning revelation, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  is an important step toward advancing negotiations to set forth in the preconditional understanding [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=276.68s)]
*  reached last Friday between the university and the task force to combat anti-Semitism. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=281.56s)]
*  Is this, is going on a crusade to purge bigotry from American campuses using a combination [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=287.36s)]
*  of government coercion and control and expanded hate speech codes? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=293.6s)]
*  Is this what conservatives wanted? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=296.76s)]
*  Because I had always understood that conservatives were deeply offended by those sorts of things. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=298.84s)]
*  And the reason I thought that was because they've been screaming that for as long as [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=304.12s)]
*  I can remember. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=306.96s)]
*  One of the weird things, really weird things, is that there are a lot of members of the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=307.96s)]
*  Republican Party in Congress who are not Jewish, but who are more fanatical about Israel than [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  almost every Jewish member of Congress. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=321.14s)]
*  And they love to speak for all Jewish people they've irrigated to themselves the right [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=324.08s)]
*  to speak for Jewish people. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  So here is Congressman Michael Aulor of New York, who is not Jewish, despite how much [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=331.96s)]
*  he loves to purport to speak for Jewish people everywhere. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=336.2s)]
*  Kind of the white savior hero who comes down and protects all Jews. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  So grateful to him. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  So, so grateful. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  Kind of like the like a Robin D'Angelo type, but for Jews. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=351.1s)]
*  And the new president of Columbia, the third one, is Claire Shipman, who as I said is a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=355.22s)]
*  Jewish woman who has actually been at AIPAC. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=360.5s)]
*  She's married to Obama's former press secretary, Jay Carney, who's served for the last decade [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=364.86s)]
*  as the spokesperson for Amazon. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=369.42s)]
*  These are not actually far left radicals. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=371.90000000000003s)]
*  These are like corporatist types. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  Claire Shipman is very much pro-Israel. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=376.3s)]
*  But here is Michael Aulor on Friday saying she has to go because she's not Jewish enough. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=380.66s)]
*  He quote tweeted the New York Post. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=385.94s)]
*  The New York Post said Columbia's new president called Congress's hearings on anti-Semitism [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=387.82s)]
*  quote nonsense. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=393.98s)]
*  And then Michael Aulor said, this is a slap in the face to every Jewish student on your [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=396.66s)]
*  campus resign now. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=401.5s)]
*  She hasn't, she's the third president. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  She barely is in office like six seconds. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=404.54s)]
*  And he's saying you're offensive to all Jewish people. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  Step down. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=410.86s)]
*  Who is Michael Aulor to speak for all Jewish students? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=411.86s)]
*  Huge numbers of Jewish students participated in those protests. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=415.14000000000004s)]
*  We had them on our show. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=418.58000000000004s)]
*  In fact, so many Jewish students were participating in the protests that they had a Shabbat dinner [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=419.58000000000004s)]
*  every Friday night inside the protest encampment. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=424.36s)]
*  Here is Claire Shipman, the new president who Michael Aulor and many others think is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=429.18s)]
*  insufficiently pro-Israel to lead Columbia. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=432.38s)]
*  Here she was on the stage at APAC with the Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a virulent [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=434.94s)]
*  supporter of Israel, obviously very bipartisan. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=440.06s)]
*  And they talked about the need to maintain bipartisan support for APAC. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=444.06s)]
*  Here's just a little snippet. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=447.26s)]
*  Thanks for coming today. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  Great to be with you, Claire. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=461.94s)]
*  Thanks to APAC for a great conference and a chance to join you again. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=462.94s)]
*  Senator Coons, you just returned from a trip to Israel. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=466.90000000000003s)]
*  We were talking about it backstage. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=471.18s)]
*  It sounds as though it was fascinating. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=472.90000000000003s)]

*  I mean, the whole thing was all about Israel and how fortunate and grateful you should [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=485.34000000000003s)]

*  Here from the Columbia Spectator, the student newspaper at Columbia from yesterday, here's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=496.54s)]
*  what to know about Claire Shipman, Columbia's new acting president. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=502.06s)]
*  Quote, Shipman, an award-winning journalist, served as co-chair of the Board of Trustees [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=505.06s)]
*  before assuming the presidency. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=508.84s)]
*  She was married to Jay Carney, who served as the White House press secretary under former [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=510.64s)]
*  President Barack Obama. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=513.58s)]
*  Just a little background on her. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=517.6600000000001s)]
*  This is not some far left, pro-Hamas radical or whatever they're trying to imply she is [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=519.1s)]
*  to force out the third Columbia president in the last seven months over this one foreign [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=524.7s)]
*  country. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=530.1800000000001s)]
*  Here is Minosha Fiek, who was testifying before the House and listen to what he had to say [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=532.5400000000001s)]
*  about Columbia's administration. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=541.82s)]
*  I have seen, we have had pro-Israeli demonstrations on campus. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=545.98s)]
*  I should say this is the first, this is the president at the time that October 7th happened. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=549.78s)]
*  She made all sorts of statements condemning the protesters. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=555.02s)]
*  She called NYPD multiple times to have them all arrested. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=558.98s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=562.78s)]
*  She was forced out. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=563.9s)]
*  But here's what she was saying in April 2024 when she was still the Columbia president. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=564.9s)]
*  I have seen, we have had pro-Israeli demonstrations on campus. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=570.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=574.22s)]
*  Just a protest that was against Muslims. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=575.6600000000001s)]
*  No, I have not. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=577.6600000000001s)]
*  Have you seen one against Arabs? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=578.6600000000001s)]
*  No, I have not. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=579.6600000000001s)]
*  Have you seen one against Palestinians? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=580.6600000000001s)]
*  No, I have not. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=582.6600000000001s)]
*  Have you seen against one, against Jewish people? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=583.6600000000001s)]
*  Have you seen a protest saying we are against Jewish people? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=590.4200000000001s)]
*  No, I have seen. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=593.6600000000001s)]
*  Okay, thank you for that clarification. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=595.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, think what you want about it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=597.94s)]
*  I really don't care. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=599.38s)]
*  That was a very clever and effective way of asking this question. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=600.5400000000001s)]
*  Because she did say, yes, there have been protests against Israel. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=605.1s)]
*  And there have been protests in favor of Israel. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=609.1s)]
*  So then, Elion Omer said, are there protests against Muslims and Arabs and Palestinians? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=612.1s)]
*  Meaning the pro-Israel protest. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=619.1s)]
*  And she said, no, those weren't protests against those groups. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=620.1s)]
*  And then Elion Omer said, what about any other protests, including the protests against the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=624.1s)]
*  Israeli destruction of Gaza? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=628.2199999999999s)]
*  Were those protests against Jews? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=629.66s)]
*  And she was forced to say no, because of course they weren't. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=632.02s)]
*  This is the point. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=635.62s)]
*  Everybody involved in American discourse understands that criticism of Israel is immediately depicted [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=636.62s)]
*  as anti-Semitic. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=643.62s)]
*  I mean, you're allowed to criticize Israel as long as you're still pro-Israel. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=644.62s)]
*  You're allowed to say, oh, I think Israel should be more aggressive here, pull back [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=648.62s)]
*  a little here, think the Manitoba government's wrong when they're doing it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=655.62s)]
*  I mean, as long as you're pledging your loyalty to Israel, you can criticize them for constructive [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=658.62s)]
*  reasons to help Israel. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=662.62s)]
*  But you cannot criticize Israel in a way that shows that you're opposed to either what they're [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=664.6s)]
*  doing in wars or the US support for them. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=668.1s)]
*  That's anti-Semitic. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=671.1s)]
*  And that is what is being systemically outlawed by what the Trump administration is doing. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=673.1s)]
*  I mean, it's just true. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=680.1s)]
*  I am somebody who has spent nine years, eight years denouncing what I regarded as baseless [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=681.1s)]
*  or excessive attacks on Donald Trump, attempts to malign him, fabrications of scandal. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=688.58s)]
*  I don't just go around reflexively criticizing the Trump administration, but when I see as [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=695.58s)]
*  somebody who really does believe in the Constitution, who really does believe in the value of free [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=700.08s)]
*  speech and academic freedom and free discourse and free protest and due process, speaking [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=704.08s)]
*  of other issues as well, I'm not going to sit by and watch college campuses have their [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=711.1600000000001s)]
*  free speech rights destroyed in service of a foreign government and not say anything. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=719.24s)]
*  Here's Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, who in April of 2024 decided that he wanted [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=724.24s)]
*  to dictate who should be Colombia's president. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=731.8000000000001s)]
*  Sadly, Colombia's administrators have chosen to let the threats, the fear and the intimidation [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=734.8s)]
*  of the mob rule to overtake American principles like free speech and the free exchange of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=741.4s)]
*  ideas and the free exercise of religion. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=747.4s)]
*  They have co-opted First Amendment arguments to protect genocide and to elevate the voices [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=750.76s)]
*  of anti-Semitism. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=757.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just so ironic, so, so ironic to hear one of the leading lights of the conservative [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=759.6s)]
*  movement go to a college campus and say, we need to stop this kind of speech because it's [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=766.84s)]
*  pro-genocidal or inciting genocide. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=773.9200000000001s)]
*  You just heard the college president say there's no protest against Jews on campus. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=776.2800000000001s)]
*  There's protests against Israelis on campus, and that's because the protests are filled [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=784.72s)]
*  with Jews, Jewish critics of Israel. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=787.6s)]
*  But that's what the liberals have been doing for a decade. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=791.44s)]
*  They say, oh, you cannot criticize the trans people because that's inciting genocide. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  You cannot criticize any dogma designed to help black people get ahead because that's [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=798.4s)]
*  racist and won't incite violence against them. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=802.76s)]
*  It's hate speech, et cetera. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  You know all the arguments. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=805.76s)]
*  These are the arguments now being repeated in order to justify a censorship regime but [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=807.24s)]
*  in defense of a group that the Republican Party, for whatever reason, and there are [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  a lot of different reasons. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=816.0s)]
*  Financial, cultural, religious, ideological, holds above all the others, holds it sacred. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=817.44s)]
*  The same thing is now spreading to Harvard. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=827.08s)]
*  Here from today, the New York Times, the Trump administration will review billions of dollars [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=828.88s)]
*  in funding for Harvard. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=832.52s)]
*  Now I just want to, I will get to the point in just a second about why it is that the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  U.S. government provides research funding to American universities. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=838.96s)]
*  There's actually a very good reason for it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=844.28s)]
*  It's not, they're not funding gender studies programs. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=846.28s)]
*  These are what funds the leading research institutes in the country, in the world that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=850.4799999999999s)]
*  produce cures for diseases, scientific advancements, advances in AI and space and in tech. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  So I'll get to that in a minute. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=867.8s)]
*  But here's the Trump administration. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=868.9599999999999s)]
*  They're not threatening to withdraw financial, federal funding for all universities, just [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=870.16s)]
*  the ones that they think are allowing too much anti-Israel speech. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=874.8s)]
*  Quote, in a statement on Monday, the administration, the Trump administration says it was examining [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  about $256 million in contracts as well as another $8.7 billion in what it described [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=883.76s)]

*  official at the general, just let me go back a little bit. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=902.24s)]
*  Let me just read you this quote. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=906.12s)]

*  Alan M. Garber, Harvard's president, was not immediately available for comment. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=929.28s)]
*  I should add that Harvard's current president, and I think it's like six out of the last [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=934.4799999999999s)]

*  Some vocally, it's a diversity of opinion, which is what we're supposed to have. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=957.68s)]

*  This is why we have these kinds of government funding. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1000.2800000000001s)]
*  In fact, Mark Andreessen, who was one of the people credited correctly with developing [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1007.8s)]
*  the modern internet in the late 1990s, he is credited with developing the browser Netscape [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1014.8399999999999s)]
*  that was then sold to Microsoft. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1022.04s)]
*  He's now become a very vocal Trump supporter. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1024.52s)]
*  His firm Andreessen Horowitz has people placed all around the Trump administration. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1028.8s)]
*  He spent time with Mar-a-Lago a lot of time in the transition. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1034.32s)]
*  He's a Trump supporter, Mark Andreessen, and he gave an interview to the New York Times [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1037.2s)]
*  columnist Roth Duthout on January 17th, just a few days before the administration was to [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1042.92s)]
*  take office, the Trump administration. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1051.24s)]
*  The title was How Democrats Drove Silicon Valley into Trump's Arms. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1052.72s)]
*  Mark Andreessen explains the newest faction of conservatism. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1057.8s)]
*  One of the things Mark Andreessen pointed out in this interview was that the reason [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1062.5200000000002s)]
*  the United States developed the internet, the reason the United States became a leader [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1067.3600000000001s)]
*  of the internet, the reason Silicon Valley exists, it drove so much American wealth, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1070.8400000000001s)]
*  is because the US government funded so many academic research institutions to do research [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1076.48s)]
*  into the internet, into browsing, into all of that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1082.98s)]
*  That's why we fund American academic institutions, because it produces innovation and benefits [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1087.52s)]
*  that benefit the entire country. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1094.12s)]
*  Here's what Andreessen said, quote, basically I'm a product of the great land grant universities, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1096.2s)]
*  the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1101.52s)]
*  It was a huge leap to actually leave that state and go to a university that large where [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  I came from. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1109.0s)]
*  And they had this incredible influx of money at the time from the federal government for [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1110.0s)]
*  supercomputers and what turned out to be the internet. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1114.08s)]
*  He went on, actually by the way that was kind of led by Al Gore when he was in the Senate. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1118.1999999999998s)]
*  I always thought he got unfairly treated by how people described this later. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1123.6s)]
*  But he led the push and then Dufault interjects, oh you mean that he took the lead on inventing [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1128.1999999999998s)]
*  the internet. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1132.4399999999998s)]
*  That was one of the things, when Al Gore was running for president in 2000, conservatives [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1133.6999999999998s)]
*  attacked him for saying I invented the internet. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1137.6s)]
*  And here's Andreessen about that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1140.32s)]
*  So the famous quote is I invented the internet. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1142.16s)]
*  He actually never said that. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1144.8400000000001s)]
*  I'll defend Al Gore's honor to the death. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1146.0s)]
*  What he said is I took the lead in the Senate in creating the internet. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1148.2s)]
*  What he meant is that he was the tip of the spear for funding for national supercomputing [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1151.64s)]
*  centers. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1157.44s)]
*  They picked four college campuses and Illinois was one of them. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1158.52s)]
*  So the Illinois campus when I was there was like living in the future. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1161.44s)]
*  We had computers which literally cost up to $30 million a pop that basically were representative [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1166.2s)]
*  of what was to come. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1171.04s)]
*  We just had them a decade before everybody else because of this program. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1173.04s)]
*  So if you're going to take the view that the American government should just stop funding [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1179.32s)]
*  universities, you can certainly take that view. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1183.6399999999999s)]
*  That's the right, the US government is not forced to fund research institutes at universities. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1186.04s)]
*  But it would cripple innovation in the United States if you did that. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  But that's not even what's happening here. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1195.44s)]
*  The Trump administration is not defunding American academic institutions. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1196.68s)]
*  They're using that funding as leverage to force them to be less permissive about criticism [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1201.76s)]
*  of Israel on their campus. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1208.64s)]
*  And they're all complying because as the president of Harvard said, we wouldn't be the leading [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1210.44s)]
*  academic institute that we were if we lost federal funding. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1215.48s)]
*  It's not the classroom that makes us the leading institutes that are, that we can attract the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1218.76s)]
*  leaders of each field knowing that they'll have the opportunity to engage in research [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1224.6399999999999s)]
*  that leads to cures, leads to innovations that then benefits the entire country. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1228.32s)]
*  But the Trump administration is not defunding universities. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1236.6799999999998s)]
*  They're just using it as a leverage to suppress speech they dislike. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1239.8799999999999s)]
*  Here from the Jewish News Syndicate on March 31, 2025, this happened on Friday night as [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1244.76s)]
*  well. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1249.92s)]
*  The head of Harvard's Middle East Studies Program, Study Center told to step down by [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1250.92s)]
*  the end of the year, quote, Rabbi David Wolpe, a former member of Harvard's Anti-Semitism [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1256.3200000000002s)]
*  Advisory Group, said that the change in leadership was, quote, good news. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1261.5600000000002s)]
*  Just like they're changing the control of Columbia's Middle East Study Program, they're [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1266.52s)]
*  doing the same at Harvard now. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1270.88s)]
*  So that people like Rabbi David Wolpe can step in, just like Benjamin Nahu was celebrating, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1274.4s)]
*  like David Friedman was threatening, to outlaw criticism of Israel. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1280.44s)]
*  They've always been very concerned that American academic institutions were the epicenter of [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1284.0800000000002s)]
*  protests against Israel. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1290.16s)]
*  And this is not the first time, by the way, that disruptive protests have happened across [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1292.96s)]
*  American college campuses. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1297.0s)]
*  It's kind of an iconic tradition in American academic life. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1298.6000000000001s)]
*  In part because when you're 18 and 20 and 21, you're looking for your political expression, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1304.2s)]
*  you're 23, 24, a grad student. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1308.2s)]
*  You're much more apt to protest than when you have a family and a job. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1310.72s)]
*  So protesting is a young person's activity in general. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1314.28s)]
*  So when you congregate a bunch of young people on a college campus, it's likely to lead to [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1319.2s)]
*  protests. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1325.2s)]
*  I certainly had a lot of protests at the schools I went to. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1326.2s)]
*  Obviously, it was one of the things that helped stop the Vietnam War. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1331.2s)]
*  Protests were often violent and disruptive at colleges across the United States in the [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1335.72s)]
*  60s against the Vietnam War in favor of the Civil Rights Movement, far more so than these [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1340.84s)]
*  protests were. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1344.24s)]
*  One of the things that scares Israel and its supporters so much was that the epicenter [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1345.72s)]
*  of activism against the apartheid regime in South Africa that helped to bring it down [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1350.28s)]
*  was a protest movement throughout American campuses demanding that their schools divest [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1357.04s)]
*  from South Africa to bring down the apartheid regime. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1361.96s)]
*  And that's why Israel wants to make it illegal. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1365.3999999999999s)]
*  And in many places in Europe, they've done so and have started to do so in the United [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1366.8s)]
*  States too to advocate a boycott of Israel. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1369.76s)]
*  So they look at the United States, Israel does, and they're like, where do we need to [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1374.52s)]
*  go to stop this growing sentiment against our country? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1379.2s)]
*  Oh, well, TikTok. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1384.2s)]
*  Here's TikTok. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1385.8s)]
*  We still have a lot of Israel criticism. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1387.56s)]
*  We need to ban that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1389.68s)]
*  The U.S. said ban that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1390.68s)]
*  And that's what caused enough votes from the Democratic Party to finally ban TikTok, not [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1392.1s)]
*  in fear of China, but a fear that after October 7th, TikTok was allowing too much pro-Palestinian [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  or anti-Israel speech. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1400.6s)]
*  So they got rid of TikTok, or at least Trump for now was ignoring it. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1402.04s)]
*  But at some point, they're going to force a sale or ban it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1406.36s)]
*  And then college campuses were the other place. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1410.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's what their target is. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1411.68s)]
*  It's a foreign country targeting the civil liberties and free speech rights and academic [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  freedom of our country that have long been crucial to our country's prosperity. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-6esXtLApE&t=1416.64s)]
