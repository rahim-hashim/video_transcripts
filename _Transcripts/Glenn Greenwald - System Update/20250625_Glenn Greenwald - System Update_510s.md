# Prof. John Mearsheimer: The Israel Lobby LOSING GROUND?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg)
*  My perception is there's a lot more space now in the discourse for not just space, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=0.0s)]
*  people are using that space to now really keep asking like, wait a minute, why are we [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  just always talking about Israel? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=17.64s)]
*  Why are our politicians so devoted to Israel? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=19.56s)]
*  Why is our foreign policy shaped around Israel? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=22.64s)]
*  Why do we accept censorship for them? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Why do we go to wars for them? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=25.92s)]
*  A lot of people who even two years ago were afraid to say it are now saying it quite vocally. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=27.6s)]
*  Do you think that has been a significant change and improvement in terms of the ability and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  willingness even of American politicians, let alone just ordinary Americans to raise [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=39.32s)]
*  these kind of questions? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=43.32s)]
*  When you wrote your book, there was no space practically. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=45.28s)]
*  You created that space, but it took up until now for it to really people to get comfortable [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=47.88s)]
*  and have it be almost mainstreamed. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=52.2s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with everything you said. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=54.6s)]
*  You want to remember we published the book in 2007 and the article was published in the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=57.36s)]
*  London Review of Books in 2006, and that's approximately 20 years ago. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=63.24s)]
*  So a lot of time has passed and over the passage of those 19 or 20 years, a lot's happened [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=67.92s)]
*  to make people aware of what the lobby is up to. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=76.4s)]
*  And I would argue that what's happened since October 7th has made it manifestly clear to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  huge numbers of people what the lobby is all about and how it really perverts American [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=85.32s)]
*  foreign policy in ways that are not in the American national interest. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  Let me make two additional points about that, Glenn. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  One is you want to understand that defending Israel has become increasingly difficult for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=101.24s)]
*  the lobby and they therefore have to play smash mouth politics and they have to do it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  in a very public way. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=115.12s)]
*  So people now see the lobby in operation, engaging in smash mouth politics, smearing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=116.92s)]
*  people as anti-Semites, calling Jews even anti-Semites or self-hating Jews in ways that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=124.04s)]
*  sort of cut against the way we're supposed to operate here in the United States. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=131.88s)]
*  And this has done great damage to the lobby. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=136.76s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=139.0s)]
*  Second point I would make to you, there's a domestic dimension to this and that has [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=140.4s)]
*  to do with what's happening on college campuses. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  You had all these protests against the genocide in Gaza, and these were people who were [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  legitimately protesting the Gaza genocide. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  And what happened was they were tart and feathered as anti-Semites. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Many of them were deported, put in jail. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=167.12s)]
*  This is ludicrous. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, I spent my life in academia and up until October 7th, nobody, I mean, nobody [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=171.04s)]
*  ever talked about anti-Semitism in academia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  The idea that Harvard and Columbia had an anti-Semitism problem is laughable. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, if you look at who the presidents of these institutions have been over time, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=185.48s)]
*  who the provosts and deans and department chairs are, donors, I mean, you know, huge [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  numbers of Jews occupied these institutions, which in my opinion, and I want to be clear [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=196.32s)]
*  on this, was a wonderful thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. But there was no anti-Semitism problem. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=203.16s)]
*  I never once ran into anyone talking in anti-Semitic terms. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  It just didn't happen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=211.48s)]
*  But all of a sudden, after October 7th, these places became hotbeds of anti-Semitism. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  And these people who were out there, many of them who were Jews, right, who were [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=218.72s)]
*  protesting the genocide in Gaza, were torn and feathered. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=224.08s)]
*  And everybody understands what's going on here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=228.24s)]
*  Right. Everybody understands that what's happened is that the lobby has moved in and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=231.0s)]
*  they want to shut down criticism of Israel. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  And the way they're shutting down criticism of Israel is they're using what Steve and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=239.28s)]
*  I called in the book, the great silencer, which is the charge of anti-Semitism. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  So these protesters of genocide were all of a sudden turned into raving anti-Semites. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Again, even though there was a big Jewish contingent in all of those protests, campus [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=256.2s)]
*  protest movements as well. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=260.56s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  But I would just say to you, you know, you go to a college campus, you're dealing with [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=264.88s)]
*  people who have IQs that are up in the 120, 130, 150 range and they can figure out very [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=268.6s)]
*  quickly what's going on. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  This is very bad for the lobby. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=277.04s)]
*  Right. It's very bad for the lobby. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=279.24s)]
*  And I'm just saying to you, don't lose sight of this dimension in addition to the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=281.12s)]
*  smash mouth politics that's being played vis a vis Israel's foreign policy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=285.8s)]
*  And I would add my final point on this is that I think if you look forward, if you [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=292.12s)]
*  look at what's going to happen in the months and years ahead, I think the lobby is going [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=300.04s)]
*  to have to be out in public, engaging in these kind of despicable ways for the foreseeable [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=304.52s)]
*  future for the purpose of defending Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=313.44s)]
*  And this is now reaching the point. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=315.96s)]
*  This is what you were getting at, where so many people understand what's going on, that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=318.64s)]
*  probably will hurt the lobby and will hurt Israel in the long term. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  One of the ironies of it is a major grievance of conservatives over the past decade, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=329.88000000000005s)]
*  arguably their principal one, but certainly one of the top grievances that conservatives [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=336.72s)]
*  were voicing is that what liberals do, Democrats do in order to shut down debate is they [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=340.88000000000005s)]
*  call people racist, they call people misogynist, they call people homophobic, transphobic, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=346.24s)]
*  etc. as a way of smearing them and preventing any kind of dogma from being questioned upon [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=350.68s)]
*  pain of standing accused of being a racist. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=355.88s)]
*  And I think there was an immediate backlash to that, not immediate, but certainly over [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=358.32s)]
*  time that not only made that tactic less effective, but it also drained those terms of their sting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, if you overuse it, if everybody's a racist the minute you disagree with the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=372.2s)]
*  Democratic Party plank, then people are going to get to the point where they're going to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  say, I don't think this term matters that much. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  It seems to me like nobody has done more to trivialize the term anti-Semite or anti-Semitism [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=381.32s)]
*  or actually to drain it of its capacity to be a great silencer more than the people who [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=387.8s)]
*  have just almost gotten hysterical and desperate, seeing these polling numbers change, seeing [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=392.92s)]
*  these questions being raised about Israel to now just start almost hysterically and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=399.24s)]
*  manically branding everyone an anti-Semite. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  That's going to create a lot of resentment but also weaken their primary tactic. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=406.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=411.24s)]
*  You don't want to lose sight of the fact that all of this behavior, including the complaints [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=414.04s)]
*  of conservatives about the attacks on free speech before October 7th, that all of this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  behavior undermines free speech. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=430.44s)]
*  In a liberal democracy like the United States, which we all love, it's very important that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=433.88s)]
*  these fundamental values not be undermined. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=439.88s)]
*  The idea that you're not free to criticize Israel is a threat to free speech in the United [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=444.52s)]
*  States. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a threat to fundamental liberal values. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=449.8s)]
*  This is a terrible thing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=452.92s)]
*  But this is where we are. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=454.76s)]
*  There are just so many things that you can't talk about anymore on college campuses. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=456.52s)]
*  People look over their shoulder when they talk about all sorts of issues. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=461.4s)]
*  It has to do with black-white relations, affirmative action. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=466.36s)]
*  Israel, Palestine, and so forth and so on. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=470.84s)]
*  This is a terrible situation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=473.32s)]
*  We should be free to have an open discourse about these matters. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=474.76s)]
*  But that's not where we are today. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Hu8BaGIcg&t=480.92s)]
