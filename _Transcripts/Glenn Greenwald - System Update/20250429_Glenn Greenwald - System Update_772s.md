# BBC Documentary Reveals SUPREMACIST Ideology of Israeli Settlers
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA)
*  There's a documentarian named Louis Thoreau who's been a celebrated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=0.0s)]
*  documentarian for quite a while. He is Jewish. He's a British Jew and he made a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=12.0s)]
*  film about the settler movement I think 13-14 years ago in the West Bank but [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  this time the BBC commissioned a new documentary for him to go to the West [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=24.66s)]
*  Bank and report on what is now when he reported on it then it was like a fringe [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=28.2s)]
*  group. Israeli politicians kept it arms-length. They often condemned them but [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=33.04s)]
*  now with them being completely mainstream occupying the highest [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=41.64s)]
*  position of government Ben Gavir is a huge complete supporter of the settlement [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  movement. He went back to the West Bank and produced a documentary for the BBC [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=49.44s)]
*  and it's a shocking documentary it's about an hour long you can watch it [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=54.4s)]
*  online now and what's amazing about it is it went through BBC's editorial [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=57.64s)]
*  process and they're extremely careful to put that mildly about the criticism [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=62.08s)]
*  they're willing to express about Israel and yet most of what he did was just go [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=67.36s)]
*  and put a microphone in front of the leaders of this movement just like I [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=75.2s)]
*  showed you all I showed you was what Israel's most vocal supporters in the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=79.84s)]
*  US are saying I didn't put commentary around it in terms of like putting on [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=84.96s)]
*  the video I didn't use graphics or any kind of disorder I just played for you [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=89.32s)]
*  what they say in front of the microphone and that's what he basically did in this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=94.32s)]
*  video one of the stars the documentary is Daniella Weiss she has been [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  working on annexation of the West Bank and Gaza she wants Israel to and the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=105.44s)]
*  Jewish people to control all of it and there's a lot of clips circulating online [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=111.74s)]
*  ten minutes or so about the things she said here's just a small clip [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=117.33999999999999s)]
*  settlers do not wake up in the morning or do not go wait for sundown to attack [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=121.78s)]
*  no no no no why should we wake up in the morning and think about violence why our [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=130.22s)]
*  life is good because you want the Palestinians to leave no no no no you've [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=137.82s)]

*  permitted to eat up the West Bank the more impossible that would become and the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=431.06s)]
*  assumption was like at some point the IDF has to go and remove these settlers [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=434.78s)]
*  even though they the settlers always said we'll have a war with our military [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=438.7s)]
*  if they try and remove us from this land but that was always assumption it was [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=442.94s)]
*  always the view of the US government that settlements and its expansion were [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=447.5s)]
*  a danger a threat to a harm to American national interests and that's why the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=452.02s)]
*  Bush 41 administration tried to say we're not going to continue to give you [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=460.06s)]
*  loan guarantees Israel unless you stop the settlement expansions that was Bush [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=462.94s)]

*  of Israel Republican supporter of Israel just destroyed his reputation and since [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=490.86s)]
*  then nobody's really been able to stand up in the United States to Israel but it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=496.14s)]
*  still has been the policy that all of this that we're enabling that they're [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=499.66s)]
*  doing is contrary to American interests because Colin Powell has said David [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=502.82s)]
*  Petraeus has said generals have long said that a major cause of anti-American [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=507.22s)]
*  hatred in that region is the understanding that we support the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=512.5400000000001s)]
*  Israelis as they attack Palestinians and the Lebanese and the Syrians [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=515.94s)]
*  basically however they want and then terrorist attacks come to our soil [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=519.26s)]
*  fueled in part by our support for Israel and so that's why American policymakers [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=524.7s)]
*  have always said we want this conflict to end and we want it to end with a two [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=531.74s)]
*  state solution Trump knows that's impossible which is why he's now talking [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=536.26s)]
*  about expelling Gazans turning it into a you know Trump casino and Taj Mahal that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=540.46s)]
*  the Israelis own and that Trump benefits from just get all the Gazans out and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=546.1s)]
*  that has been the point of the war from the beginning it's not about the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=551.7s)]
*  hostage is not about vengeance against Hamas for October 7th is not even about [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=555.06s)]
*  preventing Hamas from governing Gazans it's see what these people are saying [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=560.3s)]
*  they think this is their land even though the entire world thinks it isn't [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=564.5s)]
*  and all of this that we're paying for all of this that we're arming all of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=569.18s)]
*  this we're tying ourselves to for 30 years has been considered to be a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=575.42s)]
*  destruction of American interests and yet we place Israeli interests first for [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=579.86s)]
*  the reason that Tucker Carlson said in part that it's because Israel floods our [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2SHSKkwTA&t=585.22s)]
