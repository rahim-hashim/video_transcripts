# CRISE DIPLOMÁTICA: Declaração de Lula Cria Atrito com Israel
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ)
*  Here is what Lula said on February 18th. This is an excerpt from a Reuters report and he's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=0.0s)]
*  speaking in Portuguese, which is the language of Brazil, but the English translation is [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=12.96s)]
*  provided on the subtitles by Reuters on the screen. This is Lula on February 18th. This [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=18.32s)]
*  is what has sparked one of the most intense and rapidly unfolding diplomatic conflict [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=23.78s)]
*  between two major countries that we have seen in quite some time. Here is what Lula said. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=28.92s)]
*  When I see the rich world announcing that it is stopping to contribute to the humanitarian [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=58.92s)]
*  issue for the Palestinians, I keep imagining the size of the political consciousness of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=70.16s)]
*  these people and the size of the solidarity heart of these people, which is not seeing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=76.8s)]
*  So that was a speech that caused so much uproar by the Israeli government, and I guess we should [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=82.4s)]
*  add before we get into the substance that that last statement, the last part of that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=104.12s)]
*  statement, namely that Gaza has no trained army. They have no air force. They cannot fly. They have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=108.0s)]
*  no real military of any kind. They're not a state. It's not really a war. It's not a war between two [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=115.76s)]
*  armies like the way you say it is in Ukraine and Russia. It's an attack by one of the world's most [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=120.8s)]
*  sophisticated militaries financed and backed by the most powerful government on the planet, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=128.88s)]
*  which is the United States, providing it all the arms it wants and all the weapons and bombs that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=133.08s)]
*  it uses and all the money that it needs to attack one of the most densely packed populations on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=137.76s)]
*  the planet filled with civilians. It's a population of 2.2 million people in Gaza, 50% of whom are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=144.44s)]
*  children. 50% are under the age of 18. You add into that women and that constitutes 75% of the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=151.0s)]
*  population. And then innocent men, you're up to 80, 85% of the population, at least. And yet you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=158.76s)]
*  have just a complete massacre for five months now. Here from the New York Times, February 19th, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=167.48s)]
*  it describes or summarizes the results from Lula's speech. Here's the headline. Brazil's president [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=174.84s)]
*  angers Israel after comparing war in Gaza to the Holocaust. Israel said it had asked for a meeting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=184.32s)]
*  with the Brazilian ambassador. Quote, Mr. Lula's statement outraged Israeli officials. The Israeli [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=190.04s)]
*  foreign minister, Israel Katz, said in a statement on social media in Hebrew that the remarks were, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=195.12s)]
*  quote, shameful and egregious. He said that Brazil's ambassador will be called into his office on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  Monday for a, quote, reprimand, adding that no one will harm Israel's right to defend itself. Prime [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel echoed those sentiments in his own social media post. Mr. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu accused Brazil's president of, quote, trivializing the Holocaust and trying to harm the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  Jewish people and Israel's right to defend itself and said that, quote, comparing Israel to the Nazi [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=222.36s)]
*  Holocaust and Hitler is crossing a red line. I just want you to remember that. Netanyahu said that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  comparing Israel to the Nazi Holocaust and Hitler is crossing a red line, even though as we just saw, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  Israel frequently, as does the United States, compares its enemies to Nazis, to Hitler. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=243.56s)]
*  Countries in the world can freely be compared to Adolf Hitler, to Nazis. The Holocaust can [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=248.8s)]
*  continuously be invoked by the West and its allies to accuse other governments or regimes [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=256.32s)]
*  of being barbaric and savage. But invoking that argument or that historical lesson when talking [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=262.76s)]
*  about Israel, says Benjamin Netanyahu, representing, I think, a significant bulk of opinion in the West, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=270.52s)]
*  is, quote, crossing a red line. In other words, you're free to use that example for almost every [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=277.12s)]
*  other country, but not Israel. Israel is exempt from any lessons that you might want to derive from [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  the Holocaust. Quote, Mr. Netanyahu added in a separate statement that Mr. Lula has, quote, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=288.76s)]
*  disgraced the memory of the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis and demonized the Jewish [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=295.2s)]
*  state like the most virulent anti-Semite. I just want to ask for one second. I just showed you [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=300.76s)]
*  Lula's quote. Actually, and as I said, the speech itself was much more nuanced. It was vehemently [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=310.52s)]
*  denouncing Hamas and the attack on October 7th and the use of sexual violence and threats of it, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=318.52s)]
*  he said, and the attacks on civilians that were inexcusable and indefensible and the use of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=327.08s)]
*  hostages. He talked about all of that. But even if he didn't, even if he had only said the part [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=333.4s)]
*  that we showed you, the part that's circulating on social media, in what conceivable way could [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=340.36s)]
*  that be anti-Semitism? He's criticizing the actions of a state, of a government, of political [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=346.32s)]
*  leaders, Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet, the people running this war. He's criticizing them [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=353.12s)]
*  for insufficient concern for the lives of civilians. In what conceivable way is that an argument [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=360.0s)]
*  that is expressing animosity toward Jews generally? Obviously, we know what this is. This is the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=367.76s)]
*  attempt that Israel always uses and its supporters here at the United States to accuse anybody [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=376.4s)]
*  who criticized Israel of being anti-Semitic. They have conflated the Israeli government with [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=384.4s)]
*  Jews generally, even though, especially in this war, the war in Gaza, so many prominent Jews and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=389.2s)]
*  ordinary Jews around the world have been among the leaders, the most vocal opponents of the war [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=395.76s)]
*  in Gaza to claim that somehow criticizing the Israeli government, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=403.2s)]
*  was an attack on all Jews is exactly the tactic that Israel's supporters complain about when done by [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  the left or by American liberals, namely calling everybody racist or xenophobic or transphobic or [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=416.72s)]
*  whatever to stifle debate and destroy people's reputations. It's exactly the same thing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, in case that wasn't enough, here's what the official Twitter account of Israel said today. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=428.8s)]
*  Here was a playful little tweet about Brazil and the Brazilian flag posted by this account, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=437.12s)]
*  World of Statistics, and they asked, what comes to mind when you think of Brazil? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=444.8s)]
*  And the state of Israel, the official Israeli account, took this tweet and above it wrote, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  quote, before or after Lula went full on Holocaust denier. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=456.96s)]
*  This is insanely dishonest, if not stupid. What Lula was saying was that we don't have a historical [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=466.0s)]
*  precedent for what is being done in Gaza, the level of civilian destruction, the disregard for [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=475.2s)]
*  human life, unless you go back to the Holocaust, when the Germans tried to murder all Jews. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=479.28s)]
*  Now, you may not agree with what Lula said in that comparison. You may think it's overboard, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  but in no conceivable way is it Holocaust denialism. It's, in fact, the opposite. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=492.23999999999995s)]
*  It's using the Holocaust and the evils of it and drawing lessons from it about how human beings [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  can be dehumanized in order to condemn what the Israelis are doing in Gaza. Now, again, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  whatever that is, it is not anti-Semitism and is not Holocaust denialism, not in any conceivable [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=510.88s)]
*  way. Now, one of the reasons that the Israelis acted so emotionally, so full of rage, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=518.56s)]
*  is because the reality is that Brazil is a large and important country. It's the sixth largest [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=530.4s)]
*  country in the world by population. It's the largest country in South America. It has very [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=536.0s)]
*  important oil reserves and environmental resources. It's the world's tenth largest economy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=541.84s)]
*  And Lula, for better or for worse, you may hate him or not, but the reality is that he is a very [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=548.72s)]
*  credible figure on the world stage. He's not Nicolas Maduro. He's not some leader of a small [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=554.1600000000001s)]
*  African country that has no respect. Brazil's diplomatic work is regarded as being among the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=563.36s)]
*  best, if not the best in the world. Brazil has always been able to maintain a significant [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=570.48s)]
*  presence on the world stage, and especially when Lula was president from 2002 to 2010, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  Brazil worked a lot to build an independent profile, independent of the United States and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=581.52s)]
*  of other blocs, and was effective in negotiating all sorts of diplomatic arrangements, including [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=586.32s)]
*  attempting with Turkey to solve the crisis that had arisen during the Obama administration between [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=594.0s)]
*  Iran and the United States by negotiating a deal between Iran and the United States to try and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  resolve that crisis. And so for someone like Lula to come out and say something like this [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=603.12s)]
*  is a huge deal for Israel. And already you're seeing the effects here from the city paper of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=608.8s)]
*  Bogota, which is the paper in the capital of Colombia. You may recall last week when I was [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  traveling, we interviewed the top advisor to President Petro, the newly elected president of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=623.12s)]
*  Colombia, elected in 2022. We interviewed Gustavo Bolivar, who's his closest advisor. We talked [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  him about all sorts of issues involving Colombia, the region, the fight against the drug war, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=637.52s)]
*  but also Colombia's condemnation of Israel in Gaza and why Colombia felt compelled to do that. And [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=641.92s)]
*  the president of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, came out, quote, in complete solidarity with Lula today on [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=647.68s)]
*  Gaza, escalating tensions again with Israel. Quote, Colombian president Gustavo Petro made [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=654.8s)]
*  it very clear on his social media platform, X, that Brazil's Lula Nácea Lula da Silva had, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  quote, spoken the truth when he mentioned that there is a, quote, genocide in Gaza and thereby [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=665.68s)]
*  deserves his complete solidarity. In his most recent statement to 7.5 million followers regarding [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=670.7199999999999s)]
*  the Israel Hamas war, Petro underscored that, quote, thousands of children, women and elderly [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=676.4799999999999s)]
*  civilians are being cowardly murdered and that truth must be, quote, defended or barbarism will [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  annihilate us. Petro called on, quote, the entire region to unite immediately to end the violence in [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=686.4799999999999s)]
*  Palestine and emphasized that the ruling of the International Court of Justice on Israel, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=692.56s)]
*  quote, must generate application and consequence in the diplomatic relations of all countries [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=696.8s)]
*  in the world. Now, all of this invokes a very important debate about who is the owner of the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=701.8399999999999s)]
*  discourse about the Holocaust? Who gets to dictate how the lessons of the Holocaust, the lessons of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  Nazism, the lessons of World War II get applied? Remember, the state of Israel didn't even exist [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=717.04s)]
*  at the time that Nazi Germany was defeated and the camps, the concentration camps liberated. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=723.68s)]
*  That was done by the United States and the UK and Russia, the Soviet Union, the allied powers, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  they lost many, many lives in order to do that. And you can say the lessons of the Holocaust [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=739.92s)]
*  belongs to Jews who were the primary victim of it, but not the only victim. But six million Jews [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=746.24s)]
*  were killed in the Holocaust, obviously a gigantic event in the history of international jewelry. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=752.16s)]
*  But it's also a lesson for all of humanity and for the countries that fought wars [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  in order to battle against Nazism. And oftentimes the people who are invoking the Holocaust in order [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=767.12s)]
*  to condemn the actions of Israelis and specifically the treatment of Jews are some of the leading [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=775.52s)]
*  Jewish intellectuals on the planet. And that isn't only the case now, it's been the case almost since [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=779.76s)]
*  the creation of the state of Israel. Earlier this week, the Polk Awards were announced. They're the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=785.28s)]
*  second most prestigious awards for journalism after the Pulitzers. And a Polk Award was given [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=794.0s)]
*  for essays to the American-Russian Jewish writer Masha Gessen, who is a writer for The New Yorker. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=801.28s)]
*  And on December 9th of 2023, Gessen wrote an article entitled In the Shadow of the Holocaust, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=808.16s)]
*  where essentially the discussion was that Gessen had gone through all sorts of sites in Germany [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=817.28s)]
*  and in Europe, looking at Holocaust monuments and came to realize that especially in Germany, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=824.4s)]
*  especially in Europe, the Holocaust has to become this shield, this weapon to immunize Israel from [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=829.9200000000001s)]
*  criticism. When in fact the lessons of the Holocaust were seen almost from the end of World War II as [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=837.12s)]
*  something far more universal than that. And this was the sub-headline, quote, how the politics of [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=843.44s)]
*  memory in Europe obscures what we see in Israel and Gaza today. And this is a really interesting [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=850.08s)]
*  incident remembered, recalled by Gessen. And for this essay, Masha Gessen had an event to speak [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=856.08s)]
*  in Germany, and that event was canceled after Germans complained that this article was anti-Semitic, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=864.24s)]
*  even though Gessen is a Jew, a born Jew, and was speaking for a lot of Jewish critics of Israel. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=871.76s)]
*  And one of the things Gessen recalled was a historical event involving the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=880.4000000000001s)]
*  Jewish-German philosopher Hannah Arendt, who wrote essays reflecting on the Holocaust. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=884.96s)]
*  She went to the Nuremberg trials. She observed Adolf Eichmann on the stand [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  and coined the phrase the banality of evil. She was shocked that these Nazis who were being tried [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=896.72s)]
*  at the Nuremberg trials were not these monsters breathing fire. A lot of them just seemed like [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=901.84s)]
*  banal accountants carrying out their duties and their orders, and she described that as the banality [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=907.12s)]
*  of evil, that it's not often the crazy psychopaths who engage in the worst conduct, but oftentimes [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=911.92s)]
*  just the good decent man doing what he's told, adhering to societal norms. And this essay recalled [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=919.76s)]
*  the following, quote, in 1948, the year Israel was created and founded, three years after World War [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  II ended. Hannah Arendt wrote an open letter that began, quote, among the most disturbing political [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=934.56s)]
*  phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the, quote, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=941.04s)]
*  Freedom Party, a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=946.88s)]
*  and social appeal to the Nazi and fascist parties, end quote. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=953.76s)]
*  Guess and then wrote, quote, just three years after the Holocaust, Arendt was comparing a Jewish [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=958.96s)]
*  Israeli party to the Nazi party, an act that today would be a clear violation of the IHRA's [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=963.12s)]
*  definition of anti-Semitism, which is the piece of legislation that has been enacted in Europe [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  to criminalize as anti-Semitism certain types of criticism of the state of Israel. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  So here you have one of the most prominent Jewish philosophers and writers of the 20th century, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=982.56s)]
*  Hannah Arendt, invoking the Holocaust to condemn far-right nationalists in Israel during the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=986.7199999999999s)]
*  formation of the state of Israel for using Nazi rhetoric and Nazi tactics and a Nazi mindset [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=995.04s)]
*  toward Arabs that was redolent of what she saw at the Nuremberg trials. There was never any sense [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1003.1199999999999s)]
*  that Israel or Israelis or Jews were somehow off limits to having the lessons of the Holocaust [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1009.0400000000001s)]
*  applied to them the way that Benjamin and Yahoo tries today to insist Israel is immune and that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1014.4000000000001s)]
*  only anti-Semites would do. And then Guess and talked about the trial of, or rather, Arendt [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1020.64s)]
*  was talking about the trial of Adolf Eichmann and wrote the following, quote, here was the devil [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1028.32s)]
*  himself. The prosecution argued that Eichmann represented but one iteration of the eternal [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1033.28s)]
*  threat to the Jews. The trial helped to solidify the narrative that to prevent annihilation, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1038.16s)]
*  Jews should be prepared to use force preemptively. Arendt reporting on the trial would have none of [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  this. Her phrase, quote, the banality of evil, elicited perhaps the original accusations leveled [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1049.3600000000001s)]
*  against a Jew of trivializing the Holocaust, and the Jews of Israel, the Jews of Israel, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1055.2s)]
*  the Jews of Israel. But she saw that Eichmann was no devil, that perhaps the devil didn't exist. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1059.8400000000001s)]
*  She had reason that there was no such thing as radical evil. That evil was always ordinary, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1069.2s)]
*  even when it was extreme, something, quote, born in the gutter, as she put it later, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1074.5600000000002s)]
*  something of utter shallowness. Arendt took issue with the persecution story that the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1079.1200000000001s)]
*  Jews were the victims of, as she put it, a historical principle stretching from pharaoh [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1084.48s)]
*  to Haman, the victim of a metaphysical principle. In other words, the lesson of the Holocaust [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1089.68s)]
*  was not that Germans are uniquely evil, nor that Jews are uniquely vulnerable to atrocities being [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1096.72s)]
*  committed against them. The lesson of the Holocaust was that human nature, being human nature, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1106.24s)]
*  can lead groups of people, if they feel sufficiently threatened or scared or persuaded [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1112.48s)]
*  by their tribe, to hate another group of people so much that they dehumanize them to the point that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1118.56s)]
*  they have no trouble treating them like subhumans, like just extinguishing their lives without value. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1125.52s)]
*  And that the lessons of the Holocaust were universal and humanitarian, and not about one [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1133.52s)]
*  group of people victimizing another. And it wasn't just Arendt who emphasized the universality of the [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1140.08s)]
*  lesson of the Holocaust, it was also the judges and the prosecutors of the Nuremberg trial. The [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1147.36s)]
*  Nuremberg trial was an incredible event. The Americans, when they defeated Nazi Germany, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1152.32s)]
*  with the immense help of the Soviet Union, captured a lot of Nazi work criminals, and they could have [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1159.6799999999998s)]
*  just executed them all on the spot. That's often what was done in war, but they decided instead to [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1168.4s)]
*  hold a trial that the world could watch. In part so that these inevitable executions would have a [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1178.0s)]
*  legal justification to them. I mean, these were not fair courts, they were going to result in [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  convictions. This was a form of victor's justice, but still putting a legal process on it [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1192.0s)]
*  elevated it and made it more civilized. Unlike, say, the way that the United States decided to [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1198.16s)]
*  kill instead of capture and try Osama bin Laden, the Americans after World War II decided to capture [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1202.24s)]
*  and try the Nazi work criminals who were responsible for the Holocaust. But they also did it because [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1208.08s)]
*  they wanted to present the evidence of the Holocaust to the world, knowing that otherwise [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1214.8s)]
*  there'd be a lot of people who denied the Holocaust, who doubted the Holocaust. Of course, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1219.36s)]
*  to this day there still are people who doubt it despite the abundance of evidence offered up to [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1222.56s)]
*  trial and elsewhere proving it. But what they really wanted to do above all else was to create [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1227.12s)]
*  universal principles going forward that applied to all countries, not just to Germany, that would [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1233.36s)]
*  govern and limit their conduct in future wars because what they had seen from World War II was [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1240.08s)]
*  not that Germans were capable of evil, but that human beings were. And they constantly emphasized [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1246.32s)]
*  the Nuremberg trial judges and prosecutors did that the Nuremberg trial would only be valid, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  would only make sense, would only have purpose and value if the principles it established [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1259.2s)]
*  applied to every nation going forward. Here is what the lead prosecutor, the American lawyer [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1268.08s)]
*  Robert Jackson, he had previously served in the US Justice Department and became the lead prosecutor [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1274.0s)]
*  at the Nuremberg trial said in his opening statement, quote, What makes this inquest significant [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1280.48s)]
*  is that these prisoners, these Nazis, represent sinister influences that will lurk in the world [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  long after their bodies have returned to dust. We will show them to be living symbols of racial [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1294.08s)]
*  hatreds, of terrorism and violence and of the arrogance and cruelty of power. They are symbols [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1300.88s)]
*  of fierce nationalisms and of militarisms. And let me make clear that while this law is first [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1307.28s)]
*  applied against German aggressors, the law includes and if it is to serve a useful purpose, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1314.56s)]
*  it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1320.48s)]
*  We are able to do away with domestic tyranny and violence and aggression by those in power against [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1327.68s)]
*  the rights of their people only when we make all men, all men answerable to the law. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1331.6s)]
*  This trial represents mankind's desperate effort to apply the discipline of the law to statesmen who [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1338.32s)]
*  have used their powers of state to attack the foundations of the world's peace and to commit [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1343.36s)]
*  aggressions against the rights of their neighbors. Does any of that sound like Israel was intended to [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1348.8s)]
*  be immunized or excluded from lessons being drawn about the Holocaust or that somehow [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1357.36s)]
*  a state of the Jews was somehow immune from the worst temptations of human nature? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1366.56s)]
*  The exact opposite was true. They repeated that over and over. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1374.0s)]
*  And so you can dispute whether or not this comparison is appropriate on the facts, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1377.3600000000001s)]
*  but to claim that any invocation of the Holocaust as a way of criticizing the government of Israel's [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1385.2s)]
*  behavior is inherently inappropriate or anti-Semitic or Holocaust denialism is [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1390.4s)]
*  deceit of the highest order. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jonZ3r_bbNQ&t=1398.48s)]
