# Free Speech Frauds: Gov. Greg Abbott and the Pro-Israel Right
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ)
*  Now, speaking of liars who are massive censorship advocates, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=0.0s)]
*  we have documented many times before, is one of the most egregious and aggressive censors [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to trying to silence Israel critics in the United States. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=23.92s)]
*  He was someone who sponsored one of those bills that made it a prerequisite to having [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=27.76s)]
*  a contract with Texas to certify that you vowed never to support a boycott of Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=32.64s)]
*  Otherwise, you will lose your job as a contractor in Texas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=40.92s)]
*  You're free to boycott any other country in the world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=45.0s)]
*  You're even free to boycott other American states. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=47.28s)]
*  You can boycott North Carolina or Indiana if you don't like their trans bill. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=52.5s)]
*  You can boycott New York if you don't like their abortion bill. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=55.68s)]
*  You're free to boycott anybody, just not Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=58.68s)]
*  And multiple red states adopted a direct attack on free speech of that kind only for it to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=62.6s)]
*  be ruled repeatedly unconstitutional by the federal courts. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=68.84s)]
*  And now Greg Abbott is back. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=73.44s)]
*  And before we get to what Greg Abbott is doing, let's look at Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  He went on Fox News, which has been a celebratory frenzy for months about the virtues of campus [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=80.56s)]
*  censorship in order to protect Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=90.64s)]
*  And here's what he said about the students who are walking out in protest. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  You see them peacefully assembled there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=96.68s)]
*  This is what Tom Cotton, self-proclaimed free speech champion, had to say. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=98.2s)]
*  If Eric Adams won't send the NYPD to protect these Jewish students, if Kathy Hilkel won't [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=103.0s)]
*  send the National Guard, Joe Biden has a duty to protect these Jewish students from what [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=109.28s)]
*  is a nascent pogrom on these campuses. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=113.96s)]
*  These are scenes like you've seen out of the 1930s in Germany. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=116.8s)]
*  They should never be witnessed or tolerated here in America in 2024. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  To equate what is going on in American campuses where people of every different background, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=125.96s)]
*  including Jewish students, are linking arms to protest an American-backed war, to compare [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=134.92s)]
*  that to the pogroms of Nazi Germany and to the Holocaust, and is so sick and deeply offensive. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=142.28s)]
*  But that shows you the desperation, the masters who they serve, that they are willing to say [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=153.64s)]
*  anything and do anything in order to abridge the free speech rights of Americans. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=160.0s)]
*  Notice they don't care at all if Americans say the most vicious things about the United [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  States government and its leaders. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=172.52s)]
*  You can say Joe Biden is a corrupt communist and his brain is melting, and the United States [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=175.12s)]
*  government is just oligarchy that is in bed with the CCP. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=180.24s)]
*  You can say whatever you want about American leaders, about the United States government, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=187.36s)]
*  and nobody's going to care. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=192.56s)]
*  What you cannot do unless you want to, if you don't want to be targeted with censorship [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=193.68s)]
*  demands by the Tom Cottons and Greg Abbott and Mike Johnson of the world, is you can't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=198.84s)]
*  criticize Israel, the foreign country of Israel, and its leaders and its government. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=204.52s)]
*  Otherwise, they'll immediately start screaming racist, like they've been doing, demanding [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  that the administrators, the school administrators and the deans come in and stop these students, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=216.8s)]
*  and failing that, they will call the police on them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, here is Greg Abbott. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=228.4s)]
*  There was a protest at the University of Texas, Austin, which is a public school where it's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  even more difficult to restrict the range of free speech that can be tolerated. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=240.36s)]
*  This is what Governor Abbott said after the police were called and the National Guard [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=245.92s)]
*  was deployed against these peacefully organized protesters. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=250.28s)]
*  He said the following, quote, arrest are being made right now and will continue until the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  crowd disperses. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=264.12s)]
*  These protesters belong in jail. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=267.12s)]
*  Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in Texas, period. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=271.68s)]
*  Students joining in hate-filled anti-Semitic protests at any public college or university [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=277.76s)]
*  in Texas should be expelled. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=282.32s)]
*  Isn't this what the Republican Party and the American right have been viciously mocking [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=287.0s)]
*  for the last decade? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=291.32s)]
*  The idea that if you express a view about trans people or black people or Muslims or [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=293.64s)]
*  immigrants or women on college campuses that some functionary or official somewhere deems [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=298.2s)]
*  to be hateful, sufficiently hateful, or likely to incite violence against that group, that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=305.96s)]
*  you should be punished and arrested, this is exactly what has been denounced and mocked [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=312.68s)]
*  this idea. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=317.96s)]
*  He's saying that what these protesters are guilty of is anti-Semitism expressing hateful [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=318.96s)]
*  views. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  That is protected political speech in the United States. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=327.72s)]
*  This is such an obvious assault on First Amendment free speech rights every bit as much as that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=330.44000000000005s)]
*  law that I referenced earlier that he championed for so long until a court struck it down. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=335.48s)]
*  Here by the way, on June 9th, 2019, is the same Governor Abbott who frequently visits [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=341.56s)]
*  Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  He worships Israel for his own religious and cultural reasons. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=349.36s)]
*  And here is what he said about that law that he championed. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=354.6s)]
*  Some colleges are banning free speech on college campuses. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=359.88s)]
*  Well, no more because I'm about to sign a law that protects free speech on college campuses [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=364.72s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=373.04s)]
*  Look at this free speech champion. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=374.04s)]
*  He's signing a free speech law. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=378.68s)]
*  Shouldn't have to do it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=381.04s)]
*  First Amendment guarantees it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=382.36s)]
*  Now it's law in Texas. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=383.96s)]
*  Hypocrisy this nauseating and glaring and sickening is rarely seen. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=388.28s)]
*  He has been pitching himself as a free speech champion. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  He said, I'm going to sign in my office right now a law that bars censorship on American [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=401.28s)]
*  college campuses. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=408.84s)]
*  The first amendment and then he turned around this week and said, people who protest against [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=410.52s)]
*  the Israeli war in Gaza and who are guilty of hate speech should be arrested. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=415.08s)]
*  And he called the National Guard on them. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=421.08s)]
*  Now the University of Texas itself pursuant to this free speech movement in Texas, at [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=424.56s)]
*  least this very selective free speech movement, announced a policy in October of 2023. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=432.79999999999995s)]
*  Where they made very clear that because they are a public school, the public has every [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  right to come onto their campus and to protest and to march, not just students, but everyone [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=444.85999999999996s)]
*  from the outside as well because it's public space. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=453.52s)]
*  They publicly financed academic institution. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=455.88s)]
*  The University of Texas is not a private school like Columbia or Harvard. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=459.32s)]
*  Here is what the University of Texas announced as part of what it called, quote, free speech [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=464.68s)]
*  week. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=468.8s)]
*  Why can members of the public come to campus at any time and engage in demonstrations and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=473.32s)]
*  speeches? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=479.2s)]
*  So state law in Texas actually allows members of the public, just like our university community, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=480.52s)]
*  to come onto campus and use our common outdoor areas for speech activity. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=487.08s)]
*  I think that surprises a lot of students. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  They show up here and they think, who is this random stranger setting up a table talking [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  about a thing I find upsetting? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=499.18s)]
*  But that's protected by state law and members of the public, just like university community, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=501.36s)]
*  can use our common outdoor areas. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=506.56s)]
*  Now it isn't a free for all. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  So when you say, why can they come at any time, there's some nuance there. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=510.16s)]
*  It's subject to our university rules that are permitted under the law. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=516.2s)]
*  So we can put in place time, place, and manner restrictions that are really all about making [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=520.56s)]
*  sure those are content neutral so we can't have rules that say, well, you can't come [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=527.16s)]
*  to campus and talk about this or that subject or express this or that view. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=531.8399999999999s)]
*  But we can have rules about where you can set up tables, for example. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=536.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, this was just six months ago. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=539.7199999999999s)]
*  But officials of the University of Texas, as part of Greg Abbott's steadfast, stalwart, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=542.4s)]
*  principled, regularly individualistic defense of constitutional freedoms, raised the banner [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=547.88s)]
*  of free speech and said, everybody is welcome at the University of Texas, student and citizen [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=553.96s)]
*  alike, in order to protest and express whatever views they want. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=560.6s)]
*  That's the nature of the United States. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=564.72s)]
*  But like so many Republicans, so many conservatives, he has a gigantic Israel exception to every [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=567.84s)]
*  professed view that he has. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=575.72s)]
*  Now, I've been reporting on the amazing enactment of these laws that condition employment with [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=577.72s)]
*  states on what basically is a loyalty oath to Israel for years. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=585.72s)]
*  Back in 2018, I wrote this article. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=592.0s)]
*  It was an extraordinary story where a woman who had worked for the Austin, Texas school [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=594.5s)]
*  district for years as a celebrated speech pathologist, she had an expertise in working [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=601.64s)]
*  with young students who had speech deficiencies and speech impediments, especially ones whose [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  families come from certain countries. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=615.72s)]
*  And she would be contracted every year by the school district to work with those students. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=618.52s)]
*  And she had amazing success, nothing but rave reviews. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  And every year she got a new contract and she signed it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=627.12s)]
*  In April 2018, when pursuant to Texas law, her contract had an addendum that it never [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=630.8s)]
*  previously had that she was required to sign, which contained a vow that she would never [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  support and does not support a boycott of Israel. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=644.18s)]
*  The problem for her is that she does support a boycott of Israel. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=649.3599999999999s)]
*  Her household chooses not to purchase goods from Israel as a way of supporting the effort [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=652.24s)]
*  to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, which is perfectly within her rights [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=658.36s)]
*  as an American citizen to do. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=664.48s)]
*  And as a result, she lost her job. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=666.6s)]
*  And this was a bill that was enacted in multiple red states to ban criticism of foreign country [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=670.16s)]
*  by American citizens in the United States to the point where they would lose their job [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=676.4s)]
*  if they refused. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=680.04s)]
*  Here is Greg Abbott the year before in 2017 when he first signed this flagrantly unconstitutional [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=684.28s)]
*  law into effect. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=691.6s)]
*  And here's what he said as he stood, as he sat rather, with a bunch of Republican sponsors [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=694.0s)]
*  of this Israel protecting free speech abridgment behind him. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=700.32s)]
*  Between Israel, between the United States, as well as the state of Texas. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  Israel is one of Texas' largest trading partners. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  And then of course there is the issue about the essential international ally that Israel [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=715.48s)]
*  plays for both the United States and the state of Texas. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=722.88s)]
*  As a result, any anti-Israel policy is an anti-Texas policy. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=727.88s)]
*  An anti-Israel policy is an anti-Texan policy, pronounced the Republican governor and free [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=742.4s)]
*  speech champion. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=748.52s)]
*  You can criticize any other country you want. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=751.0s)]
*  You can attack your own fellow citizens and their states and boycott them all you want. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=753.86s)]
*  But somehow to be a good Texan, one eligible for jobs in Texas, that requires full-scale [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=760.88s)]
*  support for Israel and its foreign government. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the kind of insane extremism that has permeated Republican politics for a long [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  time. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=782.0400000000001s)]
*  The Democrats are equally enthralled to Israel for different reasons. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=784.28s)]
*  Obviously the very powerful pro-Israel lobby is a major part for each. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=788.84s)]
*  And there are a lot of Democrats who have all kinds of loyalties to Israel for their [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=795.32s)]
*  own religious and cultural reasons. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=798.96s)]
*  But a big reason why it's so predominant in the Republican party is because Greg Abbott, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=800.44s)]
*  people like him, have a very strong religious belief that not just Israel but the Jewish [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=806.44s)]
*  people are chosen by God and they speak of this openly. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=811.6s)]
*  And they have every right to that religious view. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=816.96s)]
*  What they don't have is the right to impose that view on others through this series of [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=819.4s)]
*  censorship laws designed to abridge the free speech rights of Americans in the name of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=824.34s)]
*  shielding from criticism this foreign country that they worship. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEk2xfk7tQ&t=829.5s)]
