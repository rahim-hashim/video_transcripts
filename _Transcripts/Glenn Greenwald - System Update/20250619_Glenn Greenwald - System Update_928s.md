# Ted Cruz's PATHETIC Antisemitism Accusations Against Tucker
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA)
*  I just want to show you this last extremely revealing clip between Ted Cruz and Tucker [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=0.0s)]
*  Carlson where things got particularly heated, Ted Cruz got particularly uncomfortable, and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=11.36s)]
*  you'll never ever guess, never in a million years, even if I give you a hundred guesses, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=14.88s)]
*  what Ted Cruz decided to imply was truly motivating Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=19.92s)]
*  Do you think that, it's just interesting because what you're now describing in a very defensive [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=25.2s)]
*  way I will say is foreign influence over our politics. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=30.16s)]
*  No. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=33.76s)]
*  And you began, and it's so transparently obvious to everybody, I don't know why you would be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=34.76s)]
*  embarrassed of it, you said that you are sincerely for Israel, I believe you, I don't think you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=38.84s)]
*  have some weird agenda, you seem to be sincere. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=42.04s)]
*  By the way, Tucker, it's a very weird thing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=44.84s)]
*  The obsession with Israel, we're talking about foreign countries. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  It's hardly an obsession. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=52.36s)]
*  You're not talking about Chinese, you're not talking about Japanese, you're not talking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=53.36s)]
*  about the Brits, you're not talking about the French, the question, what about the Jews? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=55.92s)]
*  What about the Jews? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=58.8s)]
*  Oh, I'm an anti-Semite now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=59.8s)]
*  Senator, you're just... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=61.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=62.68s)]
*  I just want to, do you remember the clip we just showed you where Ted Cruz said that he [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=63.68s)]
*  went to the US Congress with the stated intention of working, quote, every day to advance and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=70.08s)]
*  serve the interest of Israel, a foreign country? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=77.32s)]
*  And then that very same Ted Cruz announcing that what Barry Weiss does, if they're honest, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=80.92s)]
*  what Ben Shapiro does, if he's honest, what Chuck Schumer does, and he has been honest, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=87.8s)]
*  is that their supreme cause, their primary loyalty is advancing the interest of a foreign [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=92.8s)]
*  government even though they're American citizens and in this case, American politicians. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Ted Cruz just minutes ago, that was just like in this clip, we separated the clips, but [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=104.12s)]
*  just a couple minutes earlier, he's the one who said that he works up every single day [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=108.44s)]
*  to serve the interest of Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=115.44s)]
*  Every day he said that's what he does. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  And the reason why so many of us who don't do that talk about Israel a lot is because [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=118.92s)]
*  Israel's the country, we give more money in foreign aid to over many decades by far than [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=122.24s)]
*  any other group, we fund their military, we go to war for them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=126.64s)]
*  The reason, as General said, we're so hated in the Middle East and that people from the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=130.48s)]
*  Middle East want to attack our country in large part is because they know that we're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=136.0s)]
*  the ones who provide Israel with all the weapons that bomb their countries and blow up babies [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=139.64s)]
*  and kill Arabs and Muslims all the time and have done so for decades. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=146.0s)]
*  They know the United States is behind that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=149.82s)]
*  We pay an enormous price financially, militarily, in lives and soft power and reputation, in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=151.72s)]
*  terms of our own physical security, for dedicating ourselves to the state of Israel for all the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=158.72s)]
*  reasons we've been showing you people in the government admit they do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=165.24s)]
*  We've been arming and financing their destruction of Gaza. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  What human rights groups all over the world, what I agree as well, will say is the worst [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  crime by far in the 21st century, the worst atrocity, the worst, we're talking about forced [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=178.86s)]
*  starvation, all the other things that we've documented. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=184.4s)]
*  The US government has been right at the heart of that first under Biden, now under Trump. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=186.96s)]
*  changes with foreign policy when you vote for one party or the other, even though Trump [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=191.24s)]
*  promised a major break from bipartisan foreign policy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  That's why we talk about Israel, because the Ted Cruz's and Chuck Schumer's and so many [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=200.44s)]
*  others have made it the centerpiece of our foreign policy and of our country to the point [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  where we now have civil liberties attacks, attacks on free speech in the name of this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  foreign government. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=216.56s)]
*  People getting deported and expelled for the crime of criticizing the state of Israel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=218.2s)]
*  Hate speech codes being imposed to prevent you from saying things about Israel or particular [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=223.6s)]
*  Jewish people, what you can say about anybody else, including American citizens or the United [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=227.76s)]
*  States. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  It's infected and contaminated every last aspect of our political life and so Ted Cruz, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  who says that he wakes up every day to serve the interest of Israel, this one foreign government, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=238.16s)]
*  can then turn around to Tucker and say, why are you obsessed with Israel? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=242.66s)]
*  It must be because you're an anti-Semite. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  That's the nature of this discourse always. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=247.04s)]
*  Conservatives went around for a decade whining, complaining, screaming. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=250.88s)]
*  And I was with them a lot on these grievances. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=256.2s)]
*  The minute you disagree with a liberal on anything, they call you a racist or a misogynist [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=259.12s)]
*  or a transfoot, whatever. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=262.88s)]
*  You question liberal dogma and you get accused of being a bigot. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=264.24s)]
*  That's exactly how most pro-Israel advocates function. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=267.28s)]
*  The minute you question them, the minute you criticize Israel, you're instantly branded [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=271.44s)]
*  Exactly the same tactic they pretend to loathe when it's done to them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=275.68s)]
*  Here's how this played out. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=279.88s)]
*  You're not talking about the Brits. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=280.88s)]
*  You're not talking about the French. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=282.48s)]
*  The question, what about the Jews? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=283.48s)]
*  What about the Jews? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=284.48s)]
*  Oh, I'm an anti-Semite now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=285.48s)]
*  Senator, you're asking the question, Tucker. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=286.48s)]
*  You're asking why are the Jews controlling our foreign policy? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=289.88s)]
*  That's what you just asked. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  I am hardly saying that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  And I have... [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=295.44s)]
*  That is exactly what you just said. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=296.44s)]
*  Well, actually, I can speak for myself and tell you what I am saying. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=297.44s)]
*  On behalf not simply of myself, but of my many Jewish friends who would have the same [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=300.56s)]
*  questions, which is to what extent... [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=304.44s)]
*  It's interesting you're trying to derail my questions by calling me an anti-Semite, which [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=307.24s)]
*  you are. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=309.96s)]
*  I did not. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=310.96s)]
*  Of course you are. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=311.96s)]
*  And rather than be honorable enough to say it right to my face, you are in a sleazy, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=312.96s)]
*  feline way implying it or just asking questions about the Jews. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=317.28s)]
*  I'm not asking questions about the Jews. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=320.12s)]
*  I have... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=322.44s)]
*  This has nothing to do with Jews or Judaism. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=323.44s)]
*  It has to do with the foreign government. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=325.08s)]
*  Isn't Israel controlling our foreign policy? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=326.64s)]
*  That's not about the Jews. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=328.72s)]
*  You said... [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=329.72s)]
*  I'm asking... [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=330.72s)]
*  And by the way, you're the one that just called me, I think, a sleazy feline. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=331.72s)]
*  So let's be clear. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=333.84s)]
*  It's sleazy to imply that I'm an anti-Semite, which you just did. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=334.84s)]
*  No, I just said why is that the only question you're asking? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=338.24s)]
*  You answer it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=340.84s)]
*  Give me another reason. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=341.84s)]
*  If you're not an anti-Semite, give me another reason why the obsession is Israel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=342.84s)]
*  I am in no sense obsessed with Israel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=346.64s)]
*  We are on the brink of war with Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  And so these are valid questions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=350.68s)]
*  But you're not asking about Iran or the ISIL. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=352.08s)]
*  You just... [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  If I can finish, you asked me why I'm obsessed with Israel three minutes after telling me [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  that when you first ran for Congress, you elucidated one of your main goals, which is [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=361.52s)]
*  to defend Israel. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  And I'm the one who's obsessed with Israel. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't see a lawmaker's job as defending the interests of a foreign government, period. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  Any government, including the ones that my ancestors come from. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  So that's my position. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  That does not make me an anti-Semite. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  And shame on you for suggesting otherwise. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  And I mean that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=381.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, this is the one thing that I really hate more than anything, is this kind of cowardice [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  in discourse. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=387.2s)]
*  If you want to call someone an anti-Semite, just call them that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=388.88s)]
*  Say, I know that you hate Jews. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=392.56s)]
*  I believe that you hate Jews. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=394.08s)]
*  I believe that you're operating from bigotry. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=395.08s)]
*  The reason you're questioning my loyalty to Israel is because you think, in reality, that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  the job of a U.S. politician is to serve the interests of the American people rather than [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=402.84s)]
*  a foreign government is because you hate Israel. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=406.76s)]
*  You hate Jews. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=408.76s)]
*  You are anti-Semite. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=409.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=410.76s)]
*  At least if you say that, people will see what you're doing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=411.76s)]
*  But they very rarely do that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=415.96s)]
*  People online will do that because who cares? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=418.16s)]
*  They say anything, often anonymously. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=420.16s)]
*  But obviously he was implying very strongly using innuendo and insinuation. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=423.16s)]
*  But the reason Tucker Carlson is questioning AIPAC, questioning the loyalty that Ted Cruz [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  said he has to Israel and the propriety of that, the necessity of going to war for Israel [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=436.64s)]
*  and Iran, fighting alongside them against their worst enemy, he's insinuating and implying [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=441.24s)]
*  that it's because Tucker Carlson is an anti-Semite who is obsessed with Jews. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=446.76000000000005s)]
*  But then when Tucker Carlson says you're calling me an anti-Semite, I didn't say that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=450.76000000000005s)]
*  Just asking you, why are you so obsessed with Jews? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=455.88000000000005s)]
*  Of course he was saying that, but he's such a coward. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  I hate it when people use insinuation and innuendo to accuse somebody else of bigotry [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  and then give themselves plausible deniability. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=468.24s)]
*  I didn't say that you hate Jews. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=470.12s)]
*  Why are you so sensitive? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=471.36s)]
*  But of course that's exactly what he was implying. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=472.36s)]
*  And this is the way the discussion always ends up. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=474.20000000000005s)]
*  You can watch your government, send billions of your dollars as you do every year to this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=477.16s)]
*  foreign government. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=482.76s)]
*  You can watch your own government be filled with politicians who you elected to serve [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=483.76s)]
*  your interests. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=488.4s)]
*  Admit that their primary responsibility, whether it's because God tells them to or whatever [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=489.4s)]
*  other reason they might have is to serve the interests of a foreign government that Ted [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=493.56s)]
*  Cruz says he wakes up every day to fulfill. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=496.32s)]
*  And the minute you ask a question, I'm like, wait a minute, why are we doing so much for [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=499.28s)]
*  this foreign government? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=501.88s)]
*  Why don't we send all our money there? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=502.88s)]
*  Why don't we give them all our arms? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=504.44s)]
*  Why do we fight all their wars for them? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=505.44s)]
*  Why do we sacrifice our interests for them? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=506.44s)]
*  The ending of that discussion is you are an anti-Semite. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=509.08s)]
*  The last time any president meaningfully defied the orders of the Israeli government in Vapec, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=513.54s)]
*  Ronald Reagan did it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=520.68s)]
*  There's a memo of his saying when Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in the 1980s, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=522.16s)]
*  was bombing southern Lebanon and killing huge numbers of civilians, massacring civilians, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=528.8s)]
*  Reagan called him up and said, this is disgusting what you're doing. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=535.56s)]
*  It's like a holocaust and I demand that it end. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=538.04s)]
*  And 20 minutes later Menachem Begin called him back and said, we're stopping the war. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=540.76s)]
*  Reagan stood up to Israel all the time. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=545.0s)]
*  But the real conflict became when George H.W. Bush was president, people like James Baker [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=548.12s)]
*  and Brent Scowcroft who were in the realist school, like John Mearsheimer of foreign policy [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  were his secretary of state and national secret advisor. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=557.3s)]
*  And then a very simple view, which was it's in the interest of the United States to foster [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  an agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians that would create a two-state [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=564.7800000000001s)]
*  solution where a Palestinian state exists, coexists side by side with an Israeli state [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=567.5s)]
*  because that will finally end this endless, very vitriolic conflict that prevents the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=572.0600000000001s)]
*  United States from doing business in the Middle East because everybody in the Middle East [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=578.38s)]
*  blames the United States, rightfully so, for the repression of the Palestinians. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  And so the United States government across partisan lines for decades had the view, our [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=584.5400000000001s)]
*  interest is that you have a two-state solution. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=588.38s)]
*  And the anger of the Bush 41 government was, we keep telling you we don't want you to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=590.38s)]
*  expand more settlements in the West Bank because the West Bank doesn't belong to you. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=597.74s)]
*  The West Bank is going to be part of the Palestinian state and the deal we're trying to foster. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=602.22s)]
*  And when you allow your citizens to expand their settlements in a part of the area that [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=607.34s)]
*  doesn't belong to you, it makes a two-state solution more difficult. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=613.34s)]
*  And no matter how much we keep telling you that it undermines our interests, you keep [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=616.46s)]
*  doing it anyway. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=619.18s)]
*  And if you keep doing things that we're telling you undermines our interests, we're not going [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=620.6999999999999s)]
*  to keep funding you. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=623.8199999999999s)]
*  We're not going to give you loan guarantees that you need. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=624.62s)]
*  And that threat from the Bush administration saying if you don't stop these policies that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=628.4599999999999s)]
*  hurt us, we're not going to keep giving you loan guarantees caused a major explosion on [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=634.14s)]
*  a bipartisan basis in Congress from the Ted Cruz's and the Apex and the Schumers who say [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=639.66s)]
*  our number one job is to serve Israel. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=645.9s)]
*  And there was a major scandal accusing Jim Baker and Brent Scowcroft of being anti-Semites. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=649.02s)]
*  And you know who led that campaign? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=655.5s)]
*  Bill Clinton and the Democrats. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=658.06s)]
*  When Bill Clinton ran as a Democratic nominee against the sitting incumbent president in [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=659.18s)]
*  1992, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton ran around the United States accusing Bush 41 and James [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=664.22s)]
*  Baker and Brent Scowcroft of spawning anti-Semitism, of encouraging violent attacks against Jews [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=672.06s)]
*  because they were questioning the state of Israel, being insufficiently supported to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=680.2199999999999s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=683.26s)]
*  Jim Baker got smeared in headlines all over the country. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=684.14s)]
*  And he was a very respected foreign policy advisor, lawyer. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=688.8599999999999s)]
*  It basically destroyed his reputation overnight. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=691.9s)]
*  They just branded him an anti-Semite. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=693.8199999999999s)]
*  And ever since then, that was 1991. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=695.8199999999999s)]
*  Thanks to Bill Clinton and the Democrats and plenty of people in the both parties and the media. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=699.02s)]
*  Everybody understood from that point forward, if you even question why we do so much for [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=705.26s)]
*  Israel, even when it harms our interests, your reputation will be destroyed. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=709.34s)]
*  You'll be branded an anti-Semite. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=712.3s)]
*  And that put an end to any real attempt by any president to defy Israel. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=713.58s)]
*  To his credit, Obama entered the Iran deal over Netanyahu's vicious objections, did a [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=717.74s)]
*  couple of other things as well. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=724.0600000000001s)]
*  But he also signed a deal on his way out, promulgated the deal. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=725.02s)]
*  Promising $4 billion a year to Israel with Netanyahu. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=728.3s)]
*  And so this always has been what has destroyed American stability, the question of this, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=733.42s)]
*  calling people an anti-Semite. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=738.4599999999999s)]
*  You just saw Ted Cruz do it, the most cowardly, slamming way possible to talk to Carlson. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=739.66s)]
*  And I think finally, and this is the one note of optimism on which I will end, is that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=744.78s)]
*  people are tired of that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=751.66s)]
*  They got tired of the liberal tactic, just running around calling everybody anti-Semite [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=753.18s)]
*  all the time, calling everybody a racist all the time, rather calling them a misogynist. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=757.42s)]
*  Everybody understood that the more you just throw that term around, the less impact it [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  has, the less meaning it has. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=765.8199999999999s)]
*  And so it wore off, and there was backlash against it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=769.18s)]
*  Like, go ahead, call me a racist, call me a misogynist. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=772.78s)]
*  You've drained those terms of meaning. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=775.9s)]
*  They're just weapons, cynical weapons that you employ to end debate and prevent questions [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=777.8199999999999s)]
*  about your views. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=783.3399999999999s)]
*  And that is 100% done, even more so, from pro-Israel conservatives or pro-Israel [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=785.02s)]
*  Democrats to end any questioning about the state of Israel and our loyalty to it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=791.66s)]
*  And I think people are at the point with the independent media watching Israel blow up [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=795.74s)]
*  babies every single day and commit atrocities with our weapons in our arms in Gaza, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=799.18s)]
*  of being told we can't talk, we have to lose our jobs, we have to submit to heightened [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=804.54s)]
*  hate speech laws and codes on college campuses. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=809.1s)]
*  People get fired from college campuses. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=811.74s)]
*  If they question this foreign government, people are like, wait a minute, why is this [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=814.14s)]
*  foreign government dominating our country so much? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=816.38s)]
*  And people aren't scared anymore of being called an anti-Semite. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=819.9s)]
*  And that's why Tucker Carlson was able to go and do what he did with Ted Cruz. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=823.74s)]
*  I don't believe Tucker Carlson could ever would have done that when he was at Fox. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=827.5s)]
*  The fact that Tucker himself is not Jewish makes it more vulnerable to that accusation, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=831.9s)]
*  but by no means does being Jewish shield you from it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=835.66s)]
*  I can guarantee you that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=838.86s)]
*  And it used to be that being branded that was career destroying. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=840.62s)]
*  It no longer is. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=843.74s)]
*  And that has opened up for the first time these kinds of questioning, these kinds of debates. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=845.5s)]
*  And when you finally open it up and shine sunshine on it, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=851.9s)]
*  that's when you finally start to see the truth. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=856.3s)]
*  That's when things start to, all the mold and dirt and things hidden beneath the floorboards [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=858.14s)]
*  can finally be detected and washed away. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=862.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think polls show clearly that that's what's happening with [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HW-ga6XzA&t=865.1s)]
