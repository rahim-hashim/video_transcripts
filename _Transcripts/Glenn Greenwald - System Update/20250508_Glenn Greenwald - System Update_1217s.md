# Christopher Rufo Claims Academic Freedom is a NEW Invention
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc)
*  The interesting thing about the founders when it comes to one of the topics on which you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=0.0s)]
*  most focus, which is the role, what academic institutions are supposed to be, what university [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=9.52s)]
*  are supposed to be, is that several of the key founders actually founded or were part [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=14.88s)]
*  of the founding of educational institutions, Benjamin Franklin in Pennsylvania, Thomas [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=20.44s)]
*  Jefferson at the University of Virginia. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  And when Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia, he wrote a letter to William [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=26.94s)]
*  Roscoe, this was in 1820, and he said, this institution, the University of Virginia, will [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=34.38s)]
*  be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind, for here we are not afraid to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  free to combat it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=53.06s)]
*  Which is basically meaning, you know, academia is the one place, and there's a lot of Enlightenment [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=54.06s)]
*  thinkers who said the same, where we have to be even more aggressive about ensuring [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  that our debates are unlimited. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=64.02000000000001s)]
*  You can question any orthodoxy, you can express any view that might offend people gravely, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=67.06s)]
*  you can even be wrong about things, where the solution is just to make sure that discourse [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=72.6s)]
*  is always free from government interference, from outside interference, or even from internal [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=76.88s)]
*  administrative interference, that the idea of an academic institution is full academic [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=82.18s)]
*  freedom and unlimited free discourse. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=87.72000000000001s)]
*  Is that a view of academic institutions, expressed there by Jefferson, that you share? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=90.9s)]
*  No, that's actually not even Jefferson's view. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=96.22000000000001s)]
*  And so he's talking in a kind of philosophical and speculative way about the illimitable [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=100.4s)]
*  freedom of the human mind. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  But if you actually read his Rockfish Gap Report, which is the charter document of the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=107.32s)]
*  University of Virginia, part of his legacy of which he was most proud, he writes that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  the university should be, quote, at all times and in all things subject to the control of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=119.0s)]
*  the legislature. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  And what he means by that is that this is a public institution, and the highest authority [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=126.46s)]
*  of that institution was the legislature, which chartered it, funded it, and guided it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=130.82s)]
*  This doesn't mean that the legislature should micromanage in every case or have too much [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=136.76s)]
*  of an influence if things are going well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  But the point was, if the university were to get out of hand, if it were to lose balance, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=143.88s)]
*  if it were to compromise the pursuit of truth, Jefferson knew that in a republic, the people [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=149.48s)]
*  are the ultimate authorities. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=156.06s)]
*  And he wanted to make clear at that very initial point that the legislature had control over [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=158.14s)]
*  reforming the institution. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=163.68s)]
*  And when that institution had violated its core commitments, the legislature had unlimited [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=165.8s)]
*  authority to bring its power to bear, to actually reorient, reform, and really restore the purpose [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=171.44s)]
*  of those institutions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=180.36s)]
*  And my argument this whole time is that this is exactly where we are now, and that because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=181.36s)]
*  the universities have been so deeply corrupted, and this has been documented from the closing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  of the American mind, or even before that from William F. Buckley, God and Man at Yale, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=193.48s)]
*  all the way to what I've tried to document in my book, that it's time now for the people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  to exercise their proper authority. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=204.12s)]
*  And so Jefferson's own political sense was right, because he was balancing on the one [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=206.56s)]
*  hand the kind of spirit of inquiry of the mind, but he was bringing also to bear an [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  administrative power, an arrangement that would correct this excesses of what could [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=220.04s)]
*  be an ideological capture or a failure of administration in universities. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=227.0s)]
*  And I still think that that's important. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  To the extent that we can have universities function successfully autonomously, we should [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  grant them that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  But to the extent that they can't do so, the Constitution, and as well as the work of Jefferson [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=241.1s)]
*  in the early 19th century, shows us the way it's time to use that power that has really [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=249.6s)]
*  been abandoned and dormant for too long. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=254.36s)]
*  Well, I want to get to this private public distinction that you're drawing, because a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=257.36s)]
*  lot of the universities that we have that are most influential, that are now the primary [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=262.52s)]
*  targets of the Trump administration, are not actually public schools in the sense that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=268.48s)]
*  they're a state school. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=274.88s)]
*  They're run by the government. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=276.16s)]
*  They do get funding for research projects that the US government thinks is in the national [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=277.68s)]
*  interest in order to pursue, but they're not actually private, they're actually public [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=282.16s)]
*  schools. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=286.36s)]
*  But let's leave that to the side for a moment. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=287.36s)]
*  And even with regard to what you just said, that you're attributing to Jefferson's view, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=290.0s)]
*  and it's too difficult to debate that or to speak that, but so I'm going to ask you, when [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=295.44s)]
*  you say that ultimately in a republic it's the people who have to decide how institutions [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=301.86s)]
*  function, presumably you mean public institutions or state universities, would that mean that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=308.86s)]
*  for example if a significant majority of the population were very passionately convinced [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=316.86s)]
*  about a particular view, so much so that they thought it should be prohibited essentially [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=324.66s)]
*  to even question or challenge it, that Jefferson's idea of an academic institution or yours is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  that once there's enough public support for a particular view that it would be legitimate [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=338.18s)]
*  to basically ban the university from permitting or allowing any challenge or questioning of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=342.5s)]
*  it? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=348.82s)]
*  Well, there's a couple different ways to tackle that question. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=350.5s)]
*  I mean, obviously the context now is the Constitution of the United States, and so that provides [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=353.7s)]
*  some guardrails and some limitations, of course, on the government. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=360.02s)]
*  But let's break down that question I think in a way that makes it tangible, that makes [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=365.7s)]
*  it operational. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=369.82s)]
*  If the people decide that let's say a university has a department of phrenology or whatever, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=372.82s)]
*  witchcraft, and then the people decide, hey, we don't want to actually spend our money [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=379.82s)]
*  supporting the witchcraft studies department at University of Texas, let's say hypothetically, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  they can pass, the legislators can pass a bill saying we zero out funding, we abolish [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  the department. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=396.7s)]
*  And in fact, we did that precisely that at New College of Florida. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=397.7s)]
*  We determined through all of the proper democratic channels and through an analysis of the evidence [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=400.86s)]
*  and some real prudent thought that our gender studies department did not meet a scholarly [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=406.3s)]
*  threshold, was not providing enough value to students, and was not in line with the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=413.5s)]
*  wishes of the voters and the citizens of the state. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=419.3s)]
*  And so we abolished that department. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=423.86s)]
*  That's obviously very clearly within the purview of political power and orienting, again, the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=425.58s)]
*  university towards truth. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=434.5s)]
*  But there's the secondary question. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=437.54s)]
*  You have to look at speech and conduct. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=439.82s)]
*  And so I don't advocate for restricting classroom speech. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  Some legislators in Texas, for example, have said, oh, we need to really tightly control [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  the speech in the classroom on X, Y, and Z issues. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=454.74s)]
*  I've made my opposition to that known. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=459.42s)]
*  I continue to express opposition to that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  There is a constitutional question. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=465.26000000000005s)]
*  But even setting aside the constitutional question, I think it's unwise for a few reasons. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=466.94s)]
*  One is that, again, it's micromanaging to the point of futility. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=471.98s)]
*  Legislators cannot successfully do this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=476.66s)]
*  But second, you should be hiring faculty members whom you trust, whom you would like to give [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=479.46000000000004s)]
*  and whom you believe are grappling with these hard questions in the most productive way [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=488.18s)]
*  possible in the classroom. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=493.26s)]
*  And you grant them as much autonomy as possible. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=494.5s)]
*  And so if you're talking about pure speech, you and I may have a similar view. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=498.86s)]
*  But when we're talking about administrative speech, for example, DEI programs that scapegoat, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=503.74s)]
*  stereotype, demean and discriminate for or against different groups based on their ancestry, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=510.14s)]
*  the law and I think just good judgment is quite clear at a state university, especially [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=517.54s)]
*  at private universities, slightly different story. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=523.86s)]
*  But at a state university, as legislators have done in Florida and Texas and Tennessee [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=526.1800000000001s)]
*  and other states, they have every right to say, this is not an academic issue. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=531.62s)]
*  It's not a free speech issue. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=536.74s)]
*  We don't want to promote these ideologies as official conduct, as official policy, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=539.14s)]
*  and as official decision making of our state universities, of the government. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=546.34s)]
*  And so I think that is a quite defensible road that we've been running down successfully [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=552.58s)]
*  and abolishing these programs that don't serve the mission of the university, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=559.46s)]
*  don't serve the interests of the people, and really don't even meet a basic threshold [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=564.26s)]
*  of responsible governance. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=569.7800000000001s)]
*  So just on the question of what you did at New College, if you, and I'm sure you've seen it, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=571.86s)]
*  you talked to professors there, you talked to students there. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=577.7s)]
*  What you were doing was very, very polarizing, very, very controversial. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=581.22s)]
*  You became kind of the symbol of, obviously you had a lot of support, including from Governor [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=585.14s)]
*  DeSantis who was elected, but you also had a lot of opposition. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=589.22s)]
*  And one of the main critiques is that you are describing or characterizing your motions [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=592.98s)]
*  in this very kind of neutral, inherently virtuous manner. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=601.94s)]
*  We just want to improve the quality of education. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=606.5s)]
*  We want to make sure it's meeting a certain scholarly threshold, that we want to make sure [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=610.02s)]
*  that these academic norms that are being permitted to govern how faculty operate align with public [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=615.0600000000001s)]
*  values, but they will say that what you basically did was you identified New College as problematic [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=623.14s)]
*  because there were a lot of faculty members. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=628.34s)]
*  Most faculty members who were essentially left-wing and that was reflected in their teaching [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=630.02s)]
*  and in their curriculum. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=635.22s)]
*  And by the time you were done, it basically turned into the opposite, namely that it aligned [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=636.18s)]
*  with your political values as a conservative. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=640.98s)]
*  Is that something that you do think in fact happened, that New College became less left-wing, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=644.9s)]
*  the ideology that you reject, and more associated with the ideology that you personally, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=652.34s)]
*  Governor DeSantis, promotes, which is conservatism? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=658.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, that's how it always works. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  That's how it works everywhere. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=665.54s)]
*  And in fact, that's how it's supposed to work. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=668.0999999999999s)]
*  The conservative voters and taxpayers of Florida, you can read the Florida Constitution, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=671.78s)]
*  and nowhere does it say that they must be forced to continue funding left-wing ideological programs [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=678.02s)]
*  within universities against their will, against their express wishes. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=684.26s)]
*  And so this is how it works. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=690.02s)]
*  And I think that I'm totally happy with California universities being kind of more left-leaning, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=692.66s)]
*  and Florida universities being more right-leaning. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=698.66s)]
*  That's completely fine. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=701.86s)]
*  Universities do not have to be and actually should not be totally homogeneous across the country. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=703.86s)]
*  And at New College in particular, it was by every metric that the state had put out, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=710.98s)]
*  the lowest performing university, the university was functionally insolvent when we took over. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=717.78s)]
*  It had failed to meet even basic student retention metrics for year after year after year. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=724.82s)]
*  The legislature in the previous session was thinking about actually just [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=731.38s)]
*  dissolving the university entirely and transferring its assets elsewhere. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=734.58s)]
*  And so this was really a rescue operation of a struggling college. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=738.74s)]
*  And whereas so many universities are hyper left-wing, especially in their conception [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=742.9s)]
*  of the humanities, actually providing a counterpoint or a counterbalance, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=749.14s)]
*  I think is really salutary for not only New College but for the university system as a whole. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=754.42s)]
*  And this doesn't mean that this is an ideological imposition in total. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=759.38s)]
*  And in fact, we abolished the gender studies department because it was [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=764.1s)]
*  really a terrible performer. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=768.26s)]
*  It was not oriented towards truth. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=770.4200000000001s)]
*  Faculty members could not even tell you what a woman was. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=773.22s)]
*  Basic kind of kindergarten level understanding of the world was just impossible for these folks. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=777.1400000000001s)]
*  But we still invited Judith Butler, who is the most famous gender theorist in the world. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=784.26s)]
*  She's been a fierce critic of me personally. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=789.22s)]
*  We invited her to speak and she actually hosted an event at New College [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=792.6600000000001s)]
*  to provide a counterpoint and a contrary view. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=797.3s)]
*  And so I don't actually buy the idea that there is a particular composition at a university that [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=800.0999999999999s)]
*  has to be required everywhere. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=808.42s)]
*  But even if you say you want to have a wide range of discourse, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=810.26s)]
*  what we've done at New College is not narrow the range of discourse. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=814.42s)]
*  We've actually expanded it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  We provided, I think, a much needed balance. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=819.8599999999999s)]
*  And then we've implemented a classical liberal arts curriculum that gives an ethos to the place [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=821.94s)]
*  that really had been lacking for many years. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  But the way you describe what you did at New College in that interview that you did with [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=832.1s)]
*  the New York Times last month is you talked about, I think, with a certain amount of pride, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=836.2600000000001s)]
*  the fact that basically you purged the entire previous administration, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=842.2600000000001s)]
*  the president and the deans and the administrators. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=846.9000000000001s)]
*  And replaced them with people that you thought aligned more with the values and ideology of the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=851.38s)]
*  residents of the state, which happens to be your ideology as well. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=860.5799999999999s)]
*  And this is what I wanted. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=864.66s)]
*  This to me is like the nub of the question, which is, you know, so often people talk about, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=865.78s)]
*  oh, we need to return to the values of the founding. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=870.18s)]
*  We need to preserve American values. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=873.78s)]
*  And you can debate what the influences were on the founders, like Machiavelli, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=876.3399999999999s)]
*  to what extent were they influenced by him? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=880.26s)]
*  Did they really like him or not? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=881.78s)]
*  Which parts did they like? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=882.9s)]
*  But I think nobody doubts that the Enlightenment and the Enlightenment thinkers were a major, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=884.18s)]
*  major influence on the American founders, just because that was the tradition out of [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=889.9399999999999s)]
*  which they were working. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=893.4599999999999s)]
*  It originated in France and in the UK and in the Netherlands, so sort of Europe, where, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=895.14s)]
*  of course, they all came from. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=901.3s)]
*  And one of, you read any Enlightenment thinker, and one of the core values that they emphasize [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=903.62s)]
*  most is the need for academic freedom, which they saw as kind of a cousin to free speech, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=908.98s)]
*  that there was supposed to be these institutions free of control or limits where anything goes [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=915.06s)]
*  in terms of the discourse. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=921.38s)]
*  And I'm wondering how that can be reconciled with what you just described your view being, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=923.6999999999999s)]
*  which is that you have to have universities that are teaching things and expressing values that [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=929.86s)]
*  align with the majority of citizens of the state or the country. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=938.1s)]
*  I mean, if you're kind of forcing universities to align with the ideology and politics of 50% [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=943.62s)]
*  plus one of the residents, what does academic freedom then mean? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=950.66s)]
*  Or maybe you don't believe in academic freedom, but if you do, what does it mean and how can [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=954.34s)]
*  it be reconciled with that view? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=958.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you have two problems with your position here. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=961.78s)]
*  The first is a historical problem. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=965.22s)]
*  You know, you're not going to find the sentiment that you expressed about academic freedom [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=967.62s)]
*  anywhere in any document related to universities and say the founding period in the United States. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=972.5799999999999s)]
*  That concept was something that came much later, and which is why William F. Buckley in the 1950s [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=979.9399999999999s)]
*  said academic freedom is a superstition. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=984.74s)]
*  And so I think you're back projecting. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=988.26s)]
*  You don't think Voltaire or Rousseau talked about that? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=991.06s)]
*  I don't think that Voltaire and Rousseau were a heavy influence on the American founding. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=992.5s)]
*  I think you could go to John Locke and the Scottish common sense Enlightenment figures. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=997.14s)]
*  And again, these people would disagree and just read the charter documents of the original [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1002.58s)]
*  universities in the United States. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1007.3000000000001s)]
*  But I think there's another problem. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1008.82s)]
*  The problem is that a university will have a set of values. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1013.14s)]
*  You know, human institutions operate according to either an implicit or explicit set of values. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1017.1400000000001s)]
*  It's how you make decisions. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1024.26s)]
*  Do we open a gender studies department or do we open an American history department? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1025.8600000000001s)]
*  Do we open a DEI bureaucracy or do we open a school for civic life? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1030.02s)]
*  Because of the limitations of space, time and money, you have to make decisions under pressure [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1037.94s)]
*  of which direction your university is going. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1044.42s)]
*  What you support, what you don't support. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1046.66s)]
*  And so in essence, your position boils down to universities should be left kind of a random [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1048.8200000000002s)]
*  selection and whatever happens should be untouched. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1054.98s)]
*  But my point is that the opposite is a much bigger problem. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1058.74s)]
*  The problem is if you have universities that are monolithically aligned against the values of, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1063.22s)]
*  let's say, 70% of the citizens, you have then citizens being compelled to fund the government [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1068.5800000000002s)]
*  that in turn is waging a kind of ideological war against the citizens. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1075.94s)]
*  And they have no redress. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1080.98s)]
*  They have no mechanism for reforming their own government, which uses their own money. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1082.3400000000001s)]
*  And so given the fact that every university will have a system of values, the question is not, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1087.8600000000001s)]
*  who should do it or should we not do it? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1096.18s)]
*  The question is, what will that system of values be? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1097.8600000000001s)]
*  At New College of Florida, we said the classical liberal arts tradition [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1100.9s)]
*  in pursuit of the true, the good and the beautiful. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1104.8999999999999s)]
*  We rewrote our mission statement to that effect. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1106.74s)]
*  And University of California Berkeley has nonstop DEI and social justice activism. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1109.78s)]
*  That's their mission. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1115.62s)]
*  And so given that a system of values is inevitable, the only responsible question is, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1116.98s)]
*  can we actually do the right thing philosophically but also do the right thing democratically? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1123.62s)]
*  And so I think honoring what I believe is the pursuit of truth, but also what has the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1131.1399999999999s)]
*  consent of the governed, of the citizens of Florida or other states, really any state, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1136.1799999999998s)]
*  I think is the right thing to do. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1142.02s)]
*  It's the responsible way. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1143.7s)]
*  And there's no getting around that problem. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1145.7s)]
*  And certainly not by appealing to the Enlightenment. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1148.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's like academic freedom was essentially invented by the professor's lobby. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1150.74s)]
*  And then kind of back projected as some great value that doesn't exist anywhere [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1158.0200000000002s)]
*  in the tradition of the, let's say, the late 18th or early 19th century. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1164.0200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I spent a lot of time in the Enlightenment. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1170.42s)]
*  It was a major focus of mine for a long time. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1173.7800000000002s)]
*  And like I said, we can't resolve that now, but I'll certainly get a lot of very specific [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0XKLKtQDc&t=1175.8600000000001s)]
