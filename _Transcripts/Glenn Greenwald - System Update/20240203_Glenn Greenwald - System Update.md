# The Final Word on Russiagateâ€”And Its Consequences in 2024
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus)
*  What I want to start with is a recollection of exactly what the scandal was about because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=0.0s)]
*  this is something that has been deliberately distorted by the people who were most involved [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=14.16s)]
*  in it who are now embarrassed about it, who know that the central claim that gave rise [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  to the scandal was completely debunked by the person they deputized to be the arbiter [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  of truth, Robert Mueller, and as a result they have an interest in pretending that it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=29.34s)]
*  was about a lot of other things that were ancillary at best to the claim of the, to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=34.62s)]
*  the core claim of the scandal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=40.34s)]
*  So here's the New York Times in May of 2017 on the day that Robert Mueller was appointed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=41.88s)]
*  as special counsel for the Russiagate investigation by the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  You may recall that the Attorney General for Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, recused himself [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=55.18s)]
*  for some reason that I still don't think is very clear. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=59.9s)]
*  As a result, his deputy Rod Rosenstein was in charge of the investigation. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=63.74s)]
*  He decided the Justice Department had to recuse itself from the investigation and appointed [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=67.5s)]
*  Robert Mueller in order to determine whether crimes were committed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=72.1s)]
*  You only have the Justice Department involved and a special counsel appointed if there's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=75.86s)]
*  reasonable grounds to believe that actual crimes were committed by American citizens. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=82.4s)]
*  And because the New York Times thought and assumed like most liberals, like most people [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=87.12s)]
*  in media, that it was absolutely clear that Mueller was going to find evidence of this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=92.44s)]
*  conspiracy and evidence of the guilt of not only people in the Trump circle but Trump [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  himself, you had Saturday Night Live singing songs to Robert Mueller about how all they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=103.84s)]
*  wanted for Christmas were indictments of Donald Trump and his family. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=110.2s)]
*  It was the religion, the obsession of large parts of America and of our political discourse [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=114.12s)]
*  for at least three years starting from the middle of the campaign until Robert Mueller [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=120.36s)]
*  finally closed his investigation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=124.12s)]
*  And at the time in May of 2017, none of these outlets doubted that this conspiracy was real. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  So they described it with very clear language what exactly it was that was alleged that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=132.16s)]
*  gave rise to the scandal in the Mueller investigation in the first place. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=138.4s)]
*  Here's the headline, quote, Robert Mueller, former FBI director, is named special counsel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=141.52s)]
*  for Russia investigation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=146.08s)]
*  Quote, the Justice Department appointed Robert S. Mueller III, a former FBI director under [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  George Bush, as special counsel on Wednesday to oversee the investigation into, and here [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  is what the investigation always was intended to determine and only this, to oversee the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=160.2s)]
*  investigation into ties between President Trump's campaign and Russian officials, dramatically [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=171.2s)]
*  raising the legal and political stakes in an affair that has threatened to engulf Mr. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump's four-month presidency. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  This was four months into his presidency. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  They were trying to suffocate his presidency with this fake scandal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=187.4s)]
*  In a statement, Mr. Trump said, quote, as I have stated many times, a thorough investigation [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=191.88s)]
*  will confirm what we already know, that there was no collusion between my campaign and any [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=197.88s)]
*  foreign entity. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=204.36s)]
*  In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=206.68s)]
*  most to the future of our country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=209.84s)]
*  Now that quote, of course, was included in the New York Times because they had to, but [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  at the time people thought it was a joke that Trump said he's very confident that the investigation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=215.52s)]
*  will finally reveal the truth, clearing him of any wrongdoing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  In the core claim, the allegation was that Russia had hacked into the email servers of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=226.0s)]
*  the DNC and John Podesta, and that the Trump campaign collaborated with them, colluded [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=235.08s)]
*  with them, conspired with them in order to do that hacking. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=241.72s)]
*  The reason that never made any sense to me from this first second I heard it was not [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  only that it was all done through anonymous leaks from the CIA and the FBI, and I know [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=253.64s)]
*  if I know anything as a journalist, it's that you do not trust evidence-free leaks from [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=259.76s)]
*  the US security state. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=265.64s)]
*  The New York Times claimed that was the lesson they learned after selling George Bush's and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=267.72s)]
*  Dick Cheney's Iraq war by front-paging every evidence-free claim that came from Dick Cheney [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=272.48s)]
*  about Iraqi WMDs and only to repeat that behavior to stop Donald Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=277.6s)]
*  It wasn't just that it was evidence-free and came from all of these intelligence agencies [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=284.2s)]
*  that have always lied to the public, but also it never made any sense. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=289.64s)]
*  Even if it were the Russians that had hacked into the email server or the email inbox of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=295.48s)]
*  John Podesta and the DNC, why would they need the help of the Trump campaign to do it? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=301.32s)]
*  But it was never about things like meetings at the Trump Tower or efforts to try and boost [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=308.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's presidency. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=315.56s)]
*  The issue, the thing that made it a criminal investigation, the only claim was that Donald [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=317.24s)]
*  Trump and Trump officials criminally collaborated with or conspired with or colluded with the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=324.72s)]
*  Russian government to do that hacking and to interfere in the 2016 election. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=330.48s)]
*  That was the claim. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=336.12s)]
*  Now the Mueller investigation, the reason why Robert Mueller was so celebrated is because [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=338.88s)]
*  he had a dream team, we were told, of the best, most aggressive prosecutors and he had [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=345.36s)]
*  been given an unlimited budget and full subpoena power and he was told go look everywhere and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=352.4s)]
*  anywhere and they went all around the world subpoenaing everybody they could find and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=358.88s)]
*  getting their hands on every document and every witness. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=363.32s)]
*  And they set up perjury traps and they were able to convict people based on crimes allegedly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  committed during the investigation, lies to the prosecutors or covering things up, but [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=372.64s)]
*  they were able to get their hands on every single thing they wanted for 18 months at [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=379.28s)]
*  drag done. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=384.11999999999995s)]
*  And when Robert Mueller finally closed his investigation and issued his report, there [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=386.4s)]
*  was one paragraph that was the decisive paragraph about the core conspiracy theory, namely that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=393.0s)]
*  Trump and Trump officials had criminally conspired with the Russian government on this hacking [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=399.64s)]
*  and to interfere in the election and here is what the Mueller investigation and again this was set [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=407.74s)]
*  up by Democrats, by the media and by the opponents of Russiagate as the supreme arbiter. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=413.94s)]
*  Robert Mueller was this old school FBI agent who only operated with integrity and gusto [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=421.22s)]
*  and nobility and he gets to the truth no matter what. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=431.66s)]
*  And here is the truth that he discovered, quote, although the investigation established [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=437.54s)]
*  that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and work to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=442.38s)]
*  secure that outcome and that the Trump campaign expected it would benefit electorally from [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=446.66s)]
*  information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=452.06s)]
*  and this is the key phrase, did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=462.06s)]
*  or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=469.3s)]
*  Anyone honest at that point reading that paragraph would have admitted immediately that everything [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=477.90000000000003s)]
*  we've been doing and saying for the last three years has been a lie because Robert Mueller [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=483.70000000000005s)]
*  was unleashed on the world, unleashed on the Trump campaign, unleashed on the Trump family [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=489.18s)]
*  and the Trump presidency and he came back 18 months later and said that they could not [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=493.94s)]
*  find evidence to establish that anyone in the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=502.26000000000005s)]
*  with the Russian government in its election interference activities and they just demonstrated [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=508.78000000000003s)]
*  from the New York Times article announcing his appointment that was what he was supposed [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=513.98s)]
*  to investigate that was the crux of the Russian and the Russiagate scandal from the start [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=518.94s)]
*  was that allegation and Mueller said there was no evidence to establish it was true. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=524.74s)]
*  It was a gigantic humiliation for every media outlet that pushed this, every media outlet [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=531.5400000000001s)]
*  that gave itself pollsters for doing so, all of the TV dudes at works that pump this nonstop [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=537.1s)]
*  for Democratic party officials led by Adam Schiff who claimed that he had seen smoking [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=544.1s)]
*  gun evidence that proved this collusion that apparently Robert Mueller never discovered [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=549.82s)]
*  because if he had he wouldn't have said we did not discover any evidence to establish [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=555.0600000000001s)]
*  this core conspiracy theory. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=560.58s)]
*  It was as much of a gutting of a knifing into the gut of American centers of power and institutional [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=562.86s)]
*  authority as you could possibly imagine easily the worst sins having to admit that there [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=572.38s)]
*  were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq 20 years earlier it was most definitely on [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=579.1s)]
*  that scale except that one difference being that there was a lot more dissent permitted [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=585.22s)]
*  in the run up to the Iraq war than there was on this. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=591.74s)]
*  I can tell you personally that any journalist who tried to question any of this or who tried [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=596.94s)]
*  to say from the start that there's no evidence being offered to substantiate it was the target [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=601.9s)]
*  of an attempt to destroy the person's career to exclude them from every media venue. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=607.78s)]
*  It was a requirement, the price of entrance to get into anywhere to affirm that you believed [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=613.6999999999999s)]
*  in Russiagate and anyone who didn't and there were not many people willing to say it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=622.5s)]
*  I was getting emails while I did and I was getting messages while I did all the time [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=627.8199999999999s)]
*  from people and media outlets saying I'm so glad you're doing what you're doing but they [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=632.1s)]
*  didn't have the courage to do so because in their defense they knew that their careers [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=636.3399999999999s)]
*  would be destroyed if they did and I always kept one foot in independent media and never [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=640.38s)]
*  relied on those large media corporations in order to have a career and so I was much freer [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=646.9399999999999s)]
*  than they were to do it but the clamp down on dissent was so extreme that they would [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=652.34s)]
*  never even put anyone on television or in the op-ed columns of major newspapers who [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=658.58s)]
*  questioned this narrative at all. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=663.7s)]
*  There were people heard who opposed the war in Iraq even though there was a lot of repression [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=666.86s)]
*  back then too, it was right after 9-11. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=671.76s)]
*  This was so much worse and the person they picked to tell us the truth ended up in saying [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=674.1s)]
*  this. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=682.94s)]
*  Now that's not all he said, this is a different passage and there's probably about 15 different [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=683.94s)]
*  passages from the Mueller investigation I could show you, the report where on every [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  claim that was made and hyped by the media and by the Democratic Party over the course [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=694.3000000000001s)]
*  they had very similar paragraphs saying our investigation could not find any evidence [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=700.56s)]
*  to establish its truth. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=707.2399999999999s)]
*  In fact, one of the main narratives, the most unhinged narrative that came from Buzzfeed's [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=710.4s)]
*  decision to publish the Steele dossier even though there was never any substantiation [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=719.2399999999999s)]
*  and the media completely got behind the Steele dossier was that Trump was being blackmailed. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=726.92s)]
*  It was one of the most deranged conspiracy theories of all time. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=733.52s)]
*  It was basically a claim that Russia had taken over the United States, had seized control [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=737.72s)]
*  of the levers of power in the United States and was forcing Donald Trump to undertake [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=743.44s)]
*  decisions that undermine American interests and served the interests of the Kremlin because [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=748.44s)]
*  of sexual, financial and personal blackmail. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=756.96s)]
*  Here for example is a tweet from Nancy Pelosi and there were so many of these, we'll just [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  keep that there where it says what do the Russians have on Trump personally, financially [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=765.7600000000001s)]
*  or politically that he's about to stand in, that he's too afraid to stand up to Putin [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=772.76s)]
*  asking for millions of Americans and our allies. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=782.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean it was Nancy Pelosi, the senior Democrat in Washington spreading this innuendo. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  Robert Mueller did not even take that claim seriously enough that Trump was the victim [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=792.8399999999999s)]
*  of Russian blackmail to even include much of anything on it in his report let alone [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=797.16s)]
*  substantiate it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=802.92s)]
*  This is why they want to memory hold this. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=805.92s)]
*  They were all saying that, that Trump was a victim of Russian blackmail and was controlled [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=808.24s)]
*  by the Kremlin to the point where Russia had seized control of the United States was something [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=812.4399999999999s)]
*  that almost every major outlet endorsed. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=816.6s)]
*  There were covers on both Time Magazine and the New Yorker showing the Kremlin infiltrating [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=819.6s)]
*  graphically the White House and basically taking it over. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=825.9000000000001s)]
*  This was a conspiracy theory as deranged as any that they claim you could find on places [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=830.58s)]
*  like 4chan or the most outer fringe precincts of the internet but it came from our most [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=836.3000000000001s)]
*  influential corporate institutions. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=845.9000000000001s)]
*  Here's another passage from the Mueller report, I'll just show you one more. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=850.3000000000001s)]
*  Just to give you a sense for how devastating it was, how fully debunked this conspiracy [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=853.66s)]
*  theory was that drowned our politics for three years. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=861.66s)]
*  The investigation, the Mueller investigation did not however yield sufficient evidence [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=865.02s)]
*  to sustain any charge that any individual associated with the Trump campaign acted as [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=870.14s)]
*  an agent of a foreign principle within the meaning of FARA or in terms of section 951 [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=877.14s)]
*  subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia or any official thereof. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=882.82s)]
*  In particular this office did not find evidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=889.1s)]
*  that campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page acted [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=894.3s)]
*  as agents of the Russian government or at the direction, control or request during the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=900.74s)]
*  relevant time period. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=906.02s)]
*  So it wasn't just that the Mueller report said we have no evidence to establish the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=909.34s)]
*  core conspiracy theory, they said we can't even find evidence to prove that any of the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=917.22s)]
*  people associated with the Trump campaign, even these kind of obscure lower level figures [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=923.7s)]
*  like George Papadopoulos or Carter Page or Paul Manafort, the campaign manager, ever [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=928.26s)]
*  acted as an agent of the Kremlin or at the direction of the Russian government. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=935.34s)]
*  A more devastating destruction of their three year narrative could not be imagined and this [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=941.66s)]
*  is why they all want to pretend that this never happened, this is why Russiagate is [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=950.66s)]
*  something you never hear about anymore and if someone like me brings it up and says hey [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=954.06s)]
*  remember when every institution of authority practically in the United States endorsed [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=958.46s)]
*  a false fabricated conspiracy theory that came from the CIA to destroy an elected president, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=963.06s)]
*  not for a week but for three years, people say oh why are you talking about Russiagate, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=969.26s)]
*  that's old news. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=973.06s)]
*  The reason it's necessary to talk about it as I said is because the full extent of what [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=976.6199999999999s)]
*  a destruction to credibility of these institutions it was and the lack of accountability has [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=981.16s)]
*  practically never been created, it has never been accepted. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=987.02s)]
*  So that was the Mueller report, that was the complete destruction of the entire scandal [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=994.5799999999999s)]
*  and yet let's remember what happened in mid 2016 when this narrative first emerged. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=1001.74s)]
*  The amazing thing is is that... [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAGXZZXOzus&t=1009.6999999999999s)]
