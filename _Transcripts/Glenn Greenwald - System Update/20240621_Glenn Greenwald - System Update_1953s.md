# Senator Rand Paul on More Dr. Fauci COVID Cover-Ups and the U.S. Anti-Vax Disinfo Campaign Abroad
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0)
*  We are very happy that Senator Rand Paul, the three term senator from the state of Kentucky [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=0.0s)]
*  and a medical doctor has become a frequent and even you could say regular guest on our [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=12.1s)]
*  show. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=17.86s)]
*  He was just on our show a couple of weeks ago to talk about the hearings where Dr. Fauci [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=18.86s)]
*  appeared and he is, we also sat down with him a little bit earlier today where we interviewed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=22.18s)]
*  him about a wide range of issues regarding what is the seemingly bipartisan resistance [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=29.06s)]
*  to really having a serious investigation to simply review what was done with the COVID [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=35.7s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=44.34s)]
*  It's something that we regularly do when we have major political controversies, the JFK [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=45.34s)]
*  assassination, the 9-11 attack, even the January 6th riot, which was of far less significance [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=49.7s)]
*  than these other events, including the COVID pandemic, all got these sort of bipartisan [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=57.059999999999995s)]
*  blue ribbon commissions to issue what was supposed to be the definitive report about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=63.58s)]
*  what happened. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=67.62s)]
*  Oftentimes we don't get the full story, but at least the recognition that these events [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=68.62s)]
*  deserve that kind of investigative attention. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  And yet none of that has happened when it comes to the COVID pandemic, even though arguably [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=75.82s)]
*  it is the single most significant and consequential event in our lifetime. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=80.6s)]
*  One of the few voices in Washington who has been relentless and continuing to pursue the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=85.66s)]
*  truth about what was done with regard to COVID policy, what was done with regard to claimants [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=90.62s)]
*  about its origin, whether the US was involved through funding and other support into research [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=96.06s)]
*  that manipulated the coronavirus and made it more dangerous and more contagious and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=102.78s)]
*  then escaped. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=107.22s)]
*  All of that are still, all of those questions are still unresolved and yet there seems to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=108.86s)]
*  be very little attention being paid to it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=113.22s)]
*  Senator Paul has been following this from the beginning. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=116.9s)]
*  He continues to follow it when a lot of other people seem to have the idea that this is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=119.7s)]
*  all in the past, we don't need to find out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=122.94s)]
*  And we sat down with him just a little bit ago to talk about some of the pending issues, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=125.06s)]
*  some of the questions that still are unanswered with regard to Dr. Fauci and his associates, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=130.74s)]
*  as well as what the future might hold when it comes to funding this very dangerous gain [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=136.34s)]
*  of function. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=141.42s)]
*  And our first here is the interview we had with Dr. Paul. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=142.78s)]
*  Senator, it's great to have you back on the show. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=145.3s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=149.5s)]
*  Let me begin with an exchange you had in the Senate this week where you, in an extremely [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=150.98s)]
*  factual way, almost without any assertions of any kind, just reading documents and laying [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=156.7s)]
*  out the timeline of what happened that led up to this journalistic and scientific scandal [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=162.6s)]
*  where they published this Lancet article proclaiming to be certain about the origins [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=168.74s)]
*  of COVID when in fact, not only were they uncertain, but what they were getting secretly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=173.34s)]
*  was information that was contrary to what they were claiming, namely that it was far [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  more likely a lab leak. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=182.5s)]
*  And then on top of that, the last time you were on the show a couple weeks ago, we talked [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=184.3s)]
*  about these emails showing that they purposely deleted emails in order to make sure they [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=187.78s)]
*  couldn't be obtainable by FOIA, which is a classic cover-up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=193.08s)]
*  In the past, when you've had major events in American political life, like the JFK assassination [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=196.78s)]
*  or the 9-11 attack, even January 6, which hails in comparison to the impact of the COVID [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=202.7s)]
*  pandemic, we've created these kind of bipartisan blue ribbon commissions of all the wise men [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=209.12s)]
*  and women in Washington who were bipartisan and they would issue a comprehensive report [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  that would be the trusted definitive account of what happened. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=220.68s)]
*  That was at least the theory. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=224.48s)]
*  And what strikes me so much is despite the fact that you can make the case that COVID [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  is the most significant event in our lifetime, we've never had any commission like that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  And there actually seems to be very little interest, even in Congress and both parties, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=236.0s)]
*  very little push to have a comprehensive accounting of what was done here, what was said here [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=240.92s)]
*  and what happened. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=246.72s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=247.72s)]
*  As a journalist, you can recall how curious people are, particularly when journalists [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=249.72s)]
*  think they're being lied to or that there's a cover-up. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=255.04s)]
*  When a government official says, I've deleted all the earlier emails, I think we're safe [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=258.24s)]
*  now, you would think that that would excite journalists across the spectrum and they would [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=263.72s)]
*  be scouring and going after every tidbit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=268.28s)]
*  That was the senior advisor to Anthony Fauci who said that, I've deleted all the emails. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=272.32s)]
*  I've been taught by the FOIA lady how to do it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=278.48s)]
*  They started changing the spelling and we actually are now refiling all these FOIA because [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  if you take the words ecohealth and you replace the vowels with numbers, it doesn't show up [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=286.44s)]
*  in FOIA. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=292.32s)]
*  Christian Anderson, one of the acolytes or disciples of Fauci, one of the virologists [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=293.52s)]
*  who wrote the paper saying there's no way this could have come from the lab while privately [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=300.32s)]
*  saying it came from the lab, they began to misspell his name with dollar signs in the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  place of the vowels. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=310.04s)]
*  Now, there's a certain irony in that since he got a nine million dollar grant shortly [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=311.44s)]
*  after he published this paper saying it couldn't have come from the lab. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  But this is the kind of thing that you would think this would excite people on both sides [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  of the aisle. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=324.24s)]
*  When the House committee brought in that senior assistant to Fauci, they did grill him pretty [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=325.64s)]
*  well. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=330.48s)]
*  But he also alleged that he thought Fauci had deleted his emails. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=331.48s)]
*  He said that he could take private messages to Fauci and call him on the phone and that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=334.8s)]
*  Fauci was smart enough to not put this stuff in writing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=339.16s)]
*  And yet, nobody's really gone after Fauci. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  The Democrats still are in love with him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  Nobody's subpoenaed his private emails or his private phone records. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=348.2s)]
*  And these are things I would have done immediately. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=353.68s)]
*  I would have given him two weeks to comply and I would have subpoenaed him because it [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=355.76s)]
*  takes a while to go through court to enforce a subpoena. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=359.04s)]
*  But I think they've let him get away with it and Democrats continue to defend him even [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=362.0s)]
*  though I think really philosophically he was a driving force behind letting gain of function [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=366.74s)]
*  research go on that led to this disaster. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=372.12s)]
*  So we're going to put that video, that exchange where you go through these events into this [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=375.28s)]
*  interview. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=379.92s)]
*  Today we are here to examine one of the most critical and debated questions of our time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=380.92s)]
*  Did COVID-19 originate in a lab? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=385.76s)]
*  To answer this question, let's revisit the early days of the pandemic and examine what [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=388.52s)]
*  some of Dr. Anthony Fauci's inner circle said privately about the origins of the virus. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  Discussions that were only revealed through FOIA litigation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=398.52s)]
*  Christian Anderson wrote, the lab escape version of this is so friggin likely to have happened [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=402.64s)]
*  because they were already doing this type of work and the molecular data is fully consistent [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  with that scenario. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=413.88s)]
*  Ian Lipkin stressed the nightmare of circumstantial evidence to assess regarding the possibility [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=415.72s)]
*  of inadvertent release given the scale of bat coronavirus research pursued in Wuhan. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=422.12s)]
*  Bob Gary said, I really can't think of a plausible natural scenario where you get from [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=428.92s)]
*  the bat virus or one very similar to it to COVID-19 where you insert exactly four amino [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=435.76s)]
*  12 nucleotides and all have to be added at the exact same time to gain this function. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=441.94s)]
*  I just can't figure out how this gets accomplished in nature. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=447.14s)]
*  According to Gary, it's not crackpot to suggest this could have happened given the gain of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=451.86s)]
*  function research we know was happening at Wuhan. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=456.9s)]
*  These are all private statements which you'll discover today differ greatly from their public [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=460.94s)]
*  statements. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=465.82s)]
*  Even Ralph Baric, world famous gain of function researcher and collaborator with Wuhan's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=467.2s)]
*  Dr. Shi admitted, so they, the Wuhan Institute of Virology have a very large collection of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  viruses in their laboratory. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  And so it's, you know, proximity is a problem. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=481.02s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=483.96s)]
*  Federal court orders revealed that even Dr. Fauci himself privately acknowledged concerns [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=486.28s)]
*  about gain of function research in Wuhan and mutations in the virus that suggest it might [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=491.5s)]
*  have been engineered just days before he commissioned the proximal origin paper. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=496.98s)]
*  Despite these private doubts, publicly these so-called experts and their allies were dismissing [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=503.16s)]
*  the lab leak theory as a conspiracy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=507.98s)]
*  Within days Anderson, Lipkin, and Gary were putting final touches on what would be remembered [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  as one of the most remarkable reversals in modern history. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=516.14s)]
*  In their proximal origin paper, these scientists concluded, we do not believe that any type [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=520.32s)]
*  of laboratory based scenario is plausible. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=526.22s)]
*  Privately, they were saying one thing, publicly they were saying another. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=529.28s)]
*  Media pundits parroted the narrative while social media platform censored discussion [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=534.58s)]
*  about the lab leak, labeling it as misinformation and stifling open discourse about the virus' [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=539.68s)]
*  origins. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=545.88s)]
*  Have several criminal referrals that you've made to the Department of Justice regarding [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=546.88s)]
*  Dr. Fauci and his associates deliberately deleting emails about major government policy [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  to evade FOIA or using things like dollar signs and characters to ensure they're not [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=558.88s)]
*  detected. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=564.92s)]
*  Those are absolutely criminal acts. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=565.92s)]
*  We've had major political scandals over attempts to conceal emails in the past from the public, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=567.92s)]
*  including the Hillary Clinton private server at her home, but others as well. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=573.4s)]
*  This is on a much larger scale. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=576.9799999999999s)]
*  And then you have the question of whether Dr. Fauci and other scientists violated gain [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=579.52s)]
*  of function limitations and limits in everything that happened here and whether he's lied to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=584.04s)]
*  Congress about it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=590.0s)]
*  Why do you think criminal investigations from the Department of Justice are warranted and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=591.68s)]
*  why do you think Merrick Garland is essentially ignoring them? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, lying to Congress is a felony, but also destroying evidence is a felony as well. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=600.24s)]
*  So I think both of those are significant and severe crimes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  It's against the law to try to avoid FOIA and to not use your government email. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=610.3399999999999s)]
*  It's not clear that that's a felony and it's not clear that it's very enforceable. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=616.2399999999999s)]
*  That's why people keep doing it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=619.8s)]
*  There have been various politicians that are accused of using private email through time. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=621.68s)]
*  But I do think that the only way you'd get to the bottom of this would be, for example, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=625.9799999999999s)]
*  David Morenz has admitted to most of these things. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  He actually did admit, we found it through FOIA, that he was doing these things. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=635.0s)]
*  But I would bring him back in for testimony because after his testimony, they brought [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=639.1600000000001s)]
*  in Anthony Fauci, basically through his 20-year acquaintance under the bus and said, hardly [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  knew the guy, never brought him into any meetings. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  He didn't attend policy meetings. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  His office was in another building and by golly, he didn't have, it sounds like he was [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=653.44s)]
*  not adhering to policy line. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=658.46s)]
*  I'd bring Morenz back in and ask him again, now that he's heard Anthony Fauci's description [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=661.44s)]
*  of him and his testimony, whether he wants to add anything because the human element [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  is he may well want to have a more complete testimony after he hears Fauci throwing under [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=671.84s)]
*  the bus. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  But really, typically in things like this, you get more information. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=678.9200000000001s)]
*  If someone who's committed malfeasance is indicted and there's someone above them, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=682.7600000000001s)]
*  they often will testify further in order for some leniency. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=686.7s)]
*  I would have hoped that he would have been prosecuted by now or at least indicted. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=691.12s)]
*  I think the FOIA lady, I reserve judgment over whether she should be indicted, but they [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=696.24s)]
*  are going to take her testimony. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  The problem with all of this is, and this is what makes a lot of Americans unhappy, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  is nobody believes Merrick Garland will indict someone because these are, Anthony Fauci is [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=707.7199999999999s)]
*  the love of the Democrat Party. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  He's the paragon of government medicine. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=714.4799999999999s)]
*  He's a paragon of government centralized government authority over your medical decision-making [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=717.24s)]
*  process and nobody believes that he'll ever be investigated or indicted by this administration. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=721.96s)]
*  That's a bad thing that if we're voting for administrations based on who they're going [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=729.0s)]
*  to prosecute. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=732.94s)]
*  That's the world we don't want to live in, but I think that's the world that's coming. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=735.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=738.12s)]
*  He himself equated himself and his pronouncements to science so that if you criticize Dr. Fauci, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=739.8s)]
*  you're automatically anti-scientific. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=746.2s)]
*  That seems to be embedded in a lot of liberal discourse and a lot of liberal mentality. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=748.96s)]
*  By liberal, I mean establishment liberal institutions that there should be no criticism or questioning [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  or accountability for Dr. Fauci because he is the science. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=758.36s)]
*  Any attempt to investigate him is basically to undermine science. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=761.76s)]
*  Let me ask you about that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=765.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, last time you were here, one of the things we discussed was the issue of gain [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=766.9000000000001s)]
*  research, which is when scientists take a certain virus or pathogen and manipulate it [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=773.24s)]
*  in a lab to make it either more contagious for humans or more fatal or dangerous for [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=778.96s)]
*  humans or both, presumably to engage in research about these viruses. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=783.52s)]
*  Of course, we talked about the justification, which is that, oh, they have to do that in [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=791.6s)]
*  the event that something like this arrives. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=795.32s)]
*  They need to be able to study these more dangerous and more contagious pathogens to figure out [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=797.0s)]
*  defenses against them. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=801.94s)]
*  But obviously, COVID-19 showed us how dangerous this research can be. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=803.86s)]
*  It's been known in science for a long time how ethically questionable it is. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=810.0200000000001s)]
*  And yet now it seems like there's almost a bipartisan movement in Washington to even [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=814.1400000000001s)]
*  go further and give this kind of research more authorization legally and even financially. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=820.3800000000001s)]
*  What is happening in terms of the debate in Congress over what to do with gain of function [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  research? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=831.42s)]
*  You know, I think there's going to be, I think nobody's saying any longer that we should [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=834.42s)]
*  do nothing. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=838.5s)]
*  So I think everybody's acknowledging something needs to be done. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=839.5s)]
*  The Biden administration has put forward some self-regulations, self-guidances from the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=842.5799999999999s)]
*  administration. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=848.02s)]
*  This is sort of like, you know, the foxes guarding the hen house, letting the people [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=849.3399999999999s)]
*  who've been committing the errors make the regulatory changes. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=854.9s)]
*  What we found out in the committee hearing is that even despite the new guidances from [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=859.42s)]
*  Biden's administration to try to prevent this from happening, three scientists from MIT [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=863.82s)]
*  decided to discover whether the guidance would work. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=869.9399999999999s)]
*  And so they went online and ordered the fragments of DNA and RNA to construct the Spanish flu. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=872.74s)]
*  And they were able to order it online. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=879.26s)]
*  Despite the attempt by the Biden administration to stop this from happening, they went to [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=881.02s)]
*  different companies, ordered different fragments, put it together in a lab, and then they warned [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=884.98s)]
*  the FBI that were doing this so they wouldn't go to jail for creating a biological weapon. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=889.26s)]
*  And they didn't create the actual infectious portion. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=893.74s)]
*  There's two strands of RNA and DNA. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=896.1s)]
*  One can lead to the infectious, the other one doesn't. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=898.46s)]
*  They created the non-infectious part of the DNA or RNA for this. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=901.26s)]
*  And just to prove that it could be done, I think that's enough evidence that just letting [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=905.58s)]
*  the administration do this isn't enough. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=910.1s)]
*  So we have legislation to create an independent committee. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=912.38s)]
*  It'll still be appointed by the president because someone's got to appoint these people. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=915.8199999999999s)]
*  There will be scientists. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=918.82s)]
*  But they will not be scientists who either receive grants for this or dispense grants. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=920.4200000000001s)]
*  They can't be in the grant making process because I think that once the money touches [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=925.5400000000001s)]
*  your hands, it gives you such a conflict that it makes it hard. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=930.0600000000001s)]
*  If you're receiving $9 million, can you really be trusted to be objective? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=933.6600000000001s)]
*  Even if you're trying to be objective, but you get money from these people, you tend [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=937.38s)]
*  to want to please the people giving the money. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=941.1600000000001s)]
*  And so it needs to be outside of NIH. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=943.44s)]
*  NIH has also resisted giving us information over the deliberations over what is gain of [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=946.1s)]
*  function. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=951.02s)]
*  So they just really have proven themselves not to be trusted. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=952.02s)]
*  And this power needs to be taken away from them. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=955.5s)]
*  We also are concerned about classified research. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=958.8199999999999s)]
*  They've been so resistant to giving us non-classified. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=962.06s)]
*  All the COVID stuff is non-classified. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=967.2199999999999s)]
*  It's supposedly not a weapon or developed as a weapon in our country. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=969.3399999999999s)]
*  And so that stuff, they're not giving it to us. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=973.34s)]
*  We wonder what they're doing in the classified world, which is a world in which our intel [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=975.74s)]
*  agencies routinely ignore our requests. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=980.0600000000001s)]
*  So if I write a request, like I want to meet with the scientists at the CIA who looked [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=983.0600000000001s)]
*  at the evidence to discover whether COVID is from a lab or from nature. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=988.3000000000001s)]
*  And I want to meet with them. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=992.34s)]
*  They just say no. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=993.4200000000001s)]
*  So that essentially means there is no oversight. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=995.0600000000001s)]
*  Now we have a whistleblower from the CIA that says that the scientists at the CIA voted [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=998.38s)]
*  six to one to say that the virus came from the lab, but then they were overruled by two [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1003.9s)]
*  superiors. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1009.1s)]
*  I want to see the arguments. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1010.46s)]
*  That's not it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't want to see who the people are if they have intelligence, came from a specific [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1012.8199999999999s)]
*  operative that would be endangered. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1016.18s)]
*  I don't need to see any of that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1018.1s)]
*  I want to see the scientific arguments that were presented before the committee. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1019.26s)]
*  I want to know why if they voted six to one to say it came from the lab, they were overruled [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1022.78s)]
*  by superiors. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1026.3799999999999s)]
*  Did it have something to do with, oh, we don't want to disrupt relations with China? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1027.7s)]
*  And look, I don't want to divorce ourselves from China. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1032.2600000000002s)]
*  I think trade with China is still good. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1034.22s)]
*  We need to still have trade with China. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1035.7800000000002s)]
*  It'd be crazy to have an embargo on China. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1037.22s)]
*  But at the same time, I don't worry about the trade so much that I'm willing to obscure [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1039.98s)]
*  the truth. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1043.9s)]
*  I really want to know what happened here so we can fix it. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1044.9s)]
*  And that's the level of things. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1048.74s)]
*  But our committee will be that we are forming, will be independent, will be able to look [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1051.0600000000002s)]
*  at all unclassified research, but also classified as well. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1054.94s)]
*  And I think this will provide oversight like we've never had before. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1058.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1061.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we talked a little bit about the amazing historical truth that when the anthrax attacks [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1062.8600000000001s)]
*  happened in 2001, October 2001, we were told, wow, this is some of the most sophisticated [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1067.98s)]
*  and weaponized and manipulated anthrax strains we have ever seen. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1073.74s)]
*  The way in which they spread and are so fatal means that some evil people like Saddam Hussein [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1077.5800000000002s)]
*  manipulated them in a lab. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1082.54s)]
*  And of course, it turned out that it in fact, according to the FBI itself, came from our [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1083.78s)]
*  own labs, our own military facilities in Fort Detrick under a classified program. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1088.6200000000001s)]
*  So it's hard to believe that at least some of that isn't still taking place. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1093.58s)]
*  Now let me ask you just about the debate over gain of function research because the dangers [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1097.34s)]
*  of gain of function research are obvious. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1103.82s)]
*  Last time when you were here, we talked about the arguments in favor of them. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1105.74s)]
*  So I can understand how reasonable people, including scientists, might think that gain [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1109.12s)]
*  of function research and very limited and safe environments might be justifiable. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1113.9599999999998s)]
*  At the same time, I'm not saying that's my view, I'm saying I can understand how some [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1118.9199999999998s)]
*  might see it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1122.9599999999998s)]
*  At the same time, there was this issue of dog experiments that Congresswoman Audrey [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1123.9599999999998s)]
*  Heller Green raised when Anthony Fauci was before the House. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1128.56s)]
*  And because it was her who raised it, media outlets were ready to say, oh, this is insane, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1132.56s)]
*  this is disinformation. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1136.8s)]
*  Even the Washington Post fact checker went and said, I assumed when I went to go fact [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1138.4s)]
*  check this that of course it would be crazy because it came from her. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1144.1200000000001s)]
*  But as it turns out, it's a lot more complicated. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1147.56s)]
*  There are actual hideous and seemingly unnecessary dog experiments taking place. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1149.76s)]
*  And then we did some of our own reporting. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1154.92s)]
*  We had Leighton Woodhouse who does a lot of reporting on this. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1156.4s)]
*  And one of the things he said was, not only are these dog experiments that are incredibly [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1160.84s)]
*  torturous for dogs unnecessary medically, a lot of times what they'll do is say, let's [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1166.12s)]
*  see what happens if we put bleach or other viruses inside dogs and then we'll just monitor [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1171.04s)]
*  them for eight weeks. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1176.2s)]
*  And then they do it and they want more funding. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1177.56s)]
*  And the next year they say, let's just put a little bit more bleach or viruses inside [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1179.24s)]
*  the dogs. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1183.56s)]
*  They change it just a little bit. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1184.56s)]
*  I wonder if you think that there's something in science where there's this sort of instinct [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1186.04s)]
*  to want to understand or discover things simply for their own sake while disregarding any [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1192.72s)]
*  ethical considerations or pragmatic dangers that that research might entail. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1200.56s)]
*  Do you think science has kind of gotten out of whack in terms of weighing the not just [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1205.04s)]
*  the benefits of research, but also the costs and dangers of it? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1210.08s)]
*  We know there's money changing hands. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1213.76s)]
*  They get paid each time and it's not a small amount of money. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1216.84s)]
*  These aren't disinterested people living like Mother Teresa and helping the poor. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1220.3200000000002s)]
*  These are people that are very wealthy, making hundreds of thousands of dollars individually [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1225.68s)]
*  and having labs that have millions of dollars. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  But I will tell you, people's sensibilities change over time. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1232.8400000000001s)]
*  So for example, when I was in medical school, we watched old video, black and white, it [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1235.68s)]
*  was gruesome what they would do to chimpanzees in simulated car accidents and brain injuries. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1240.48s)]
*  And nobody believes in that. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1246.2800000000002s)]
*  We all have decided that primates are close enough to us that we have really decided, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1247.72s)]
*  plus we have enough humans crashing their heads into brick walls that we can study the [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1253.56s)]
*  humans who die from these things, that we don't need to do this to chimpanzees and we [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1257.16s)]
*  don't do it anymore. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1260.88s)]
*  Same with dogs too. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1263.04s)]
*  And we've decided some of this stuff is too heinous. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1264.6000000000001s)]
*  But some of it goes on and this is consistent with Fauci's theory that the knowledge is [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1267.52s)]
*  worth the risk of a pandemic, but it's also worth, you know, if we have to torture a [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1272.44s)]
*  few animals, the knowledge is worth it. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1277.3200000000002s)]
*  So there was a research project in Tunisia and in this research project, they were sewing [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1279.72s)]
*  the eyelids open and infesting their eyes with sand fleas. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1284.8s)]
*  And in some of these experiments, it was annoying to the researchers that the dogs would cry [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1289.0800000000002s)]
*  so much so they removed their larynx so you couldn't hear them. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1293.68s)]
*  Now the paper was produced and this is without question produced and it has an NIAID number. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1297.4s)]
*  This is from Anthony Fauci's thing, has the number where they get the money. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1302.36s)]
*  As soon as the hue and cry came out, they looked at it and they said, lo and behold, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1306.52s)]
*  oh, our lab got money from NIAID, but we didn't use any of that money on this research. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1310.6399999999999s)]
*  We all used it on this other benign research where we didn't torture the dogs. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1315.32s)]
*  And so do I think those people are lying? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1319.8s)]
*  Without question they're lying. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1322.52s)]
*  They're lying to absolve themselves. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1323.7199999999998s)]
*  They still did the research. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1326.1999999999998s)]
*  They say, no, no, we got the money from Egypt for that or we got the money from Tunisia [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1327.1999999999998s)]
*  for that. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1331.8799999999999s)]
*  And then the US money we only use for wholesome purposes. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1332.8799999999999s)]
*  And no, you know, I've never really been involved in the animal rights stuff before, but I'm [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1337.76s)]
*  appalled by some of this stuff and have become a little bit involved in the sense that we [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1342.12s)]
*  shouldn't do needless things. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  And we were actually able to pass legislation that some animal wellness groups brought me [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1348.8s)]
*  and said that it was a requirement from the 30s that every drug had to have animal testing. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1354.3999999999999s)]
*  And we simply changed the rule to say that it's not mandatory, that if you can find a [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1360.3200000000002s)]
*  way of doing the test equivalent. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1364.8000000000002s)]
*  And really sometimes it turns out that animal testing is completely different than humans, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1367.8000000000002s)]
*  that you test something in animals that looks very dangerous, that's in humans and vice [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1372.3200000000002s)]
*  versa. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1376.28s)]
*  And this doesn't ban animal testing, but other companies in order to approve some of the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1377.28s)]
*  drugs without without, you know, using animals, which I think is a good step forward. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1383.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what people's ethical sense are is if it's absolutely necessary, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1390.5600000000002s)]
*  you can do it ethically, but not if it doesn't have necessity. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1394.3600000000001s)]
*  Just a couple more questions. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1398.88s)]
*  I want to focus in on the financial incentives that you mentioned in connection with this [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1399.88s)]
*  kind of dog research, but in another context, which is I think that at the beginning of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1404.6000000000001s)]
*  the COVID pandemic, there was a lot of license given to help policy professionals like Dr. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1408.6000000000001s)]
*  Fauci and others, because the idea was, oh, it's a novel coronavirus. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1414.5600000000002s)]
*  People don't know much about it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1418.8400000000001s)]
*  They're entitled to make mistakes, to shift their science. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1420.92s)]
*  I think most people thought that was reasonable. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1423.32s)]
*  But in retrospect, a lot of what was done that has become most controversial, including [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1425.2s)]
*  attempting to ban discussion of the lab leak, wasn't just this kind of good faith, earnest [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1430.0s)]
*  mistakes that were being made about this new science, but had all kinds of financial and [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1437.3s)]
*  political incentives, specifically with regard to banning people from raising the question [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1443.2s)]
*  of whether this might have escaped from the Wuhan lab. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1448.04s)]
*  Can you talk about the financial motives that were obviously a part of and likely motivated [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1451.0s)]
*  this attempt by Fauci and his associates to ban any questioning of whether it came from [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1457.36s)]
*  the Wuhan lab? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1461.68s)]
*  Well, for years, there were ways to get more money from researches. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1464.68s)]
*  So there's been a lot of scare talk about warnings of PENC coming. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1469.92s)]
*  So a lot of money has been spent, hundreds of millions of dollars, probably millions [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  themselves. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1480.92s)]
*  But in the wake of this, when the paper that Anderson and Bob Gary wrote, Christian Anderson [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1481.92s)]
*  got a $9 million personal contract with the NIH two months after he wrote the letter saying [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1487.32s)]
*  no way this could have come from the lab. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1493.64s)]
*  So on the one hand, I think there's an enhancement and a scariness that is promoted. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1495.56s)]
*  But on the other hand, they want to make sure that the scariness is coming from nature, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1502.0800000000002s)]
*  not from their research. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1505.1200000000001s)]
*  And the examples of things leaking are just plentiful. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1507.2s)]
*  So for example, SARS-1 came from animals. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1512.44s)]
*  We discovered it was civet cats and it died out because it wasn't very contagious. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1515.3200000000002s)]
*  It was contagious in animals, but not humans. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1519.8000000000002s)]
*  But as it died out, it actually came back into being six more times from the lab. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1522.24s)]
*  They traced six more outbreaks from the lab. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1527.8000000000002s)]
*  Allison Young has written a book on this and she lists thousands of accidents. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1530.8s)]
*  Ralph Berrick at UNC, who is said to be one of the more careful researchers and has one [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1536.1200000000001s)]
*  of the safest labs, has had a mouse escape his lab. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1540.72s)]
*  And so throughout, I mean, there are accidents happening. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think Robert Redfield closed down Fort Detrick for a couple of months because [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1548.24s)]
*  there was something going on there that he was worried about. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1554.28s)]
*  I don't think it was ever exactly revealed what was going on, but they were worried about [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1556.28s)]
*  safety. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1560.2s)]
*  And so, yeah, money is a big deal in this money. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1561.56s)]
*  That's why even the hysteria, you have to base that on the, you know, how much money [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1565.56s)]
*  is coming to these people, the more hysteria they create. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1568.96s)]
*  And then also how much of the risk is actually from nature and how much is from a lab. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1572.24s)]
*  The good thing about nature that everybody needs to know, and this is why I try not to [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1577.92s)]
*  scare people about avian flu, is that avian flu is very, very deadly, but not very infectious [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1581.44s)]
*  in humans. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1587.3600000000001s)]
*  So occasionally we're getting a human that gets this, but there's almost no reports of [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1588.42s)]
*  human to human transmission. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1593.3000000000002s)]
*  Now one way it could be adapted is in the lab. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1595.42s)]
*  If you take avian flu and you keep running it through a human cell line, like a humanized [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1599.0s)]
*  mouse, you can run avian flu 20 times and all of a sudden you got a virus coming out [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1604.5s)]
*  the other end that is actually a virus that now could infect humans. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1608.8200000000002s)]
*  That is a real danger if we modify it in the lab much more. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1613.7s)]
*  And with animals there's not a lot what we can do other than monitor the animals, which [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1617.36s)]
*  I think is a reasonable thing. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1620.4599999999998s)]
*  Surveillance, you monitor the animals, and you could also check what you find as long [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1622.26s)]
*  as you're not changing that virus. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1626.3999999999999s)]
*  You could take that virus and then see if it infects mammals, you know, to see how it's [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1628.12s)]
*  doing and see what the dangers are, but I wouldn't change that virus or try to mutate [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1631.6999999999998s)]
*  it to make it more transmissible among humans. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1636.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and of course I think the scandal of the Lancet article was that so many people [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1639.26s)]
*  who likely had a connection to the Wuhan lab ended up being the arbiters about whether [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1644.0s)]
*  that Wuhan lab and the funding in which they were involved was what led to the COVID pandemic. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1648.6399999999999s)]
*  And shockingly they concluded, oh no, that what we did had nothing to do with the COVID [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1653.1399999999999s)]
*  pandemic, the Wuhan lab had nothing to do with it, it came from nature. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1657.32s)]
*  Just a standard conflict of interest that to this day has never really been held accountable. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1660.1s)]
*  Let me, as a final question, ask you this. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1666.3999999999999s)]
*  There was a Reuters investigation, quite good journalism I would say, that uncovered [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1669.54s)]
*  and revealed this online clandestine Pentagon campaign using very similar tactics that we [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1674.34s)]
*  claim the Russians used in 2016, fake Facebook pages and online fake Twitter accounts and [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1680.94s)]
*  bots and the like, in order to spread disinformation about the Chinese vaccine, trying to convince [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1687.42s)]
*  very poor countries who couldn't get the vaccine except from China that was giving it to free, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1694.2s)]
*  that they should have doubts about the vaccine, about its efficacy, about its safety. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1699.1s)]
*  Now obviously a lot of people have doubts like that about all vaccines, the Pfizer vaccine, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1702.2199999999998s)]
*  all of Moderna, etc. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1706.98s)]
*  But the position of the US government at the time was that it's essentially criminal to [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1709.4199999999998s)]
*  foster doubts or hesitancy, let alone anti-vax messaging about the vaccine because people [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1716.1s)]
*  who do that are killing people, are causing the deaths of other people. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1722.58s)]
*  People in the United States were forced to take the vaccine upon pain of losing their [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1726.4s)]
*  jobs or freedom of movement. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1729.2800000000002s)]
*  Obviously people who questioned the vaccine were censored from big tech for a long time. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1732.64s)]
*  And yet at the exact same time, the US government was in the poorest countries in the world, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1737.0400000000002s)]
*  like the Philippines and places in the Middle East, scaring people about taking the only [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1741.7s)]
*  vaccine they could get, which was the Chinese vaccine, not because they were really concerned [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1745.4s)]
*  about the China vaccine, but because they wanted to prevent China from gaining a sort [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1749.14s)]
*  of PR victory in these countries by being the ones to offer the vaccine to these people [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1753.68s)]
*  who couldn't get it elsewhere. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1757.76s)]
*  What do you make of this sort of obvious conflict between the public posture of the US government [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1759.02s)]
*  and what they were doing in secret to spread what you could only really call anti-vax messaging? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1765.1000000000001s)]
*  I guess it doesn't surprise me that the government is dishonest. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1770.0s)]
*  When they start talking about misinformation and they're worried about politicians or people [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1775.24s)]
*  on the right or left spreading misinformation, I remind people that the greatest purveyor [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1779.6s)]
*  of misinformation in the history of time has been governments. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1784.28s)]
*  And so it doesn't surprise me. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1787.9199999999998s)]
*  But when it's recounted that they're casting doubt on a Chinese vaccine versus ours, my [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1789.82s)]
*  first question is who benefits? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1795.62s)]
*  But it sounds like Moderna and Pfizer might benefit if people use less Chinese vaccine, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1798.4399999999998s)]
*  maybe they use more American pharmaceutical vaccine. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1803.84s)]
*  And so it worries me that billions of dollars are being made here. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1807.24s)]
*  And I remember the manufacturers coming here and whining as the virus was getting less [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1811.68s)]
*  dangerous and nobody was paying attention to vaccinating their kids for COVID because [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1816.02s)]
*  no kids were dying from this. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1819.88s)]
*  It's like, what can we do? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1821.36s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1822.92s)]
*  And everybody's wringing their hands that profit's going down. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1823.92s)]
*  And look, I'm all for profit. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1826.72s)]
*  I'm for capitalism, but I'm not for the government mandating someone's profit. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1828.16s)]
*  But I would worry that some of this might have been done at the behest of American pharmaceutical [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1832.56s)]
*  companies and it should be investigated. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1836.28s)]
*  It also could just be nationalism. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1838.32s)]
*  There's a lot of, I think, crazy, crazy overzealous nationalism. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1840.0s)]
*  But you think your nationalism wouldn't be if the vaccine really is effective and that's [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1844.88s)]
*  what it's showing, that you'd like, you know, wish that the elderly in Indonesia or the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1849.06s)]
*  Philippines would die with no vaccine. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1854.04s)]
*  So let's hope it wasn't that. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1856.52s)]
*  But it seems like a really less than moral or less than an American, hopefully an American [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1858.52s)]
*  standard would be to actually be against a vaccine that might be saving lives. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1864.08s)]
*  And the Chinese vaccine, I think a lot of them are sort of killed vaccines the way we [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1869.24s)]
*  have made vaccines traditionally in this country. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1873.6s)]
*  And like all the coronavirus vaccines, they have deficiencies because the virus evolves [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1876.52s)]
*  and they aren't as effective over time. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1881.48s)]
*  But I think they're about the same as ours. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1883.68s)]
*  There was some reduction in severe disease and death in the very vulnerable. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1885.92s)]
*  Well, I wish I could say I was shocked and I guess I can't, but I definitely am outraged [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1891.04s)]
*  at how little interest there is in digging into all these things that happen with respect [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1895.96s)]
*  to the covid vaccine, the restrictions on our discourse, the banning of questions about [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1899.92s)]
*  the origin. I'm very glad that you're there being sober on this about trying to uncover [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1905.52s)]
*  this. I think that should be the role of journalists as well, even though in the United [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1910.2s)]
*  States these days, less and less it seems to be. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1913.1599999999999s)]
*  But I have no doubt that you're continue to do that work. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBS6f6yzdW0&t=1916.44s)]
