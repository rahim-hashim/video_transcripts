# New Study Reveals Radically Increased Gaza Death Toll
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs)
*  Now, just to add one last point to this that's about the war itself in case you're still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=0.0s)]
*  in doubt about whether people should have the right in the United States to protest [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=12.08s)]
*  this war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=15.08s)]
*  There has long been debate about how many children and women and innocent people Israel [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=17.44s)]
*  has killed in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=22.72s)]
*  Typically the count comes from what's called the Gazan Health Ministry, which is run by [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=25.92s)]
*  Hamas as the governing body, and that's supposed to imply that they're fabricating numbers, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=30.82s)]
*  that what they're saying is unreliable, even though these numbers have been repeatedly [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  verified by the World Health Organization and the UN. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=40.46s)]
*  Also then they just get called anti-Semitic. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=43.72s)]
*  Even the US government has said that those numbers from the Gazan Health Ministry are [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=47.6s)]
*  almost certainly undercounting the number of people killed in Gaza because they only [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  count the number of people who go through the morgues. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=55.279999999999994s)]
*  But because there are so many people buried under buildings that they can't remove because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=60.08s)]
*  they don't have the equipment or the electricity or the fuel to remove the rubble, and because [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=64.96s)]
*  there's basically no more health system in Gaza because the hospitals have all been destroyed, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=69.84s)]
*  huge numbers of people who are being killed by the Israelis in Gaza don't go through the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=73.96s)]
*  morgue and therefore aren't part of the official count. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=78.74s)]
*  And people, including the United States government that's funding and arming Israel, have been [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=81.3s)]
*  saying for months that the count, if anything, is radically undercounted. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=84.14s)]
*  Here is an article in The Lancet published just at the end of last week on July 5th, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=89.78s)]
*  and I realize that The Lancet unfortunately has actually sacrificed a lot of its credibility [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=96.5s)]
*  because they're the ones who published the so-called proximal origins of the COVID, the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  COVID-19 pandemic in early February 2020 that purported to know for certain that the pandemic [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=107.58s)]
*  was caused through natural evolution and species jumping and not through a lab leak. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=115.46s)]
*  And there were all kinds of journalistic scandals and conflicts of interest surrounding that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=121.06s)]
*  false proclamation in The Lancet. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=124.98s)]
*  And I do think The Lancet should be suspect in terms of their editorial process because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=127.86s)]
*  of that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=132.54s)]
*  That's part of the accountability of publishing something so irresponsible and reckless. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=133.54s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that every study published in The Lancet is to be disregarded. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=137.62s)]
*  And here The Lancet has long had a reputation for editorial rigor when it comes to science, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=141.66s)]
*  statistics, and things of that nature. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=146.62s)]
*  And so you can take this for what it's worth based on what the evidence cited for it is, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=151.18s)]
*  quote, counting the debt in Gaza, a difficult but essential. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=155.7s)]
*  It's published by Rashid Khatib of the Institute of Community and Public Health, Martin McKee, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=160.22s)]
*  the Department of Public Health and Policy at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=164.86s)]
*  Medicine in London, Saleem Youssef, the Population Health Research Institute of McMaster University, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=168.22000000000003s)]
*  and Hamilton Health Sciences in Canada. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=174.22000000000003s)]
*  And they say the following, quote, by June 19, 2024, 37,396 people have been killed in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=177.18s)]
*  the Gaza Strip since the attack by Hamas and the Israeli invasion in October 2023, according [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=184.02s)]
*  to the Gaza Health Ministry, as reported by the U.S. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  The ministry's figures have been contested by the Israeli authorities, although they [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=192.78s)]
*  have been accepted as accurate by Israeli intelligence services, the UN and World Health [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=199.3s)]
*  Organization. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=204.66s)]
*  These data are supported by independent analyses comparing changes in the number of deaths [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=206.26s)]
*  of UN relief and works agency staff with those reported by the ministry, which found claims [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=210.5s)]
*  of data fabrication implausible. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  The ministry has had to augment its usual reporting based on people dying in its hospitals [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=218.76s)]
*  or brought in dead with information from media reliable media sources and first responders. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=223.44s)]
*  This change has inevitably degraded the detailed data recorded previously. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=229.76s)]
*  Consequently, the Gaza Health Ministry now reports separately the number of unidentified [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  bodies among the total death toll as of May 10, 2024, 30% of the 35,000 deaths were unidentified. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=237.56s)]
*  Some officials and news agencies have used the development designed to improve data [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=245.78s)]
*  quality to undermine the veracity of the data, however, the number of reported deaths is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=249.24s)]
*  likely an underestimate. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=253.82s)]
*  The non-governmental organization Air Wars undertakes detailed assessment and incidents [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=256.7s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip and often finds that not all names of identifiable victims are included [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=261.14s)]
*  in the ministry's list. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=266.02s)]
*  Furthermore, the UN estimates that by February 29, 2024, 35% of buildings in the Gaza Strip [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=267.64s)]
*  had been destroyed. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=273.44s)]
*  So the number of bodies still buried in the rubble is likely substantial with estimates [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=275.42s)]
*  of more than 10,000. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=279.6s)]
*  The total death toll is expected to be large given the intensity of this conflict, the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=282.0s)]
*  destroyed healthcare infrastructure, the severe shortages of food, water and shelter, the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=286.54s)]
*  population's inability to flee to safe spaces and the loss of funding to earn right one [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=291.02000000000004s)]
*  of the few humanitarian organizations still active in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  In recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=300.42s)]
*  direct deaths. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=304.8s)]
*  Applying a conservative estimate, a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=306.8s)]
*  death to the 27,000 deaths reported is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=311.96s)]
*  or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  Using the 2022 Gaza Strip population estimate of 2.3 million, this would translate to seven [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  to nine percent of the total population of the Gaza Strip, seven to nine percent of the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=331.22s)]
*  total population of the Gaza Strip killed directly or indirectly through the war in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=337.94000000000005s)]
*  Gaza, indirectly meaning from infections that are untreated, from injuries that are untreated, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=342.22s)]
*  from malnourishment, not just people who were shot or blown up in bombs that went to the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=346.74s)]
*  morgue. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=351.5s)]
*  There are all kinds of indirect deaths that come from, especially a siege of this kind [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=352.5s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=358.1s)]
*  A report from February 7, 2024, at the time when the direct death toll was 28,000, estimated [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=359.1s)]
*  that without a ceasefire, there would be between 58,000 deaths without an epidemic or escalation [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=365.66s)]
*  and 85,700 deaths by October 6, 2024. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=371.5s)]
*  So according to the study, the number is at least 70, 80,000 when you count uncounted [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  dead people and then if you add indirect deaths, you're up to 150, 180,000 and counting, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=384.22s)]
*  which is seven to nine percent of the total population of Gaza that had been killed directly [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=390.3s)]
*  or indirectly as a result of the war. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=395.86s)]
*  Now just to indicate to you why it has been so cynical for people to call into question [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=399.66s)]
*  these numbers provided by the health ministry in Gaza, the economist back in November of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=405.1s)]
*  The economist has been an outspoken supporter of Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=411.62s)]
*  They've long been very pro-Israel. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=415.86s)]
*  This is what they said back in November of 2023, the deaths in Gaza surpassed 14,000 [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=419.26s)]
*  according to its authorities. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=425.14s)]
*  More than a third of the dead are children. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=426.14s)]
*  And then they tried to analyze whether these numbers should be deemed reliable. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=429.82s)]
*  And this is what they said, quote, the Gaza authorities figures, death figures have been [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=433.98s)]
*  called unreliable by some, including Joe Biden. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=437.86s)]
*  International agencies, however, say the overall numbers are reliable. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=442.54s)]
*  They are compiled by hospital workers, not Hamas apparatchiks. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=446.18s)]
*  On November 8th, in testimony to Congress, a member of Mr. Biden's team said that it [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  was, quote, very possible that death counts were, quote, even higher than is being reported. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=454.7s)]
*  And I think this is the key thing to take note of when it comes to the question of whether [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=460.94s)]
*  these figures are reliable. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=468.5s)]
*  In previous conflicts, meaning in previous conflicts where Israel has bombed Gaza, the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=470.38s)]
*  UN and other independent organizations have come up with tallies that are nearly identical [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=477.42s)]
*  to those provided by the God the health ministry. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=483.1s)]
*  In other words, in the past, these numbers of deaths provided by the Hamas run Gaza health [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=485.14s)]
*  industry have been extremely reliable because they simply count people who go through the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  morgue and their health care workers doing that job. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=497.62s)]
*  But in this case, it just stands to reason. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=502.18s)]
*  And the data is provided in the Lancet article that when you count the number of people under [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=505.34s)]
*  the rubble who haven't been able to be rescued, who never made it to the morgue and likely [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=508.5s)]
*  never will. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=511.26s)]
*  Combined with the collapse of the health care system, which means people don't go to hospitals [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=513.62s)]
*  and don't die in hospitals, they die everywhere else. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=516.7s)]
*  It's almost certainly the case that there are thousands and likely tens of thousands [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=520.54s)]
*  of people who are uncounted, but part of the people, the death toll of people who have [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=524.02s)]
*  actually died in Gaza. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=527.9399999999999s)]
*  Here from the Hill, back in November, they reported the death toll in Gaza is likely, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=529.86s)]
*  quote, higher than is being reported. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=535.42s)]
*  And that's from a U.S. official. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=537.74s)]
*  And obviously, if the Biden administration is saying that, given that they're the ones [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=538.94s)]
*  funding and arming the war, that's something to take into account. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=542.14s)]
*  Quote, a senior Biden administration official said the death toll of Palestinians in the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=545.9s)]
*  Gaza Strip is likely far higher than the 10,000 number being reported by the health ministry [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=549.14s)]
*  amid Israel's war against Hamas. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=554.1s)]
*  Barbara Leif, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told a House panel [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=557.02s)]
*  those killed more than one month into the war are likely, quote, higher than is being [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=561.74s)]
*  cited. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=565.74s)]
*  And of course, I don't believe assertions by the Biden administration, but in this case, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=567.74s)]
*  when people make assertions contrary to their interests, in other words, the Biden administration [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=572.38s)]
*  is funding and arming the war in Israel, defending it and justifying it, their interest is in [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=576.54s)]
*  minimizing the death toll of even they're saying the number of people killed in Gaza [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=581.14s)]
*  is likely higher than the official death toll. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=585.9s)]
*  That's a statement against their interest and therefore much reliable, much more reliable. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=589.46s)]
*  Now here just to underscore, the point is a report from the Wall Street Journal in the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=593.62s)]
*  late April of 2024. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=600.74s)]
*  Just listen to this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=603.58s)]
*  Wall Street Journal is another outlet that has been vehemently supported with the Israeli [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=604.94s)]
*  war in Gaza, editorially, and yet listen to what they report, quote, in Gaza, authorities [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=608.66s)]
*  lose count of the dead. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=614.66s)]
*  The collapse of hospitals and rescue services mean many now die in obscurity, meaning not [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=617.1s)]
*  counted. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=621.98s)]
*  Quote, Gaza's Palestinian health authorities say they can no longer count all their dead. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=622.98s)]
*  Hospital emergency services and communications are barely functioning. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=629.38s)]
*  Extracting bodies from the vast number of collapsed building is a gargantuan task and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  not a priority while the war continues. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=638.66s)]
*  The scale of the Palestinian numbers treated with varying degrees of skepticism early on [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=641.3000000000001s)]
*  in the war is now broadly accepted by UN experts, US officials, and some Israeli military [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=645.98s)]
*  officials. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=653.0600000000001s)]
*  The Palestinian authorities say the figures in recent months have become less accurate [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=654.0600000000001s)]
*  given the difficulty in gathering data. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=658.74s)]
*  Quote, at the beginning we had systems, we had hospitals, said Meded Abbas, a spokesman [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=660.78s)]
*  for the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=665.74s)]
*  Quote, the civil defense teams were able to get people who were stuck under the rubble, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=668.38s)]
*  then the whole system collapsed. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=672.3000000000001s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal goes on, quote, the true picture of the worst human toll will [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=674.86s)]
*  take a long time to emerge as thousands are estimated to remain buried under the rubble [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=679.1s)]
*  and in unmasked graves according to local health authorities, witnesses, and the United [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=684.5s)]
*  Nations. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=689.0600000000001s)]
*  So here's what I know. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=690.0600000000001s)]
*  I've made my position very clear on the immorality and criminality of the Israeli war in Gaza. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=692.46s)]
*  People can have different opinions. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=698.58s)]
*  But when you have a war of this magnitude of unprecedented civilian destruction, funded [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=700.5s)]
*  and armed by the United States government, what I know for certain is this, that as American [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=706.4s)]
*  citizens we absolutely must preserve and demand the preservation of our complete and unfettered [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=711.42s)]
*  right to openly debate US policy in Israel and the Israeli war in Gaza, to have the same [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=718.62s)]
*  exact free speech principles applied to criticism of Israel and their war and the US support [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=725.46s)]
*  for it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=730.26s)]
*  And yet since October 7th, both legislatively on the federal and state level, culturally, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=731.26s)]
*  politically, and in business, more and more there is a constriction around the necks of [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=737.5400000000001s)]
*  those questioning or criticizing this war in a way that is deeply unhealthy and directly [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=743.0600000000001s)]
*  contrary to everybody who has spent the last decade pretending that they believe in free [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=749.58s)]
*  speech or principles of basic liberty. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0Gtyvv1Rs&t=753.6s)]
