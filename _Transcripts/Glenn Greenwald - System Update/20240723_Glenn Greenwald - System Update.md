# Biden Withdrawal: What happens next?; Kamala Harris: The Reality VS The Image
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4)
*  Good evening everybody, it is July 22nd. Welcome to a new episode of System Update, our live [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=0.0s)]
*  nightly show that airs every Monday through Friday at 7 p.m. Eastern, exclusively here [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=11.44s)]
*  on Rumble, the free speech alternative to YouTube. Tonight, we have a very special guest [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=16.34s)]
*  on System Update and I'm excited to announce who it is. That special guest is myself, as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=22.5s)]
*  I think many of you know, I announced it on Friday, I'm actually on vacation, I was taking [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=29.14s)]
*  a vacation starting on Saturday for the next 10 days or so and I announced that we would [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  have at least one, maybe a series of guest hosts to cover the show. We are going to be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=38.82s)]
*  on there every night while I'm traveling, but obviously there was no way for me to simply [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=43.86s)]
*  disappear and not comment on an event as momentous, as historic, as bizarre, and as meaningful [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=49.32s)]
*  as Joe Biden's so-called decision to no longer seek the Democratic nomination for president, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=59.14s)]
*  despite the fact that it recently is 24 hours before his announcement on Sunday, he and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=66.98s)]
*  everybody close to him were continuing to insist that there was no chance at all that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=72.86s)]
*  he was going to withdraw from the race. He continued to vow that he was staying in the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=77.78s)]
*  race until the end no matter what. He even said that he had campaign events scheduled [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=82.18s)]
*  for this upcoming week that he didn't care how many Democratic elites or officeholders [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=86.78s)]
*  or donors continue to try and pressure him out of the race. He believed, I think somewhat [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=91.34s)]
*  validly, that he was the voters choice to be the Democratic nominee for 2024 as weird [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=96.22s)]
*  and bizarre and manipulated that 2024 vote was that was still the Democratic Party's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  process for choosing their nominee, quote unquote, democratically. He was its choice. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=111.86s)]
*  And he said he's never leaving. And yet out of the blue, in a huge surprise to pretty [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=116.46s)]
*  much everybody, other than about three people in his home in Delaware, where he is self [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=121.58s)]
*  isolating due to COVID, he announced on Saturday night, or at least under his name was announced [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=129.45999999999998s)]
*  under his Twitter name was announced a decision in a letter written on his personal stationary [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=137.1s)]
*  and purportedly signed by him that he was had decided that he was going to leave the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=143.54s)]
*  race after all. And then very shortly thereafter, there was an actual tweet, not a signed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=147.94s)]
*  letter, but just a tweet under the bill by an account announcing that not only was he [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=153.22s)]
*  leaving, but that he was endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris to become the nominee [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=156.62s)]
*  in his place for the president as the president's nominee for the Democratic Party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=162.78s)]
*  Now, there's a lot to say about this. And because I'm on vacation, I'm going to limit [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=168.14s)]
*  some of what I say, I'll probably have a lot more to say when I get back if there's other [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=172.1s)]
*  major news events while I'm traveling, I will certainly do my best to weigh in. But only [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=176.1s)]
*  in that case, my kids will kill me if I do it too often. But I did want to share a few [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=181.02s)]
*  thoughts about what happened here. Because as I said, it is a event of massive proportion [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=186.46s)]
*  of historic proportion. And there's a lot of things that I think are it gives provokes [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=194.74s)]
*  a lot of questions that really still haven't been answered. So first of all, let us just [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=200.62s)]
*  note that for eight years now, we have heard from the Democratic Party, its defenders, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=204.78s)]
*  its media allies, pretty much everyone who admits they support the Democratic Party or [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=210.82s)]
*  hides the fact that they support this Democratic Party, the same message repetitively [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=216.94s)]
*  offered over and over, which is that democracy, American democracy is in peril. The survival [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=222.46s)]
*  of American democracy is in danger. And the only way it can be saved is if you vote [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=228.3s)]
*  for the Democratic Party. That was their message in 2016. That was their message in 2020. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  It's their message again this year. And if you look at their behavior as a party, I would [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  say they are the strangest guardians of democracy you could ever possibly find. Just look at [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  how they've conducted themselves in their last three so-called primaries. In 2016, when [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=252.26s)]
*  Bernie Sanders went against Hillary Clinton did far, far better than anyone expected. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=258.5s)]
*  She was supposed to have a cakewalk to a coronation. The DNC intervened and cheated. And in the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=262.3s)]
*  words, not of me, but of Elizabeth Warren and Donna Brazil, the former chairwoman of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=269.86s)]
*  the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Party, quote, rigged the vote to ensure that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=273.98s)]
*  Hillary Clinton would win and that Bernie would lose. And as you probably recall, WikiLeaks [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=280.18s)]
*  leaked a large amount of documents that revealed specifically how the DNC was cheating. And as a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=285.98s)]
*  result, right before the Democratic convention, top officials of the Democratic National [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=291.82s)]
*  Committee, including W. Oscar Shultz and all of our minions, were forced to resign because of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=296.42s)]
*  the embarrassment of how anti-democratic that race was, how manipulated it was, how rigged it [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=300.5s)]
*  was, how much cheating the DNC did to deny the voters of the Democratic Party the right to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=305.74s)]
*  democratically choose the nominee because they were scared that the voter would choose wrong, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=310.54s)]
*  that they would choose Bernie Sanders, and they cheated to make sure Hillary Clinton got the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=314.62s)]
*  nomination. In 2020, after Bernie won the first three primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=317.7s)]
*  especially in Nevada, where he crushed the field, Barack Obama, by all his accounts, in one day [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=325.1s)]
*  making secret phone calls, forced three other establishment candidates out of the race, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=331.7s)]
*  including Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who up until that point were getting a significant vote [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=336.86s)]
*  total from people who liked the Democratic establishment, knowing that Barack Obama did, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=341.78s)]
*  that he was, they were taking away the votes from Joe Biden. The only two candidates left were, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=345.34s)]
*  besides Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren. They allowed to stay in the race past Super Tuesday, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=350.26s)]
*  even though her candidacy was a complete debacle. She was both loved by a lot of Democratic elites, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=354.62s)]
*  was funded by dark money, a dark money pack by a Silicon Valley fan of hers. But other than that, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=359.9s)]
*  I mean, she even came third place on her own stage. She had no chance. And the only reason [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  Obama wanted her and let her stay in the race was because she was at least going to take away [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=369.34s)]
*  votes from Bernie Sanders. And that is how Joe Biden became the nominee. In fact, when Joe Biden, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  over the course of the last month, since the debate began ranting and raving about the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=379.97999999999996s)]
*  quote unquote, Democratic elites were trying to force him from the race, a lot of those Democratic [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=384.78s)]
*  elites went on television quite angry to say, I think Joe Biden is the last person who ought to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=389.66s)]
*  be ranting and raving about Democratic elites, given that it was we, the Democratic elites, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=395.42s)]
*  who in 2020, ensure that he would win by doing exactly what I explained. And then in 2024, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=400.06s)]
*  and we showed you this video many times, they had Simone Sanders, who used to be a high level [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=407.42s)]
*  staffer in the White House working for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris go on television. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=413.34000000000003s)]
*  And when asked how is the Democratic Party primary going to work, you have two candidates [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=417.74s)]
*  running against Joe Biden so far, R.F.K. Jr. and Marion Williamson, and she and Alice on behalf of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=421.58s)]
*  the DNC, that there would be no primaries period. So when you have a sitting president who's a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=426.7s)]
*  Democrat, and he says he wants to run for your election, that's the end of the story. She said [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=432.54s)]
*  the DNC will not allow any debates. It will not, in her words, quote, facilitate a primary. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=436.7s)]
*  I really think that the mealy mouth Democrats, as I like to call them, and some of my progressive [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=443.9s)]
*  friends who would like to live in a fantasy land, they need to come back to reality. And the reality [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=449.66s)]
*  is this, the sitting president of the United States of America is a Democrat, a Democrat that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=455.18s)]
*  would like to run for reelection so much so that he has declared a reelection campaign. In that case, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=459.82s)]
*  the Democratic National Committee will not facilitate a primary process. There will be no [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=465.1s)]
*  debate stage for Bobby Kennedy, Marion Williamson, or anyone else to stand on. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=469.66s)]
*  We're going to have another Bobby Kennedy and an empty chair in the debate, right? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=474.14000000000004s)]
*  There will be no debate. Yeah, no debate. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=478.06s)]
*  The Democratic National Committee administers the debates, and they're not going to set up a [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=480.22s)]
*  primary process for debates for someone to challenge the head of the Democratic Party. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=483.98s)]
*  Open opposition, people like Marion Williamson and Dean Phillips, you eventually joined the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=488.38s)]
*  R.F.K. left the Democratic Party in renaissance because there was no fair opportunity to run [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  against Joe Biden. The DNC foreclosed any opportunity to choose any other candidate [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=497.82s)]
*  democratically. So that's been the very anti-democratic means by which the Democratic [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=502.86s)]
*  Party has chosen its own money in the last three primary races. And then when they decided [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=509.09999999999997s)]
*  after that debate that they could no longer rely on the public and pretend that Joe Biden was [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=516.38s)]
*  cognitively capable after spending months of accusing everybody who was raising questions [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=520.06s)]
*  or doubts about Biden's cognitive capability, accusing those of us who did that of spreading [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=526.54s)]
*  misinformation and fake news, of being far-right operatives, on a dime they did a 180 and said, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=530.62s)]
*  yes, not only is Joe Biden cognitively disabled, as we've been denying for months and years, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=537.66s)]
*  in fact, he's so cognitively disabled that we want to force him from the race. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=542.62s)]
*  And over the last month, Joe Biden has made abundantly clear over and over that not only [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=546.9399999999999s)]
*  did he have no intention of leaving the race, he was adamant upon about staying in. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=551.18s)]
*  And yet a group of Democratic elites, massive Democratic funders, first threatened to cut [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=556.9399999999999s)]
*  off the funding for the Biden campaign and then in fact cut off that funding. Nancy Pelosi and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=561.74s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama, the leaders of the Democratic Party, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=567.42s)]
*  first coordinated in secret and then out in the open to force Biden from the race with a series [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=571.66s)]
*  of daily incessant leaks designed to force him out of that race. And finally, apparently, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=577.26s)]
*  they drove Joe Biden out of the race. So essentially, Democratic elites pretended [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=583.34s)]
*  that Biden was selected as the nominee of their party democratically. And then once those elites [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=587.9s)]
*  wanted him out because they no longer believed he could beat Donald Trump after that debate, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=592.7s)]
*  not only did they force him out of the race, but now they've chosen his replacement without any [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=597.26s)]
*  consultation on the part of the voters, which is Kamala Harris, after one Democratic leader, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=601.9s)]
*  after the next, including now Nancy Pelosi and the Clintons, both Bill and Hillary Clinton, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  and major Democratic Party leaders, including now AOC, have all come out and endorsed Kamala Harris, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=613.34s)]
*  making very clear it's a united Democratic Party front. They will not allow any alternatives [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=619.98s)]
*  to even be considered. So again, they chose the nominee, their fourth in four years, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=624.38s)]
*  in a completely anti-Democratic way, not just not democratically, but in an aggressively [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=630.62s)]
*  anti-Democratic way in back rooms, picked by operatives of the Democratic Party at the same [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=635.1s)]
*  time. This very same party is insisting that the only way democracy can be saved as though [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=641.26s)]
*  they're arrogance of the Democratic values is if you vote for them. Second point I think is really [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=645.66s)]
*  worth noting is the extremely strange manner in which Joe Biden pulled out of the race and then [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=652.22s)]
*  announced what is said to be his decision. Now, there are a lot of conspiracy theories circulating [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=659.5s)]
*  around, which I completely understand given how this was done. I'm not in any way on board with [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=665.26s)]
*  those. I don't think there's any evidence for them about things like they kind of just took Joe [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=670.22s)]
*  Biden and forced his hand to sign or that he didn't really decide this or that even though [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=675.1s)]
*  even that he may be very physically ill or even dead. But I understand why [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=681.02s)]
*  conspiracy circulate when you have no transparency and when events are deliberately left is extremely [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=686.3000000000001s)]
*  strange. People have so little faith and trust in media institutions and in institutions of authority [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=692.0600000000001s)]
*  generally that of course they're going to wonder if they're being lied to again, if they're being [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=698.78s)]
*  deceived again. One of the news stories that got so little attention because of Biden's decision [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=703.18s)]
*  was the fact that after Donald Trump was shot as part of an assassination attempt, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=709.98s)]
*  there was a lot of stories saying coming from the Trump campaign that they had repeatedly asked for [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=715.5799999999999s)]
*  more and more security from Secret Service and they were repeatedly denied the ability to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=720.4599999999999s)]
*  have any Secret Service. And when that happened, the head of the Secret Service came out and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=729.26s)]
*  denied it. As did other officials in Washington. They said no, this is an absolute lie. This never [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=736.9399999999999s)]
*  happened. There was no request from the Trump campaign for any additional Secret Service. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=741.74s)]
*  And then quietly about two days ago, those same officials came out and said, actually what we [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=746.6999999999999s)]
*  said was false. And they announced it on I think a Friday afternoon where no one pays attention. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=752.14s)]
*  That's always the time to get bad news out. So they lie constantly. These institutions do. And [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=757.02s)]
*  so I understand why people rely on conspiracy theories to try and understand the world. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  But what happened here is bizarre. Joe Biden, the sitting president of the United States, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=768.62s)]
*  was supposedly still governing our country, still in charge of the nuclear codes, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=774.06s)]
*  who the Democrats have been saying now is cognitively unfit to run for a second term. And [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=778.38s)]
*  apparently no one wants to force him out because they don't care if a person is cognitively unfit [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=784.46s)]
*  as long as he's carrying out or able to carry out in his name their desires and orders. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=789.26s)]
*  If Joe Biden were three points in front of Donald Trump and likely to win, they would still be [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=794.7800000000001s)]
*  denying vehemently that there's anything wrong with Joe Biden. They would be attacking anyone [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=799.98s)]
*  who suggested that there was a spreading fake news. They didn't care at all if Joe Biden [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=804.38s)]
*  had a second term being senile and with dementia. They only care that they were concerned that he [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=809.98s)]
*  couldn't beat Trump. And so Joe Biden has been adamantly saying, as is the closest aid, no, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=815.98s)]
*  it's a lie that he's going to drop out. They were leaking that he was likely to drop out. They were [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=823.1800000000001s)]
*  saying this is an absolute lie. Biden himself was saying, he even said in an interview with [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=827.74s)]
*  George Stephanopoulos, there's nobody who can force me out of this race other than the Lord Almighty. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=831.98s)]
*  And already by then it was clear that a lot of top Democrats wanted him out and said, I don't care. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=837.58s)]
*  I'm going to keep running. I'm the people's choice. And then out of nowhere, no one knew he was going [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=841.42s)]
*  to do this. No one was consulted. There was a letter in Joe Biden's name posted to his Twitter [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=847.82s)]
*  account where he just wrote a generic letter explaining that he had come to believe it was [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=854.54s)]
*  better for the country for him not to run. And then a tweet issued in Joe Biden's name also in text [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=859.9s)]
*  form saying that not only am I dropping out, but I'm endorsing Kamala Harris. Now, you would [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=866.38s)]
*  obviously expect a sitting president of the United States who makes that kind of decision, which is [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=872.06s)]
*  very rarely made, to go on television and explain it, or at least simultaneously announce a time [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=877.74s)]
*  that night when they're going to go on television and explain their decision to the country, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=883.42s)]
*  given they're still the sitting president. That's what Lyndon Mings Johnson did in 1968 when he was [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=886.7s)]
*  expected to run for reelection. He realized that he couldn't because the anti-war sentiment, his [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=892.38s)]
*  own party against the Vietnam War and therefore against him, was so high that there was almost [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=898.62s)]
*  certainty that he couldn't get the nomination. There was very likely to be a grueling battle. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=903.42s)]
*  And of course, he didn't just issue a statement in his name. He went on to television and gave [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=908.22s)]
*  an address from the Oval Office, which is indicative of the significance of this sort of event. Joe Biden [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=912.06s)]
*  has not done that. Biden, there was a statement issued on Twitter in Biden's name, and then Biden [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=917.42s)]
*  disappeared. He hasn't been seen in public since then, let alone explained his decision in his own [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=924.3s)]
*  words. And yes, it's true that Biden has COVID, and that's why he's in Delaware self-isolating, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=931.02s)]
*  but his doctors over the last couple of days had told us that he was improving significantly. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=937.74s)]
*  But the bigger point is, if Joe Biden is too sick to get in front of a camera and explain his [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=945.98s)]
*  decision, then he's too sick to have made that decision. Or put another way, if Joe Biden is [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=952.5400000000001s)]
*  mentally and physically healthy enough to make a decision of that magnitude for him to be involved [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=958.0600000000001s)]
*  and conscious and to have thought through the implications and made a decision of that magnitude, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=964.7s)]
*  then he's physically and mentally well enough to go in front of a camera and explain why. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=970.22s)]
*  Now again, I don't believe and I'm not saying that Biden's in some basement somewhere tied up [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=977.34s)]
*  or that he's dead. I'm just saying that we are owed an explanation about why Biden made this [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=981.1s)]
*  decision after swearing repeatedly that he wouldn't. There's some accounts in the press [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=986.86s)]
*  from anonymous aides about why he made the decision, but absolutely nothing from Joe [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=992.94s)]
*  Biden himself. And of course, that's going to create a climate every day that goes by [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=997.26s)]
*  increasing strangeness and doubts and uncertainty about what happened. It feeds this narrative that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1002.7s)]
*  something very undemocratic took place. And although Biden sent his letter, I'm going to [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1007.8199999999999s)]
*  explain it to you in a few days. You can't do that. You can't be the president, make a decision of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1013.42s)]
*  this significance and then disappear from public entirely. Maybe he's angry about what he was [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1020.54s)]
*  forced to do. Maybe he's embarrassed, but he's still the president. Now he's safe with all that [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1028.22s)]
*  power in his hands and it's incredibly disturbing that we haven't heard from him. And every day [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1033.58s)]
*  that goes by, it's going to be even more so. Now I just wanted to talk briefly about Kamala Harris [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1038.54s)]
*  is almost certainly going to be the nominee in place of Joe Biden for president. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1043.74s)]
*  And the reason I say that is because Democrats follow their leaders, every sector of the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1050.78s)]
*  Democratic Party, the centrist and conservative part of the Democratic Party, the liberals, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1056.38s)]
*  and the left. Every faction is united always. They're always following in the footsteps of [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1061.42s)]
*  their leader. They're always doing what they're told. And so when Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1065.82s)]
*  or the Clintons, Hawking Jeffries comes out and say, we endorse Kamala Harris, when AOC does that, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1071.1s)]
*  when Elizabeth Warren does that, there's no doubt they're going to do what they're told and endorse [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1075.74s)]
*  Kamala Harris. And I think one of the things that's so bizarre about that is that Kamala Harris path [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1081.34s)]
*  to the White House was done without really any votes at all. She was barely elected from a [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1089.82s)]
*  blue state to become attorney general and then to the Senate. And she tried to be the president in [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1097.02s)]
*  2020. She had everything in her favor, huge amounts of money from California, incredibly [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1104.3s)]
*  favorable media coverage as the first black woman who might be president. The media loved Kamala [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1109.74s)]
*  Harris, and yet the voters hated her. She could barely get up to 2% in the polls. She had one [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1116.06s)]
*  good debate that Democrats thought she had when she basically implied Joe Biden was a [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1122.38s)]
*  segregationist and a racist who worked with Strom Thurmond to keep her out of [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1127.3400000000001s)]
*  integrated schools and other girls like her. But after that, Kelsey Gabbard destroyed her by pointing [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1133.42s)]
*  out she was a prosecutor who sent huge numbers of overwhelmingly black men to prison for low-level [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1139.0200000000002s)]
*  nonviolent drug crimes and worked hard to keep them there. And just in general, she was a mess. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1145.9s)]
*  And she pulled out of that race, never getting really more than 2% of the vote after that first [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1151.82s)]
*  debate. No black support, no support from really anyone and was forced to drop out. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1156.1399999999999s)]
*  She was then chosen by Joe Biden after he announced he would only choose a black woman [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1162.9399999999998s)]
*  as his vice president. There were two or three he could choose from. He picked her. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1168.1399999999999s)]
*  And now again, nobody voted for her to be the Democratic nominee. It was like a throwback [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1172.86s)]
*  to the 1950s and 60s when they used to choose the nominee in a back room. She was chosen by [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1179.26s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi and the Clintons and Obama and Chuck Schumer and Democratic billionaires. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1185.34s)]
*  And the reason she had to drop out of the race is because she was a terrible politician. Nobody [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1193.02s)]
*  liked her. Nobody was energized by her. And I think the most incredible thing to watch [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1197.98s)]
*  is all of these self-identified leftists who are loyal to the Democratic Party who have spent 10 [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1205.74s)]
*  months screaming that the Israeli war in Gaza is a genocide and that the Biden administration is [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1210.3s)]
*  complicit in it, responsible for it. They've been arming it. They've been funding it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1219.5s)]
*  And now when Joe Biden leaves the race, there's all these kinds of people keeping praise on him. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1225.02s)]
*  He was a great patriot who sacrificed for the good of the country, a great decent man, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1229.5s)]
*  as we've gone over before. But also, Kamala Harris was every bit as much on board with all of that. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1235.18s)]
*  There was never a moment where Kamala Harris indicated the slightest ideological political [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1239.5s)]
*  difference with not only Joe Biden, but the Democratic establishment itself, never once. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1246.14s)]
*  In fact, one of her first acts in the Senate when she was elected in 2016 was to introduce a [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1252.7s)]
*  resolution condemning the Obama administration's decision to abstain from a UN vote that allowed [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1258.86s)]
*  the UN to rule that Israel's occupation was illegal. Ordinarily, the US vetoes it. Obama [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1265.4199999999998s)]
*  didn't veto it. He abstained. And there was a Senate resolution to condemn Barack Obama from [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1271.98s)]
*  being insufficiently pro-Israel, and Kamala Harris was one of the main co-sponsors. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1276.46s)]
*  She's spoken at APAC. She has, if anything, been even more of a pro-establishment candidate [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1280.46s)]
*  than Joe Biden. And the one thing I will say that I think might be a difference between the two of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1285.9s)]
*  them, and it could be minor, but it could be significant, but it's certainly not in her favor, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1291.42s)]
*  is that at least Joe Biden, after spending 52 years of Washington, 40 years as a [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1296.14s)]
*  senator from Delaware trying to become president, eight years as vice president of our country, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1302.8600000000001s)]
*  president, eight years as vice president of Barack Obama, and now four years as a president, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1307.74s)]
*  built up enough self-belief, I guess you could say, is constantly talking about how there's [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1313.26s)]
*  nobody in the world who understands foreign policy better than he does. He has a self-belief that [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1318.86s)]
*  allows him on occasion to buck what he's told to do by the establishment, even though he never [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1323.02s)]
*  really does it for the good. But at least in theory, in like comportment, he's willing to do that. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1327.74s)]
*  Even the media, because he disbelieves himself so much, Kamala Harris is a novice. She knows nothing [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1334.06s)]
*  except how to be a lawyer. She knows nothing about foreign affairs or economic policy. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1341.66s)]
*  She's a completely empty vessel, a complete craven opportunist who does and says whatever she needs [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1346.46s)]
*  to to advance her career. She owes everything to the Democratic establishment. That's who let her [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1351.58s)]
*  win in California. That is who, after the debacle of our campaign, led to her being [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1359.98s)]
*  chosen as vice president, and now it's the Democratic establishment. Nobody else who plotted [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1365.9s)]
*  to force the Obama administration out of the race and put Kamala in that space and put Kamala in that [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1370.62s)]
*  space, and as a result, she's going to be more malleable than almost anyone to establish an [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1376.94s)]
*  interest in Washington, to the Democratic Party elite, to the deep state, to the U.S. security [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1383.9s)]
*  state. She has no confidence, rightly so, to understand any of those issues and to reject or [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1388.3s)]
*  do, to reject what she's being told to do. And I'm watching all these self-identified [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1393.6599999999999s)]
*  soft leftists who are loyal to the Democratic Party, twisting themselves into deceitful [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1400.22s)]
*  contortions. Different candidates, she's somehow better than Joe Biden or different than him [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1405.02s)]
*  ideologically. She's a complete craven tool of the establishment. They're going to use the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1410.86s)]
*  identity politics angle to make her seem like she's something new and refreshing. That's what [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1418.3799999999999s)]
*  identity politics is for, to take establishment figures like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1423.74s)]
*  and just say, look, they're a little different on the surface, but they're there to carry out [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1430.4599999999998s)]
*  status quo policies and make them seem new and different. Nobody bought that when Kamala Harris [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1436.7s)]
*  tried it in 2020 because she looks like the deputy general counsel for Exxon who just got out of a [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1441.82s)]
*  board meeting, and she's tried to adapt herself to speaking differently. I just don't think it's [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1449.42s)]
*  genuine, but I'm not a political pundit. All I'm saying is what I understand is the substance of [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1458.54s)]
*  policy and the idea that she's somehow going to be this new progressive figure or anti-establishment [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1462.3s)]
*  figure or better than or different than Joe Biden is a complete self-delusion. We need to see Joe [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1468.1399999999999s)]
*  Biden and explain in his own words why he chose to drop out of the race after swearing over and [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1474.46s)]
*  over that he wouldn't, why he chose to endorse Kamala Harris, why he thinks she's the best person [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1479.5s)]
*  for the job. We need to appreciate how anti-democratic the Democratic Party has been in all of its [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1484.54s)]
*  conduct internally and choosing their nominees since 2016 at least. And you're going to see a [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1491.74s)]
*  propaganda campaign on behalf of Kamala Harris to turn her into something that she isn't and has [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1499.82s)]
*  never been, the likes of which you haven't seen before. Already today they leaked. People close [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1504.22s)]
*  to Kamala Harris and the media went and not only mindlessly wrote it down, but got swooning and [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1510.54s)]
*  giggly about it that she called various Democratic allies today while wearing a Howard University [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1515.98s)]
*  sweatshirt and sweatpants. That's just the start of what they're going to try and turn her into [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1521.4199999999998s)]
*  because remember how desperate they are to ensure Donald Trump doesn't win. The media, they invented [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1528.1399999999999s)]
*  all kinds of scandal, the Russiagate hoax, all sorts of other things that Hunter Biden is reporting [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1533.34s)]
*  being Russian disinformation. They try to impeach Trump and then put him in prison just to add to [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1539.1799999999998s)]
*  the anti-democratic bony thities of the Democratic Party and their establishment media allies. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1546.94s)]
*  Engaging in pure hagiography and propaganda on behalf of Kamala Harris is something you don't [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1553.5s)]
*  have to have any doubt they're about to engage in in the most embarrassingly extreme, worshipful, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1557.8200000000002s)]
*  and deceitful way. Those are a few of my thoughts. I'm sure I'm going to have some others, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1564.22s)]
*  which I might wait until I get back in order to share further. But like I said, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1569.18s)]
*  if something really significant happens, I will weigh in again. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqxUo9ZmBW4&t=1572.54s)]
