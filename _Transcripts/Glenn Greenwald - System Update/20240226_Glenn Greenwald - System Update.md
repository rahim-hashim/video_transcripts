# Top Colombia Advisor on Historic Left-Wing Govt, Drug War, & More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM)
*  We speak to one of the most important and influential figures in Columbia, where all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=0.0s)]
*  sorts of complex and interesting and revealing political debates are unfolding. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=11.68s)]
*  In 2022, that country elected its first left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, after decades of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=16.28s)]
*  right-wing leaders that were highly loyal to the United States and followed the same [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=22.56s)]
*  ideological path. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=26.68s)]
*  The person who is Petro's closest advisor, the Spanish newspaper El País called him [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=28.32s)]
*  Petro's Apostle, is Gustavo Bolivar. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=33.68s)]
*  He is actually best known as an author of critically acclaimed and internationally well-read [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=37.24s)]
*  novels, most notably the international bestseller, quote, without tits there is no paradise. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=41.64s)]
*  I think it sounds less crude in Spanish, but that's the translation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  He was elected to the Columbia Senate in 2018. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=50.84s)]
*  He is now a central figure in the presidency of President Petro. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=53.8s)]
*  We spoke about here in the studio the reasons why Petro was elected, why he has suffered [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=57.68s)]
*  a pretty significant drop in popularity in such a short period of time, how Columbia's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=63.56s)]
*  strategy for dealing with drug gangs and international drug traffickers, namely by forging a peace [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=68.24s)]
*  deal with the leading drug gang FARC, compares with the far more violent and aggressive approach [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=73.62s)]
*  taken by the highly popular president of El Salvador, why President Petro was one of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=79.56s)]
*  war in Gaza, whether it matters to Latin American countries like Columbia, which of the two [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=85.32s)]
*  political parties run Washington, and much more about the political scene in Columbia, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=89.8s)]
*  how that affects the region and the United States. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=94.44s)]
*  Latin America has always been crucial to American foreign policy given its proximity to our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  continent and Columbia has long been one of the most influential countries in that region, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=101.56s)]
*  both for other Latin American countries and for the US. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  I found Bolivar, who's visiting Brazil here in Rio and was inside of our studio, to be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=109.72s)]
*  a very sophisticated and illuminating analyst of the situation in Columbia, but also the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=114.4s)]
*  broader geopolitical situation in which that country finds itself and I'm very confident [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=119.92s)]
*  you will view it in the same way. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=124.28s)]
*  In the last few years, the presidents of Columbia were on the right, always well allied [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=139.64s)]
*  with the United States and in 2022, finally, after many years, Columbia elected the first [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  president of the left, President Petro. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=154.2s)]
*  What is the meaning of this change? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=157.72s)]
*  Well, Columbia was the only country in Latin America that had never been governed by [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  the left. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=169.52s)]
*  The left had never governed in Columbia in more than 207 years of independence. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=170.52s)]
*  So what does it mean that we are aligned with the continent in a new wave of progressive [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=176.96s)]
*  governments, along with Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, which was hit hard by a soft blow, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  but it was also progressive, Ecuador, etc. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=191.44s)]
*  The only country that was missing for having a progressive government was Columbia. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=197.2s)]
*  For us, it is very important because Columbia is a country that is going through an era of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  violence and that violence was caused by a confrontation between guerrillas and paramilitaries. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=206.0s)]
*  The state of Columbia has been intervened by the drug trafficking mafia and to this day, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=213.92s)]
*  Even in control entities, it is proven that there is interference in drug trafficking in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=222.92s)]
*  many control entities such as the prosecutor's office, the prosecutor's office and in past [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=228.64s)]
*  governments there was also. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=234.56s)]
*  Why did Columbia's people, after so many years, voting on the right, voting on the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  right, voting on the right, suddenly elect a president of the left? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=243.88s)]
*  What happens is that the right has reached levels of abuse that people no longer tolerate, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=250.52s)]
*  especially during the social explosion, in which due to the pandemic, due to a tax reform [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=258.36s)]
*  that the Iván Duque government tried to introduce to aggravate food, put IVA on food, it made [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=265.6s)]
*  people explode and go out into the streets, a people with a lot of inequality, one of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=274.32s)]
*  the most unequal on earth, with a lot of hunger, that the government wanted to impose an unfair [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  tribute on them, they went out to protest and the government's response was violent, it was [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  a terrible repression that left more than 100 young people without eyes, more than 83 [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=292.12s)]
*  dead, many missing, violations, that police abuse, the state of the government, tolerated [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=299.68s)]
*  by the government, that's what made people think it was time to abandon the right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=308.64s)]
*  Colombia, I think, is still mostly a country of rights, but it has already reached the limit, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=314.4s)]
*  let's say, of violence and that made people vote for the left. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=322.44s)]
*  From the perspective of Americans, as Americans, the central fact of Colombia is always that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  Colombia was one of the strongest allies of the United States. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=335.12s)]
*  The United States also had a great involvement in its country, with military bases and others, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=340.88s)]
*  a way to influence Colombia. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=348.88s)]
*  Did that change or will it change with President Petro? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  It won't change much. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=356.4s)]
*  The thing is that the United States knows that Colombia is strategic in Latin America. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=358.32s)]
*  They always told us that we were the Israel of Latin America, because we have always been [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=363.08s)]
*  their ally, both in the commercial and military. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=369.16s)]
*  It won't change because precisely the United States government has allowed Gustavo Petro [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=372.56s)]
*  to express himself freely. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=383.04s)]
*  For example, in the subject of what is happening in Gaza, Gustavo Petro was the first [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=384.12s)]
*  president of the world who raised his voice to protest against the genocide, not to say [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=392.08s)]
*  of the Israeli people, but of Netanyahu, President Netanyahu against the people of Gaza. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=397.64s)]
*  And in passing, he blamed the powers that are supporting this genocide. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=404.32s)]
*  And Gustavo Petro has had the interest of standing up also against the United States. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  In some things we are friends, but there are things in which he does not kneel, as other [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=415.68s)]
*  presidents, and he has his own voice. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=421.68s)]
*  Although we depend commercially on the United States, we also have very large military [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=424.32s)]
*  aid annually, of which we cannot be without, because we still have problems with guerrillas, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=430.88s)]
*  with violence, with paramilitarism. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=436.88s)]
*  I was going to ask about this so clearly denounced by the president against the Israel war. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=440.24s)]
*  Why was it so important that the Colombian president denounced the war against Israel, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=449.24s)]
*  even though the United States is financing this war, is well supporting Israel, giving [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=456.44s)]
*  the bombs? Why was it so important for the president to do that? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=462.36s)]
*  The thing is that President Biden has a difficult scenario because it is an electoral year. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=466.92s)]
*  He cannot go against the Jews, who are the ones who finance the campaigns, who put the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=473.08s)]
*  money into the campaigns, but when he goes against the Muslims, that is to say, when he does not [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=477.68s)]
*  censor Netanyahu's genocide, he is losing the Muslim vote within the United States. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=481.96s)]
*  And although they do not believe it, President Petro, who has a great rise among Muslims [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=491.92s)]
*  today from all over the world, let's say that the Muslims, because of the position of President [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=496.88s)]
*  Petro, are loving Gustavo Petro very much. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=501.96s)]
*  I could, with a wink of Gustavo Petro, help even in the election of President Biden, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=505.12s)]
*  because there we have to, among a Donald Trump who hates Petro, in his campaign he mentioned it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=510.28s)]
*  and spoke horrible things about Petro, and a Biden, because we have to choose the least [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=516.76s)]
*  and obviously President Biden is working hand in hand with Gustavo Petro. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=522.04s)]
*  He has received him four times this first year of government, four times, the two presidents [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=526.6s)]
*  and we say that the relationship is flowing and we have to choose between Trump and Biden. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=532.12s)]
*  That's what I wanted to ask. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  In 2019 I interviewed the Vice President of Bolivia, Ivan Rades, and it was soon after [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=539.0s)]
*  the coup, he was married to Mexico, I went to Mexico to interview him, and I asked him, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=548.0400000000001s)]
*  is there a big difference, not for Americans, but for Bolivia, for America and China, between [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=553.72s)]
*  the two parties in the United States, Democrats, Republicans, Clinton, Obama, Bush, Trump, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=560.44s)]
*  and Ivan Rades told me that there is no difference in the perspective of Bolivia, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=567.72s)]
*  of America and China, that he is the same pastor of the United States. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=577.64s)]
*  There really shouldn't be a difference, but in our case there is, because it is that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=581.16s)]
*  Donald Trump already has Gustavo Petro in his sights. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  In the past he even wrote on his Twitter something about Gustavo Petro. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  So between a president who receives Gustavo Petro four times in a year, at home, and a [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=595.0s)]
*  president who does not want Gustavo Petro for us, who depend commercially on the United [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=603.4000000000001s)]
*  States, there is a big difference. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=607.0s)]
*  Let's say that ideologically, perhaps what President Evo Morales meant was that one [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=608.2800000000001s)]
*  does not notice a difference between Republicans and Democrats in terms of the vision they [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  have of geopolitics in Latin America. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  They always apply it the same way. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=621.24s)]
*  They want to intervene, they want to be there, to have their bases, they want to take advantage [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=622.7600000000001s)]
*  of natural resources. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  That does not change, but politically we do have a big difference. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=628.84s)]
*  We prefer to continue with President Biden. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=633.72s)]
*  In Ecuador, when Rafael Correa was president of Ecuador, I remember the controversy, kind [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=636.84s)]
*  of funny, when he demanded that the United States leave the country with the military [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=644.12s)]
*  base. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=652.44s)]

*  the United States from its country? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=674.2s)]
*  Well, these are different cases. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=676.2s)]
*  What happens is that we, for being the first time that they govern the left, President [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=678.6s)]
*  Petro has been very careful to make that transition very slow and has not wanted to break with [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=684.0400000000001s)]
*  the United States or with countries that are not affiliated with them because, let's say, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  the country is still being right-wing, the big media are still on the right, the economic [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=697.24s)]
*  groups are on the right. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=702.12s)]
*  We are exposed to a very easy coup d'état, the military have been indoctrinated for the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=703.64s)]
*  right all their lives. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=709.24s)]
*  We have a fragile government and if we can give very strong bandages, let's say very [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=710.2s)]
*  strong changes, we can suddenly cause a coup d'état. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=715.32s)]
*  President Petro has been walking on a knife trail, as if he cannot be turned away from [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=719.64s)]
*  anywhere, he has to do it and he has done it very intelligently. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=727.0s)]
*  Let's say it has been more pragmatism because I know that from within he would like to do [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=730.36s)]
*  something else. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=736.12s)]
*  But he has been intelligent to keep himself from making a total revolution in a first [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=736.92s)]
*  government. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=742.84s)]
*  That is why we say that the party that led Gustavo Petro to the presidency is the historical [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=743.3199999999999s)]
*  party and we would like to have more governments of the historical party and that is decided [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=748.6800000000001s)]
*  in 2026. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=753.24s)]

*  supremely conservative country, he has wanted to keep, let's say, the status quo but not [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=759.4s)]
*  to finish it because that could generate what happened in other countries in some coups of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=767.08s)]
*  state. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=772.44s)]
*  To ask one more thing about Ecuador, which is a country that has many problems now, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=773.56s)]
*  including this very serious violence against the state. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=781.0799999999999s)]
*  There were presidential candidates who were murdered, who were attacked. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=785.3199999999999s)]
*  Now we are seeing even more violence against the state. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=789.24s)]
*  Colombia has a history with many similar problems, with gangs, drug trafficking, all of [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=794.12s)]
*  this. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=802.52s)]
*  I also know that the president has already received many death threats during his campaign, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=802.9200000000001s)]
*  now during his presidency. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=810.12s)]
*  How is the situation of the presidency now and also the possibility of having the same [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=812.12s)]
*  problems that are happening in Ecuador? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=819.4s)]
*  Ecuador is going through a problem that we had a few years ago, which we are just [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=822.84s)]
*  seeing, which is drug trafficking. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=830.52s)]
*  I attribute Ecuador's violence problems to the dollarization of the economy. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=832.52s)]
*  And Argentina can go through it because when you dollarize the economy of a country, the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=836.52s)]
*  drug trafficker no longer has to wash dollars. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=842.84s)]
*  He has no more, he reaches paradise, perfect, that happened to Panama, Colombia has not [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=845.88s)]
*  dollarized, that is why drug trafficking finances are so difficult in Colombia because [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=851.32s)]
*  they have to bring people to change money, to wash it practically. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=856.28s)]
*  The countries that dollarize become washers and there is a perfect nest for drug trafficking [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=860.28s)]
*  to be born. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=867.4799999999999s)]
*  And if we see this last violent incursion in Ecuador, it happened because they are drug [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=869.4799999999999s)]
*  traffickers, drug traffickers are forced. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=875.4799999999999s)]
*  Politically, the election of a progressive, because I think this lady, Luisa, was going [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=878.44s)]
*  to win, but they cause a murder of a candidate who had no possibility to blame the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=888.44s)]
*  left, exactly, President Correa and they skillfully achieve that a candidate who did not [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=896.9200000000001s)]
*  represent the vice president. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=903.96s)]
*  All those tricks, all those tricks are capable of making the right to return to power. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=905.96s)]
*  So, although the president has expressed to President Petro, he has expressed solidarity [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=911.96s)]
*  to the president of Ecuador for the events, even Colombia, which has specialized in [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=917.96s)]
*  military intelligence, in police intelligence, has offered him collaboration to disarticulate [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=923.96s)]
*  the country, but we do not have an ideological affinity with the president of Ecuador. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=930.2s)]
*  I want to understand a little about your role in the current government of Colombia with [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=934.2s)]
*  President Petro. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=940.2s)]
*  There are many magazines in Colombia, but also others internationally, which obviously [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=942.2s)]
*  the gentleman is well known as an actor, his books are very read internationally, but [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=948.2s)]
*  there is also this political side and there are all the magazines that say that the gentleman [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=954.44s)]
*  is the closest and most important advisor to President Petro, even the country says [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=962.44s)]
*  that the gentleman is the opposite of the president. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=968.44s)]
*  How would you describe your role in the government and with the president? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=972.44s)]
*  When social networks appear, last decade, and these demonstrations are presented, first [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=978.6800000000001s)]
*  in Spain, the 15M in Spain, and then the Arab Spring that is developed by Twitter, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=986.6800000000001s)]
*  I become very strong on social networks, as in 2011, I organized a movement of indignant [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  movements, of corruption in Colombia, and in 2015 I am going to live in the United States [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1002.92s)]
*  and from there I offer President Petro an economic help so that he continues to exercise [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1008.92s)]
*  the policy because the prosecutor has just dismissed him, it continues to happen, today [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1016.92s)]
*  the prosecutor's office dismisses ministers every day, the prosecutor of the time Gustavo [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1022.92s)]
*  Petro is dismissed for a garbage issue, he takes away his salary, he has been persecuted [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1029.16s)]
*  for many years, so as an indignant I tell him that we can gather money so that he continues [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1035.16s)]
*  to exercise, he tells me that he does not need it for now and in 2017 he looks for me to [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1039.16s)]
*  tell me that now he does need help, he wants to apply for presidency, so I know him [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1045.16s)]
*  for the first time in 2017, I go, I am with him and he tells me that he wants people like [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1051.16s)]
*  me to be in the Senate, he accepts me to be on the list, at that moment I did not accept him [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1057.4s)]
*  because I was living in the United States, I already had my green card and I knew I could [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1061.4s)]
*  have problems, but in the end they convinced me and I was the biggest vote of the left in [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1065.4s)]
*  the Senate at that time, in 2000 we did the presidential campaign, Gustavo Petro lost [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1071.4s)]
*  in 2018 and by 2022 he re-elected me to the Senate, I was re-elected to the Senate and [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1077.4s)]
*  he was president, but last year I resigned from the Senate to be a candidate for the [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1083.64s)]
*  mayor of Bogotá, but my proximity to him has been very close, let's say a person [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1087.64s)]
*  who listens to me, listens to me a lot and let's say that there is also a relationship [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1095.64s)]
*  of affection, of friendship, yes. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1101.64s)]
*  I remember well when he was elected in 2022, I think the country, the people were very [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1105.88s)]
*  excited, at least because every change is excited for a country, but from that moment [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1115.88s)]
*  when he was elected, his approval is falling, sometimes falling quickly, I think he [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1123.88s)]
*  has approval from the population of 30%, 35%, very fast this fall, how do you explain [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1132.1200000000001s)]
*  this? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1140.1200000000001s)]
*  There are internal and external factors, in the internal there have been family scandals, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  they cannot be hidden, difficult to sort, the son, this is the son who is involved in [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1148.1200000000001s)]
*  the corruption. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1156.12s)]
*  The main thing is to take away the health business, take away the pension business, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1186.36s)]
*  which is gigantic, is to ask all those economic groups to pay the workers well, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1190.36s)]
*  to pay these hours and that affects those groups and those groups are the owners of [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1196.36s)]
*  the five major media that are in Colombia, there are only two television channels and [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1200.36s)]
*  both channels are in the hands of two large economic groups, so the campaign [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1204.36s)]
*  that they have done to Gustavo Petro since day one, which was in the presidency, today [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1210.6s)]
*  it is 18 months, it was 18 months yesterday, it has been gigantic and we have no way [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1216.6s)]
*  to counteract with our communications that manipulation of the media, because they are [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1222.6s)]
*  gigantic, they are the channels of tradition, the big press, the big magazines and although [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1228.6s)]
*  alternative media collaborate with us. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1234.6s)]
*  But this propaganda did not work during the campaign because it was right, so [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1236.84s)]
*  how did the people change the idea about it so quickly? I imagine that the media [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1242.84s)]
*  was against it during the campaign too. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1248.84s)]
*  In Colombia there has always been electoral fraud, and in 2018 we believe that there was [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1250.84s)]
*  fraud, I do not have the evidence. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1256.84s)]
*  I think it won, it already won in 2018. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1258.84s)]
*  So for 2022 we said, we have the people, the demonstrations of Gustavo Petro were [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1263.08s)]
*  huge, huge, it filled more than 100 places, we knew we had to win, we were going to [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1269.08s)]
*  take care of the elections, so we dedicated ourselves to making an electoral defense [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1277.08s)]
*  post by post with electoral witnesses because we knew that if we covered all the [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1281.08s)]
*  positions, they could not steal the elections and the proof is that this time we won and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1285.08s)]
*  we won because we had how to defend the votes, in 2018 we did not have a good electoral [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1291.32s)]
*  defense. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1297.32s)]
*  But the popularity has declined first because of internal scandals, second because [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1299.32s)]
*  social reforms have not been well explained by us because we do not have the means to [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1305.32s)]
*  explain them and they, the owners of the groups explain them in their own way, we are going [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1311.32s)]
*  to end up with health, we are going to end up with pensions and they begin to generate [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1315.32s)]
*  false stories that fall between the population because we have no way to counter that. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1319.56s)]
*  Difficult. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1325.56s)]
*  During the campaign that caught my attention, I said the central theme, maybe a [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1327.56s)]
*  little exaggerated, but a very emphasized theme of this candidate, now president, is [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1333.56s)]
*  that our great enemy is neoliberalism, which is a theme that is actually [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1341.8s)]
*  internationally very popular, not only on the left but also on the right-wing populist [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1347.8s)]
*  in the context of Colombia, what does that mean and can you make progress in the [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1353.8s)]
*  fight against neoliberalism? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1361.8s)]
*  Colombia in the 90s was walking on a path of industrialization, when neoliberalism [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1366.04s)]
*  arrives in 1993 with a president named Cesar Gaviria and allows imports of all types of [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1376.04s)]
*  products without arancels to the country, the industrialization project ends, it was [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1384.04s)]
*  cheaper for us to buy outside than to buy inside. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1390.04s)]
*  That made unemployment grow, poverty grow and neoliberalism was very abusive [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1394.28s)]
*  because they even wanted to negotiate with the rights of the people, that was Gustavo [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1402.28s)]
*  Petruz's speech, you can't negotiate with my right to health, you can't give me [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1408.28s)]
*  a commodity, if I'm sick you can't tell me not to take care of myself because I don't [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1412.28s)]
*  have insurance, so universalize health. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1418.28s)]
*  So our campaign focused on the state having an essential role, not in those [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1420.52s)]
*  old-fashioned states that had even airlines and they drove trains and everything, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1428.52s)]
*  but at least in three essential lines the state has to intervene, which is health, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1434.52s)]
*  education, which they also turned into a business, and basic sanitation, water services. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1440.52s)]
*  Because if the state doesn't intervene in these sectors, the marketer, the neoliberal [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1448.76s)]
*  will always be doing business and that's what the Colombian state did in the last [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1454.76s)]
*  decades, sell people to private companies. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1458.76s)]
*  So the private company that has to lend me a health service, well, lends it to me [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1460.76s)]
*  very cheap, very bad because it needs to have a profit and have a high profit margin [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1466.76s)]
*  and in that sense we said we have to take away from the private companies the health [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1470.76s)]
*  and we're going to do it from the state. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1477.0s)]
*  How? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1479.0s)]
*  By eliminating private intermediations, because how it works in Colombia is that the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1481.0s)]
*  government turns to intermediaries called EPSs and the EPSs pay hospitals and [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1487.0s)]
*  clinics, they get a good rate. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1492.0s)]
*  We want this rate to disappear and the state to directly turn to hospitals and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1495.0s)]
*  clinics, even private ones, no matter if they're private. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1499.0s)]
*  A little more about the violence of the drug traffickers, because obviously Colombia [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1503.24s)]
*  made history in this peace agreement with the largest gang in Colombia, which is [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1509.24s)]
*  FARC, and at the same time now in Salvador, Salvador has a president who was elected [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1517.24s)]
*  king, who is evidently very popular, choosing a completely different path, I don't know [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1525.24s)]
*  what I mean, a completely different path, that is, he doesn't want to make any peace [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1531.48s)]
*  agreements with the gangs, but he wants to destroy, he wants to attack, he wants to use [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1535.48s)]
*  violence from the state, very serious, very hard. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1539.48s)]
*  What can we understand about these two paths, going to Colombia and the agreement [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1543.48s)]
*  made with FARC and other gangs, also the path to Salvador? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1551.48s)]
*  The violence of Salvador and Colombia are different. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1557.72s)]
*  We are dealing with guerrilla groups that have been in the jungle for five decades. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1559.72s)]
*  Salvador is a very small country, very easy to control. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1565.72s)]
*  Colombia is a country with a part of the Amazon, with giant mountains, it is very [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1567.72s)]
*  difficult to find guerrillas or paramilitaries. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1573.72s)]
*  So we have to, to make a lasting peace, which is not what Bukele is doing, Bukele [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1577.72s)]
*  is making an ephemeral peace, because it is based on the violation of human rights, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1583.96s)]
*  it is based on repression, it is not generating, we have the conditions so that these [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1587.96s)]
*  people stop. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1593.96s)]
*  It is super popular, of course, because it is effective. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1595.96s)]
*  When one violates human rights, it is very effective, because that is from one day [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1597.96s)]
*  to the next. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1601.96s)]
*  It violates the constitution, it sends it to hell, it throws it in the trash, and it [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1603.96s)]
*  starts to catch all these people. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1607.96s)]
*  When we do that, the response of the guerrilla groups, which are much more [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1610.2s)]
*  aggressive than a gang, will be of total violence, and we will certainly put the [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1614.2s)]
*  country in a much bigger war. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1620.2s)]
*  So we have to be careful that this total peace that Gustavo Petro uses, so that [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1622.2s)]
*  it is lasting, has some bases of social justice. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1628.2s)]
*  Because what we have to look at is why those guerrillas were born, or why those [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1632.2s)]
*  paramilitaries were born. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1636.44s)]
*  And most of those young people who are part of the paramilitary and guerrilla groups [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1638.44s)]
*  come from places in Colombia where there is no education, there is no health, there are [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1642.44s)]
*  no employment opportunities, very difficult possibilities for them, they have no [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1648.44s)]
*  way out. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1654.44s)]
*  So if we subsist on those social imbalances, lack of work, lack of education, lack of [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1656.44s)]
*  employment, it will certainly be more difficult for more guerrillas and paramilitaries to [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1662.68s)]
*  be born. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1666.68s)]
*  That takes 10, 20 years. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1668.68s)]
*  It is not effective and it is not popular. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1670.68s)]
*  But it will be more lasting. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1672.68s)]
*  It is possible that when Colombia reaches a lasting peace, El Salvador will be [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1674.68s)]
*  having a rebound of violence again, because what generates human rights violations are [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1678.68s)]
*  chains of revenge, of violence. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1682.68s)]
*  And that will explode at some point. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1684.68s)]
*  I think that Brazil did more or less the same thing as Colombia with the traffickers, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1686.92s)]
*  with the gangs, also with the militiamen here. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1694.92s)]
*  That is, it didn't try to make war against them, destroy them, but more or less accepted [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1698.92s)]
*  that they exist, trying to make almost an agreement between the government and this [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1706.92s)]
*  other government. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1712.92s)]
*  And many times I thought about the war lesson of the other countries, the United States [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1715.16s)]
*  with the war against terror and all the wars that the United States does, also the war [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1723.16s)]
*  against Israel, because every time the police in Brazil, the military in Brazil, try to [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1727.16s)]
*  invade the gangs and kill the traffickers, it creates a lot of anger from the operation [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1733.16s)]
*  against the government and goes to the traffickers. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1739.16s)]
*  Do you think there are lessons that we can learn from this problem of the traffickers, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1743.4s)]
*  the gang traffickers and the wars that Israel is doing in Palestine or the United States [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1751.4s)]
*  is doing with many countries? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1757.4s)]
*  The drug trafficking is a lost war. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1761.4s)]
*  We have to start from there. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1763.4s)]
*  And that is what the president understands. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1765.4s)]
*  That is why one of the first projects that we passed in Congress was the legalization [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1767.64s)]
*  of marijuana. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1771.64s)]
*  I even went there, I presented in the Senate a bill to legalize cocaine. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1773.64s)]
*  Our big problems are crossed by drug trafficking and those of Latin America, those of violence [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1781.64s)]
*  in Latin America. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1785.64s)]
*  The only way to solve them is by legalizing drugs. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1787.64s)]
*  There is no other way. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1791.64s)]
*  I want to ask you, when alcohol was provided, it created gangs that were very violent. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1793.88s)]
*  What was the solution to this? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1799.88s)]
*  The legalization of alcohol again. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1801.88s)]
*  So we have this example. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1803.88s)]
*  Because if the young people who are the ones who are involved in drug trafficking, in fact [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1807.88s)]
*  the average age of a drug trafficker is 40 years old, they never reach old people, they [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1813.88s)]
*  kill them. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1817.88s)]
*  The young people and the growers, both of the coca leaf and the marijuana leaf, are [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1820.1200000000001s)]
*  no longer victims, but victims. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1826.1200000000001s)]
*  This is what Gustavo Petro says. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1830.1200000000001s)]
*  Gustavo Petro says, whoever sows coca or sows marijuana is not a victim, but a victim [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1832.1200000000001s)]
*  of drug trafficking. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1836.1200000000001s)]
*  So what he has said is, we are going to substitute the crops for legal businesses. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  We wanted it to be for marijuana, because if I substitute coca leaf for legal marijuana, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1844.1200000000001s)]
*  they surely maintain their income levels and they do not have to sacrifice their family income. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1848.36s)]
*  Because the great profit is not left between the peasants and the young people who sell [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1856.36s)]
*  the drugs. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1860.36s)]
*  The great profit is left between those who trade the drugs internationally, in this case [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1862.36s)]
*  today the Mexicans. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1866.36s)]
*  The Mexicans, in the golden age of drug trafficking in Colombia, were employees of the cartels [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1868.36s)]
*  of Colombia, but they learned and now they are the owners of the business. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1874.6s)]
*  Now the Colombians are the employees of the Mexicans. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1878.6s)]
*  Because, let's say, a kilo of coca in Colombia can be sold for a thousand dollars. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1880.6s)]
*  If you put it in Mexico, it is worth 15,000. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1886.6s)]
*  And if you put it in New York, it is worth 40,000. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1890.6s)]
*  And if you put it in Europe, it is worth 60,000. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1892.6s)]
*  And if you put it in China, it is worth 100,000. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1894.6s)]
*  So what the high profit margin gives is international trafficking. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1896.6s)]
*  That is what the Mexicans learned to do. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1902.84s)]
*  So we are in a very difficult scenario because while Gustavo Petro disarms some criminal [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1904.84s)]
*  gangs, others are already being born. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1912.84s)]
*  If drug trafficking is not legalized, if drugs are not legalized, that problem will never [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1914.84s)]
*  have an end because the profits are so great that there will always be a poor young man [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1918.84s)]
*  willing to give his life for a few years of opulence or welfare. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1924.84s)]
*  And just one last question. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1931.08s)]
*  Is there a possibility that the president or the government could persuade the population [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1933.08s)]
*  to accept legalization as the only way out of violence? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1941.08s)]
*  The measure of legalization in Colombia is still not popular. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1947.08s)]
*  As I told you, Colombia is a very conservative country. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1951.08s)]
*  But there has been, let's say, in 2018, 63% disagreed with legalizing. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1953.08s)]
*  Today it is like 54% more or less. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1959.32s)]
*  It has been going down. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1963.32s)]
*  And because we have given the arguments, people already understand that it is like that. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1965.32s)]
*  For example, in the time of Pablo Escobar, Colombia exported 600 kilos, 600 tons of cocaine. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1969.32s)]
*  Today 1,400. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1979.32s)]
*  Pablo Escobar died and that continued as if nothing had happened. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1981.32s)]
*  The business continued to grow despite the arrival of the Colombia Plan, which was a strong [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1985.56s)]
*  investment of North American money, almost 10 billion dollars. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1989.56s)]
*  Colombia invested another more than 100 billion and there have been more than 400 billion dead. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1993.56s)]
*  And this continues to grow. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=1999.56s)]
*  But I say it is a lost war. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2001.56s)]
*  If I, with 400 billion dead and more than 150 billion dollars invested in that war, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2003.56s)]
*  I have as a result that there is more production, more crops, more consumers. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2009.8s)]
*  This is because the war was lost. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2015.8s)]
*  And the world has to understand that. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2017.8s)]
*  Above all, it has to be understood at the Vienna Convention very soon. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2019.8s)]
*  So the proposal that we made to the government is that if there are five progressive governments [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2021.8s)]
*  that have to do with drug trafficking, make a block, what Mexico is, at that time there was [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2027.8s)]
*  Chile, Brazil, Colombia, make a block and arrive with a position of legalization in Vienna, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2034.04s)]
*  where the convention is held every year. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2040.04s)]
*  Because individually we did not achieve it. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2044.04s)]
*  Bolivia has fought to make it a block. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2046.04s)]
*  They are like a block, a group. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2048.04s)]
*  A block, exactly. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2050.04s)]
*  A progressive Latin American block of legalization. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2052.04s)]
*  Everyone agrees on that. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2054.04s)]
*  And they already met in Cali last year, those Latin American presidents, and I think that [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2056.04s)]
*  will happen soon. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2062.2799999999997s)]
*  We will fight with a block that we could not do before. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2064.2799999999997s)]
*  So Colombia is a very interesting country and the interview was also very interesting. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2066.2799999999997s)]
*  We have many more questions, unfortunately we do not have more time. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2074.2799999999997s)]
*  But thank you very much for the interview. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2078.2799999999997s)]
*  I thank you and I hope we can talk again. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2082.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you for the invitation. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2088.52s)]
*  It is an honor to be in front of a journalist who won Pulitzer. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2090.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2092.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4cZXl7KtM&t=2094.52s)]
