# How Douglas Murray and Konstantin Kisin Weaponize “Expertise”
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds)
*  All right, next question from Curl Malone who says, quote, I've been watching Douglas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=0.0s)]
*  Murray, Sam Harris, and Constantine Kissin make arguments for expertise and standards [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=12.98s)]
*  since the Wizard of Oz moment Murray inflicted on the Joe Rogan podcast with Dave Smith. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=19.14s)]
*  I'm curious what you think generally about this story. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=23.66s)]
*  I definitely followed all of this with a great deal of interest. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=27.82s)]
*  And what I found so notable about it is that the people you named, Douglas Murray, Sam [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=32.94s)]
*  Harris, Constantine Kissin, are all people who have basically created careers and thrived [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=39.46s)]
*  within independent media. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=46.14s)]
*  And one of the kind of defining ethos of independent media, a flag I've raised myself [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=49.5s)]
*  before, is that the scope of the voices that corporate media believes is worthy of being [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=59.22s)]
*  heard is extremely narrow. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=66.1s)]
*  Even when they're giving you, quote, unquote, experts, they're not just randomly finding [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=69.42s)]
*  experts on a topic and then seeing what they have to say. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  They're choosing them based on the agenda and the narrative they want to promote. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=75.76s)]
*  I don't know many people who have more in-depth expertise on international relations than [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Professor John Mearsheimer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=86.84s)]
*  When was the last time you saw him, quote, in the New York Times or the Washington Post, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=87.84s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal, or on NBC or CBS analyzing world events? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=92.84s)]
*  He doesn't have the right narrative. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=96.84s)]
*  It's not a question of credentials. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=98.04s)]
*  And part of the idea of why we need independent media is precisely because corporate media [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=100.84s)]
*  selects a tiny range of voices and a tiny range of views that can be heard and they [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=105.7s)]
*  have a very stifled sense of what expertise is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=110.34s)]
*  And the idea of independent media was like, hey, no, ordinary citizens deserve to be heard [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=116.1s)]
*  too. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=120.38s)]
*  A lot of times they have an understanding of things or a view of things which is more [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=121.38s)]
*  informed and more valuable than the, quote, so-called experts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=127.1s)]
*  I really try hard not to fall into romanticization of working class people or people who haven't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=133.06s)]
*  gone to elite schools because every group of people has their flaws and their bad characteristics. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  And when you start to idealize the working class as this group of people with wisdom [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=147.94s)]
*  and superior empathy or knowledge or whatever, it's always a little bit manipulative in its [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=154.34s)]
*  own right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=160.46s)]
*  I'm sorry for the mirror image of romanticizing elite, idealized professors. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  But I did have this experience once where, and I'm sorry for how trite this sounds, but [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=166.86s)]
*  it really did happen and it really was illustrative for me. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=171.54000000000002s)]
*  I was in Milwaukee in a kind of suburb just outside of Milwaukee, like a very working [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=173.9s)]
*  class suburb. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  And again, I'm sorry for the cliche, but I was sitting in a diner. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=182.84s)]
*  I was having lunch. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  At the next table was a group of five guys who were on their lunch break. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  They were in labor uniforms. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=193.1s)]
*  I don't know exactly what they did, but they were in their work uniforms. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=195.89999999999998s)]
*  And it happened to be at the time when the Intercept got involved in a big scandal because [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=201.05999999999997s)]
*  the Intercept had received this document from a source who turned out to be a reality winner [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=207.14s)]
*  purporting that the Russians had sought to invade the electoral system in ways we previously [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=212.46s)]
*  didn't know. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=218.46s)]
*  And then the Intercept made a bunch of mistakes that led to the detection of reality winner. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=219.76s)]
*  Anyway, on their phones they would get New York Times headlines. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=223.62s)]
*  There was a big New York Times headline on that story, on what the Intercept did with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=227.06s)]
*  the source. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=230.34s)]
*  And they were talking about it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=232.06s)]
*  Again, not because they were reading the Intercept, but because they were getting the New York [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=233.46s)]
*  Times headline on their phone. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=236.34s)]
*  And there was a big story about that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  Obviously they had no idea I was sitting at the table next to them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=239.38s)]
*  And I remember them saying, this is what they said. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=243.1s)]
*  They all kind of said it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  They were like, yeah, you know, with these stories about Russia, it's so hard to figure [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  out what's true and what's not because they always come from anonymous sources. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=250.98s)]
*  It's always people with an axe to grind. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=256.42s)]
*  There's always some agenda to it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=259.38s)]
*  And so you can't really know what's true or false. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=262.34s)]
*  And I remember thinking like, that understanding of how to view these stories, these reporting, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  is so much more well-informed, so much more rational, so much more skeptical than the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=275.85999999999996s)]
*  people who are online every day being paid to follow media and politics and journalism [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=282.62s)]
*  as their profession. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=287.73999999999995s)]
*  The experts who are running around crazy believing every Russiagate thing that appears. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=289.82s)]
*  Including many things that ended up being wildly debunked. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  The point of which is that it just is true that sometimes people who are quote unquote [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=300.29999999999995s)]
*  experts in the sense that they have the credentials you expect people to have end up too consumed [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=305.34s)]
*  in a kind of subculture where the only views that they get exposed to are the views that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=314.78s)]
*  they're constantly hearing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  I did a debate in New York ten days ago maybe about misinformation, disinformation, internet [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=324.3s)]
*  censorship, all of that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=333.62s)]
*  And it was a debate between myself and two other people. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=336.14s)]
*  One is a woman who's on the faculty of George Washington University and does research into [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=339.02s)]
*  disinformation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=343.5s)]
*  So like a disinformation expert, though to her credit she doesn't like that term, but [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=344.5s)]
*  that's essentially what she was there to be. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=348.62s)]
*  And then a University of Virginia professor who's a professor of media studies who is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=350.9s)]
*  regarded as some great expert in studying media and disinformation or whatever. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  And it was about a two hour debate and I was obviously more adversarial to both of them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  Though I liked her much, I was more impressed with the nuances of her view, but he with [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=367.34s)]
*  all these credentials, you know, PhD in this and whatever and on the faculty of a very [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=372.7s)]
*  good university, the University of Virginia. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=376.78s)]
*  Every view that he had was like this extremely banal, cliched, predictable, inch deep, liberal, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=380.62s)]
*  MSNBC view of politics, kind of prettified with the language of scholarship. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=387.38s)]
*  But everything he was saying was just so reflexive and the idea that there's even another way [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=395.98s)]
*  to look at things besides how he looks at it was offensive to him. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=400.86s)]
*  Like he could not conceive of that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=405.82s)]
*  He really believed that his political worldview was so correct that it ought to be deemed [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=408.64s)]
*  the truth and anything that deviates from it is by definition disinformation. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=413.7s)]
*  Even in topics that he's not an expert in like COVID where he was saying, you know, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=418.94s)]
*  anyone who disputes Dr. Fauci, people like Jay Bhattachara don't really have expertise [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=423.56s)]
*  in science. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=429.8s)]
*  They're just crackpots no matter what their credentials are. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=430.8s)]
*  And so there are a lot of people who are so-called experts who just get so immersed in a certain [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=433.44s)]
*  subculture where they just get validated all the time in their political views that they [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=436.68s)]
*  become far more blind as a result of their expertise than they are open-minded. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=440.70000000000005s)]
*  And so I think one of the most important things that independent media does is it allows people [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=447.70000000000005s)]
*  to build their own credibility. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=451.42s)]
*  And I absolutely think you can become an expert in a particular field without necessarily [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  having degrees from top universities. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=461.12s)]
*  Now I'm not somebody who disbelieves in expertise. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=463.26s)]
*  If I want to understand how a plane works, I'm likely to seek out a pilot or an aeronautical [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=467.7s)]
*  engineer than just some random person on the internet. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  If I have an issue with some organ of mine like my heart or something my kids do, I'm [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=478.26s)]
*  going to go to a cardiologist. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=482.78s)]
*  I'm not going to just do a Google search for somebody who claims to understand the heart. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=483.78s)]
*  It's not that I disbelieve in expertise, but especially when it comes to political debate, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=490.06s)]
*  I think confining yourself to that is extremely stultifying. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=495.7s)]
*  And that has been what independent media ultimately has been fueled by is this idea that, no, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=499.26s)]
*  we can listen to a lot of people and ultimately decide who's the most informed, who really [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=504.78s)]
*  is thinking most independently, most critically, most skeptically. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=508.98s)]
*  And sometimes it's people who don't necessarily have credentials. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=514.4399999999999s)]
*  And that has been what independent media has been about, is finding new voices, different [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=518.62s)]
*  voices, people with different perspectives than what the expert class is offering. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=523.22s)]
*  And the king of independent media for years has been Joe Rogan. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=530.3s)]
*  Joe Rogan has built many of these people's careers, many of their careers, by going on [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=535.94s)]
*  multiple times, by having him endorse their work. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=542.36s)]
*  I was on Rogan's show once, but he very, very often talked about my work and recommends [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=549.16s)]
*  it, but not somebody whose career platform has in any way been built or depended on Joe [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=553.36s)]
*  Rogan, but a lot of these people have. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=559.12s)]
*  And so typically you hear almost no criticism of Joe Rogan in the realm of independent media [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=561.12s)]
*  because of the power that he possesses because of his gigantic audience. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=566.08s)]
*  Suddenly, lo and behold, over the past couple months you're now hearing not just criticism [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=571.12s)]
*  of Joe Rogan, but very assertive, vocal, accusatory critiques of him from many of these people [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=577.42s)]
*  who have thrived in independent media and often been on Rogan's show many times. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=584.88s)]
*  And the only thing that has really changed about Rogan's show is that over the past year [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=592.44s)]
*  or so he has been putting on more and more people who are vocal critics of Israel. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=596.92s)]
*  And there's a, when Douglas Murray went on to Joe Rogan's show with Dave Smith, he clearly [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=604.16s)]
*  went on with the intention not to debate Dave Smith, but to scold Joe Rogan for having too [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=610.04s)]
*  many Israel critics on and not enough Israel supporters. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=615.5799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=619.0799999999999s)]
*  I remember so well. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=621.28s)]
*  From the time of October 7th onward that most of the people Joe Rogan had on to talk about [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=624.96s)]
*  Israel were vehemently pro-Israel. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=629.24s)]
*  He had the bench bureau on, he had Coleman Hughes on several times to talk about Israel, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=630.24s)]
*  he was a fanatical supporter of Israel, worked for the free press. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=636.24s)]
*  I mean, just one after the next. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  I even was going to make a list, but it was too long. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  Somebody recently put together a video, I just saw it today, where Douglas Murray says [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=643.6s)]
*  you don't have any people on who have the other view on Israel and he just did this [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  huge montage of the huge numbers of people who are fanatically pro-Israel that have been [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=650.64s)]
*  on Joe Rogan's show. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=654.84s)]
*  But that's the norm in the view of Israel supporters like Sam Harris and Douglas Murray [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  and Constantine Kissin. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=664.8s)]
*  Yeah, of course, you put Israel supporters on because those are the people who have the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=665.8s)]
*  right view and who are all throughout the media. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=671.08s)]
*  It's basically almost a requirement to be a supporter of Israel to get into media. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=675.8s)]
*  But the problem is that Joe Rogan has been putting on a lot of people who are not just [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=681.8s)]
*  opponents of Israel, but pretty aggressive ones. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=685.52s)]
*  He's had on Ian Carroll and Darrell Cooper, who writes under Martyr Made, Dave Smith several [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=687.5999999999999s)]
*  times and that is really starting to worry a lot of very pro-Israel people that it's [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=693.16s)]
*  a lot of people. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=702.88s)]
*  It's not just once in a while now that Joe Rogan is putting on pro-Israel critics of [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=703.88s)]
*  Israel, opponents of Israel, but doing so with more and more frequency, despite how [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  often he also still has on heavy supporter of Israel, but that is not permitted. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=711.6s)]
*  Israel supporters look for any source of Israel criticism and they target that. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=717.84s)]
*  That's why college campuses are being targeted. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=722.32s)]
*  That's why TikTok got targeted. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=725.52s)]
*  We talked before about how the original claim about TikTok was it was dangerous because [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=729.18s)]
*  of China, but that wasn't enough to get votes. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=732.4s)]
*  Only once people became convinced that there was too much Israel criticism on TikTok did [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=734.9799999999999s)]
*  that get banned and now they're after Joe Rogan's show and they're using this idea of [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=739.66s)]
*  expertise. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=743.78s)]
*  Like, hey, you're putting on these people like Dave Smith and Ian Carroll and Darrell [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=744.78s)]
*  Cooper and other Israel critics who aren't experts. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=753.66s)]
*  They don't know anything. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=757.42s)]
*  You should only have experts on. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=758.82s)]
*  Somehow Douglas Murray considers himself an expert even though the only degree he has [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=761.9000000000001s)]
*  is an undergraduate degree in English. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=766.46s)]
*  So if you were like judging expertise through normal credentials, you might invite Douglas [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=770.34s)]
*  Murray on to like analyze the Canterbury Tales and Chelser, but not much else, just like [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=774.0200000000001s)]
*  if you're going to do a show on English literature. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=780.62s)]
*  And then like he also got into a tank and the IDF took him around for about eight seconds [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=783.98s)]
*  to a few places in Gaza that they wanted to show him like, hey, look, here's a tunnel. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=789.88s)]
*  Here's this, here's that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=793.98s)]
*  And he thinks he's an expert because of that because he went on a propaganda trip. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=794.98s)]
*  And so now suddenly you see these people on independent media desperate to tell Rogan [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=798.74s)]
*  why they can't have Israel critics on and they're invoking the same kind of gatekeeping [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=802.46s)]
*  conception of expertise that corporate media for so long has embraced in order to exclude [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=808.34s)]
*  voices which they think ought to be excluded. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=814.14s)]
*  Everyone can see what's going on here. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=817.86s)]
*  Everyone understands what's motivating this. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=819.48s)]
*  And I think that a lot of Israel supporters are getting increasingly desperate as Israel [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=822.82s)]
*  critics find more and more of a platform, as there's more places that are giving voice [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=827.5s)]
*  to Israel criticism. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=831.14s)]
*  There's more parts of the political spectrum open to that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=832.26s)]
*  The whole show that support for Israel is declining. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=835.38s)]
*  It's kind of like lashing out like, oh my God, you can't put him on. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=839.58s)]
*  He's not an expert. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=841.9s)]
*  You can't put him on. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=842.9s)]
*  He's not an expert. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=843.9s)]
*  When, of course, it's not about expertise because how is Sam Harris or Douglas Murray [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=844.9s)]
*  or Constantine Kissin an expert in Israel anymore than Save Dave Smith is? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=853.9399999999999s)]
*  They're not. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=858.46s)]
*  They just are deemed to have the right level of knowledge because they're supporters of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=860.9s)]
*  Israel and that's essentially if you're an expert in the Middle East, by definition, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=866.02s)]
*  according to them, you're going to be an Israel supporter. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=869.18s)]
*  So I do think it's very revealing but also very expected. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=872.02s)]
*  Whenever some new venue or new faction is the outsider force, it's easy to wave these [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=878.86s)]
*  rebel flags like, yeah, we're the dissidents, we're the disruptors. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=888.34s)]
*  But then the minute they start to become the gatekeepers of opinion and information, they [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=891.86s)]
*  start replicating the tactics of the establishment they set out to subvert because they're now [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=899.54s)]
*  engaged in ruling class or establishment behavior. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=907.1s)]
*  And it's very interesting to watch Rogan become the target of that by people who he's valued [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=910.62s)]
*  and has helped build a career for and we'll see whether or not he's influenced by it to [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=916.26s)]
*  the extent to which he is. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=920.06s)]
*  It's a very powerful critique they're bringing and it's not people who Rogan doesn't like [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=921.74s)]
*  or hate but who he knows and respects and they're all unified now trying to pressure [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=926.42s)]
*  him to either stop putting on so many Israel critics or making sure that they always have [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=930.42s)]
*  an Israel supporter right by their side when he does and we'll see how that works. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k8mt9pVpds&t=935.26s)]
