# Lee Harvey Oswald More than a Lone Nut? JFK Reporter Jeff Morley on Shocking CIA Revelations
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg)
*  Jefferson Morley is a best-selling author and a veteran Washington journalist known [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=0.0s)]
*  for his investigative books that expose the covert history of American power. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=10.68s)]
*  His most recent book is Scorpion's Dance, the President, the Spy Master and Watergate, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=15.8s)]
*  which explores the secret relationship between CIA Director Richard Helms and President Richard [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=20.32s)]
*  Nixon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=24.8s)]
*  He is as well a leading authority. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=25.8s)]
*  I believe one of the top two or three journalistic authorities on the JFK assassination. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=27.88s)]
*  He has spent decades prying loose the CIA's deepest secrets and challenging the official [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=32.56s)]
*  narrative and he testified earlier today at Congress about what these newly declassified [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=36.4s)]
*  documents from the Trump administration adds to our understanding, not just of the assassination, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=41.08s)]
*  but the clear cover-up that took place as part of the investigation as well as the potential [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  CIA role in all of this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Some of that quite demonstrated, not just potential. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=52.56s)]
*  We're delighted he took the time to join us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=54.68s)]
*  Jeff, it's great to see you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=56.64s)]
*  Thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=57.64s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Glenn. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=60.96s)]
*  I'm very glad to be here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=61.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad to have you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=62.96s)]
*  I recommended the interview that you recently did on Breaking Points, which was about 30 [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  minutes that you did with Sagar and Jeddian and Ryan Grim. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=69.48s)]
*  I found it one of the most illuminating interviews in recent times, especially on these documents, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=72.36s)]
*  but I want to explore some other things beyond what's in that interview as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=77.36s)]
*  You testified earlier today before the House Task Force on Declassification, which is chaired [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=82.12s)]
*  by Congresswoman Annapolina Luna, the Republican of Florida. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=87.8s)]
*  I know that you and everybody else interested in not just the JFK assassination, but the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=93.56s)]
*  role that the CIA has played in our politics and our history was very interested in these [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=98.44s)]
*  documents and more broadly interested in getting to the bottom of this case, whether we really [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=102.94s)]
*  ever learned the truth. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  What was your sense having testified before the committee about whether that interest [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=108.78s)]
*  and excitement is shared by most members of Congress? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=112.62s)]
*  Well, let me talk about Chairwoman Luna first, because I've gotten to know her over the last [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=117.78s)]
*  couple of weeks when she launched this House Task Force on Declassification, and I've been [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=124.42s)]
*  very impressed with her attitude. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=129.78s)]
*  She's a can-do person. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=132.12s)]
*  I said, we need to get these documents from the CIA. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=133.82000000000002s)]
*  She said, give me a memo and I'll call Ratcliffe's office today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  She's very proactive. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  I think her leadership has been very strong. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=144.8s)]
*  We had some partisan politics in the hearing today, which I think was unfortunate because [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=147.28s)]
*  it's not really a partisan issue. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm a pretty liberal guy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  That's why I wanted to be on your show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=156.18s)]
*  I'm hopeful that the task force is going to do serious work. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=160.4s)]
*  The most encouraging sign, she says we're going to have another hearing on JFK and we're [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=163.52s)]
*  hoping to get some more first-hand witnesses to explicate the new history of JFK's assassination. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=167.78s)]
*  So I want to spend most of my time with you on the substance of these documents and the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=175.02s)]
*  investigation, but just before I get to that, which will be next, just along the same lines, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=178.3s)]
*  I don't want to make it a partisan issue either, but there is a palpable shift in how our political [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=181.74s)]
*  spectrum thinks about the US security state, the CIA, the nefarious role they've often [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=189.24s)]
*  played. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=195.52s)]
*  It used to be, as you said, you're a liberal Democrat. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=196.52s)]
*  It used to be foundational to American liberal and left-wing politics to distrust and view [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=199.36s)]
*  the CIA and the security state as quite sinister, as needing reform, and it was more typical [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=207.56s)]
*  that conservatives would defend them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=212.74s)]
*  No, these are patriotic organizations. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  We need them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=215.72s)]
*  We love them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=216.72s)]
*  They have to operate in the dark. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=217.72s)]
*  There's been so much change. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=219.2s)]
*  I mean, it was Donald Trump who finally declassified these documents as he promised to do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=220.2s)]
*  It's Chairwoman Luna, a very right-wing member of Congress who's leading the way, as you [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=223.68s)]
*  say, very proactively. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=227.8s)]
*  And I just want to show you a clip from today that involves Congresswoman Jasmine Kroc of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=228.8s)]
*  the Democratic Texas, who has become, in a lot of ways, one of the leading faces of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=236.0s)]
*  Democratic Party, the American liberalism, and here's what she had to say about the JFK [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=240.0s)]
*  and the hearing itself and the possibility of the CIA involvement. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=246.04s)]
*  Previously classified JFK assassination files are now public and show no evidence of a CIA [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=250.04s)]
*  conspiracy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=260.48s)]
*  But what I find funny about this hearing is that the Republicans are here re-litigating [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=261.48s)]
*  whether CIA agents lied 60 years ago, but aren't doing anything about the CIA director [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=266.76s)]
*  lying to Congress just six days ago. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=274.44s)]
*  We should be having a hearing on the fact that the unqualified Secretary of Defense [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  and other senior Trump officials were carelessly discussing classified military plans over [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=281.44s)]
*  an unsecured signal group chat. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=287.24s)]
*  And instead of providing oversight over the administration's handling of classified information, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  the Republicans have... [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so there's more of that, but she's essentially saying, look, these new documents vindicated [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  the CIA that had no role to play in any of this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=303.12s)]
*  Anyone who suggests otherwise is a conspiracy theory. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=305.4s)]
*  And in any event, it doesn't really even matter. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=307.28s)]
*  There's no reason for us to know we should focus on a signal gate or whatever. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  As somebody who's been aligned with the Democratic Party for a long time, do you think that's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=313.08s)]
*  become a more common sentiment? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=317.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=320.44s)]
*  And it's really unfortunate, I mean, to bring up something totally unrelated about what's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=322.52s)]
*  going on with the current controversy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=326.68s)]
*  The JFK files is something that there is broad support for across the political spectrum, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=330.48s)]
*  and there's no need to drag partisan politics into this issue. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=336.4s)]
*  It's just not an issue. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=339.92s)]
*  Representative Luna did a good job of leading this, and this kind of reflects it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=342.36s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett hadn't even read the documents. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=347.88s)]
*  She didn't even listen to what I said about the false testimony of three top CIA officials. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=350.04s)]
*  Facts don't register anymore, which is a problem in the university. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's especially a problem when we're actually making progress on the JFK story. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=362.76s)]
*  President Trump's order was a breakthrough, and it's one of the few things I agree with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=368.88s)]
*  him about. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=373.52s)]
*  A very positive measure we obtained last, on March 18th, a lot of important information, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=374.52s)]
*  and we're getting more as we proceed. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=380.32s)]
*  Remember, Glenn, they released 80,000 pages of documents on March 18th. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=382.68s)]
*  I might have seen 1,000 pages of those. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=388.16s)]
*  I've talked to researchers who've seen a few thousand more, but we're just at the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=390.48s)]
*  beginning of this process of really getting our hands and our minds around these new records. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=394.64s)]
*  And so that's the positive thing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  Luna's talking about having another hearing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  I think that's a good idea to bring more JFK witnesses and educate people about what really happened. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=404.04s)]
*  I thought it was bizarre when the day that it was released, everybody ran to their social [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=410.4s)]
*  media accounts or their programs to tell everybody what these documents show. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=416.08s)]
*  We focused only on one document, which was the unredacted Sussinger memo, and only to [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=419.4s)]
*  the extent that it revealed things about the CIA in general, not necessarily their role [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=423.84s)]
*  in, if any, in the JFK assassination. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=427.52s)]
*  And I want to get to that memo in a second, because I do think it's of profound importance. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=431.76s)]
*  But before I do, I think some of this is generational. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  I didn't live through the JFK assassination. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=439.64s)]
*  I wasn't born yet. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=441.32s)]
*  Other people who were were not very old. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=443.84s)]
*  Obviously Congresswoman Crockett wasn't. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=446.4s)]
*  She was born, I think, in the 1980s or even 1990s. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=448.28s)]
*  So I understand why some people might say, oh, this is kind of old and ancient history [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=451.2s)]
*  that we don't need to go excavating through. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=456.2s)]
*  What is your answer to that? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=459.88s)]
*  Why do you think it matters so much to kind of continue with the investigation? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=460.88s)]
*  Well, let me explain. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=466.35999999999996s)]
*  My readership at the JFK Facts newsletter is very diverse, from MAGA Christian nationalists [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=470.11999999999995s)]
*  on the right, libertarians, anti-imperialists, liberals on the left. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  And we don't have a big culture war on the site. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=483.2s)]
*  People want to talk about this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=489.47999999999996s)]
*  People want a real debate. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  The idea that people are coming reflexively to the defense of the CIA without even acknowledging [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=493.64s)]
*  or incorporating these records, we're going to talk about the Schlesinger memo in a second. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=502.52s)]
*  Why should people care? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  What we're missing right now in American politics is what President Kennedy talked about in [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=510.4s)]
*  1963. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=515.36s)]
*  He's talked about we need a strategy for peace. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=517.64s)]
*  We need a peace in our time, peace for all times, not a Pax Americana enforced with America [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=520.96s)]
*  as the world's policeman, but a peace for everybody. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=528.0s)]
*  And that's the vision really that died in Dallas. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=531.36s)]
*  So when people say, why does it matter now? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=534.0s)]
*  You don't hear that voice anymore in American politics, not from Democrats and not from [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=537.36s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=542.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's what's missing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=544.08s)]
*  And that's why it's important to understand what died when President Kennedy died. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=545.48s)]
*  We've lost something very real. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=549.48s)]
*  And I would say, you know, the most aggressive factions in the American security establishment [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=550.88s)]
*  after President Kennedy's assassination, because there was no real accountability, there was [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  no real investigation, that faction has had impunity ever since. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=562.0s)]
*  And that's led to a much more militarized, aggressive interventionist foreign policy, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=566.52s)]
*  which Kennedy was trying to steer the country away from. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=572.0s)]
*  That's what's important about the Kennedy assassination. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=575.8s)]
*  We lost something when we lost President Kennedy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=577.84s)]
*  So let me dive into these details now. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=580.88s)]
*  And let's start with the Schlesinger memo. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=583.4s)]
*  For our viewers who might have seen it, I think when it was released, I believe two [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=586.4s)]
*  weeks ago, we delved very deeply into what this memo is, what the newly released material [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=589.84s)]
*  demonstrates. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=595.08s)]
*  And in sum, for those who don't know, Arthur Schlesinger was a very respected historian, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=596.08s)]
*  especially among the kind of Kennedy circle. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=602.6s)]
*  And after the Bay of Pigs debacle and the firing of Alan Dulles, who was sort of the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=605.92s)]
*  father of the CIA, JFK was very interested in getting a hold of the CIA, asked Arthur [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=609.6s)]
*  Schlesinger to write this memo. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=615.52s)]
*  And he wrote this long memo detailing all of the abuses and dangers of having this kind [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=617.16s)]
*  of runaway, unaccountable secret agency off on its own, making foreign policy, engineering [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=622.0s)]
*  coups away from the State Department, and also offered a lot of plans for how to rein [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=626.6s)]
*  it in. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=631.02s)]
*  Pretty serious and severe plans. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=632.02s)]
*  So I want to hear what your thoughts are on the newly released portion of that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=635.4200000000001s)]
*  So before you get to that, was there, do we have evidence that the CIA was aware of the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=638.52s)]
*  conversations taking place in the JFK White House about the need to rein in the CIA? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=645.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=650.12s)]
*  Dick Helms, Richard Helms, the director of the CIA said in his memoir that this period [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  after the Bay of Pigs was a stormy... [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=657.68s)]
*  Sorry, he was the director of the CIA when? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=659.96s)]
*  Dick Helms, not in the 60s, but later on with Nixon? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=661.64s)]
*  No, he was deputy director. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=665.12s)]
*  At the time of the Bay of Pigs and later became director. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=668.64s)]
*  So at the time of Kennedy's assassination, he was deputy director. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  And Helms said in his memoir, this was a stormy interregnum for the agency, where they understood [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=675.16s)]
*  that their continued existence was in the balance. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, Kennedy decided not to do the reorganization. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  It was just too big a lift, I think, for him in terms of politics. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=688.1999999999999s)]
*  But the Schlesinger memo shows that he was talking about it very seriously. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=693.04s)]
*  And the key thing there was what Schlesinger called the encroachment of the CIA on the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=697.0s)]
*  president's foreign policymaking authority. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=704.16s)]
*  And you've talked about the Schlesinger memo. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=706.92s)]
*  You recall some of those details. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=709.04s)]
*  47% of State Department officers at the time of Kennedy's assassination were in fact CIA [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=711.0799999999999s)]
*  officers. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=717.64s)]
*  So the CIA is taking over the political reporting function of the State Department. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=718.64s)]
*  And of course, that limited the president's ability to make foreign policy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=722.76s)]
*  That's what Kennedy was concerned about. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=728.16s)]
*  And that's what Schlesinger was trying to, that's the problem Schlesinger was trying [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=729.68s)]
*  to solve. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=733.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=734.56s)]
*  I mean, in that memo, he, I think quite famously and quite pointedly and importantly, called [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=735.56s)]
*  it a state within a state, which is kind of ironic since now the term deep state has become [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=739.88s)]
*  this source of liberal mockery, as though it's some bizarre unhinged conspiracy theory. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=745.04s)]
*  And you knew you had Dwight Eisenhower coming out of the 50s, serving two year, two terms [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=749.36s)]
*  as president, warning about the military industrial complex on his way out. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=753.28s)]
*  And then you have Arthur Schlesinger calling it a state within a state when writing to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=756.96s)]
*  JFK about it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=762.72s)]
*  So this memo has been out for a while. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=763.72s)]
*  I think for a few years or even longer. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=766.88s)]
*  But what we have now, thanks to President Trump's declassification order, is the full [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=769.52s)]
*  unredacted memo. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=774.72s)]
*  So is there, are there things that we have learned that are important in the unredacted [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=776.4s)]
*  parts that we didn't previously know? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=781.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=783.2s)]
*  I mean, there was a whole page that was redacted. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=784.2s)]
*  So like the statistic that I just quoted to you, the 47% of State Department officers [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=788.88s)]
*  were actually CIA officers. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=794.46s)]
*  That was redacted by the CIA for the past 60 years. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=796.62s)]
*  The fact that the CIA had 128 people in the Paris embassy, that was redacted. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=802.16s)]
*  And you know, when you look at it, that's not national security information. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  No American would be threatened or harmed by that information. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=812.52s)]
*  It's only the reputation of the CIA. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=815.8s)]
*  And so what you see in these redactions, these redactions are justified in the name of national [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=817.64s)]
*  security, right? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=822.36s)]
*  You need to protect us from our enemies. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=823.36s)]
*  Our enemies aren't fooled. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=825.36s)]
*  The only people that were fooled were the American people. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=826.48s)]
*  And that's why we need this full declassification because we're the only ones that are in the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=829.52s)]
*  dark about the way the CIA is operating. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  About your argument that the reason the CIA or other parts of the government perceived [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=839.24s)]
*  JFK to be threatening, perhaps threatening enough to want to kill him, is that he was [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=844.16s)]
*  talking about this radical transformation of our foreign policy, of finding a way to [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=849.8s)]
*  get out of endless wars and become a nation of peace. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=855.0799999999999s)]
*  There are people very knowledgeable who are also on the left. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=859.24s)]
*  One of them is Noam Chomsky, who has said over the years that he finds that unpersuasive [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=862.72s)]
*  because, and I guess is a very chomsky way of looking at things, that although there [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=868.12s)]
*  was a little bit of resistance here and there on the part of JFK and his administration [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=872.24s)]
*  to the military industrial complex, the intelligence community, obviously they had a argument after [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=876.58s)]
*  the Bay of Pigs. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=880.64s)]
*  They fired, as I said earlier, Alan Dulles. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=881.64s)]
*  But essentially, JFK was a militarist. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=886.64s)]
*  It was a good Cold Warrior. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=889.08s)]
*  He was the one who oversaw what Chomsky calls the invasion of South Vietnam by the United [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=891.42s)]
*  States. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=896.14s)]
*  And that really, if you were a militarist or a Cold Warrior, you'd have no reason to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=897.14s)]
*  look at JFK and find him bothersome. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=901.08s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=903.5s)]
*  None of Kennedy's enemies on the right ever said that at the time. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=907.28s)]
*  They said that he was a weakling, if not a traitor. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=912.1s)]
*  The idea that Kennedy was a Cuba hawk or a Vietnam hawk, no Cuba hawk or Vietnam hawk [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=916.2s)]
*  in 1963 ever said that. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=922.1s)]
*  The problem with Chomsky's argument is he hasn't really familiarized himself with the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=926.6800000000001s)]
*  debates. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=930.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, CIA Director Richard Helms was trying to pressure Kennedy into a more aggressive [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=931.9200000000001s)]
*  Cuba policy. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=937.72s)]
*  And four days before the assassination, Richard Helms brought a machine gun into the Oval [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=939.4000000000001s)]
*  Office as a way of convincing President Kennedy to take a more aggressive stance. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=945.04s)]
*  And when you read Kennedy's account of it, it's hard not to believe that he understood [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=949.7199999999999s)]
*  that he was being threatened. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=955.36s)]
*  I mean, think about that. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=957.16s)]
*  The CIA Director, Deputy CIA Director is demonstrating to the President, your security perimeter [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  is not secure. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=966.0799999999999s)]
*  That's four days before President Kennedy was killed. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=968.4399999999999s)]
*  So the idea that there weren't profound conflicts at the top of the U.S. government, I mean, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=971.32s)]
*  I know Noam Chomsky is a smart guy, but he needs to pay attention to the historical record. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=977.6s)]
*  There were profound conflicts between Kennedy and the National Security Establishment in [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=982.5200000000001s)]
*  the fall of 1963. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=987.6s)]
*  Nobody who pays attention, especially to the new records, that that wasn't the case. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=989.44s)]
*  Yeah, and obviously Chomsky's not here to defend himself, but he's obviously talked [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=994.0400000000001s)]
*  many times about this so people interested can go to YouTube and find out. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=998.6s)]
*  I think he has a propensity against what he calls conspiracy theories and just kind of [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1002.2s)]
*  dismissing them out of hand and, you know, nobody's perfect. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1005.48s)]
*  Yeah, but let me ask you this. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1008.48s)]
*  This is one of the things I learned from your work. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1011.1600000000001s)]
*  I remember growing up in the 70s and 80s and my understanding of the JFK assassination [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1012.5200000000001s)]
*  was that Lee Harvey Oswald was just sort of this like weird loner that he had like a couple [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1019.5200000000001s)]
*  of appearances here and there in some, you know, public and political sectors, but that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1026.24s)]
*  by and large he was kind of a nobody, sort of like what they're depicting the person [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1033.76s)]
*  who did the first assassination attempt against President Trump in Pennsylvania, like just [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1037.52s)]
*  a guy, a weirdo, not really connected. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1042.0400000000002s)]
*  And it was only really through following your work and the work of a couple other people [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1044.68s)]
*  that I actually learned things like, no, the CIA had a lot of interest in Oswald prior [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1048.0s)]
*  to the JFK. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1053.44s)]
*  I thought nobody knew of him before this all happened. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
*  In fact, the CIA had a big, long, large surveillance file on him. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1057.72s)]
*  What is it that the CIA, what interest did the CIA have in Oswald prior to Oswald's [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1063.28s)]
*  alleged role in the JFK assassination? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  They were interested, first of all, in recruiting him as a possible source or contact behind [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1074.6s)]
*  the Iron Curtain. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1082.1599999999999s)]
*  And that was one of the key documents that emerged on March 18th was a document where [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1083.48s)]
*  Angleton talked exactly about who he targeted for that type of recruiting. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1089.0s)]
*  The second thing that they were interested in was his pro-Cuba activities. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1094.96s)]
*  And that was something that the CIA denied at the time. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1099.8s)]
*  They pretended like they didn't know anything about this. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1106.44s)]
*  You know, when you talk about a big surveillance file, you know, this is what I showed to Representative [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1108.6s)]
*  Luna today. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1112.56s)]
*  They had 198 pages on him on November 15th when President Kennedy was getting ready to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1113.9199999999998s)]
*  go to Dallas. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1120.32s)]
*  So Lee Harvey Oswald was not a lone nut in the eyes of the CIA. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1121.56s)]
*  He was a known quantity who top CIA officials, top counterintelligence officials knew everything [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1126.24s)]
*  about him as President Kennedy was preparing to go to Dallas. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1132.0s)]
*  So of course there's suspicions, you know, and people say, oh, well, that's incompetence [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1135.28s)]
*  or, you know, they didn't know Oswald didn't present a threat. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1139.2s)]
*  Give me a second. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1142.4s)]
*  Part of the reason you have a counterintelligence staff is to protect you against assassinations. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1143.4s)]
*  And that clearly didn't happen. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1150.3200000000002s)]
*  Angleton failed to do his job. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1152.72s)]
*  But nobody knew anything about this. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1154.3400000000001s)]
*  The CIA imposed a cover story, the lone gunman, and Angleton, instead of losing his job, he [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1156.0s)]
*  kept it for another decade. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1162.2s)]
*  Well, let me ask, I know you have to go in just a few minutes, so I want to just respect [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1164.2s)]
*  the time. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1168.0800000000002s)]
*  I just have a couple more questions briefly. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1169.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, this is one of the things that, like, you know, I think that you grow up and [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1172.08s)]
*  you're kind of bombarded to believe the established narrative about everything. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1176.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's why it's the established narrative, because they have control of the institutions [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1179.4399999999998s)]
*  that shape your thinking. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1182.1599999999999s)]
*  And the more you kind of look into these things, the more basis you have for skepticism, including [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1183.6399999999999s)]
*  the fact that, you know, Alan Dulles, who, you know, led the CIA, gave birth to the CIA, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1189.1999999999998s)]
*  directed the CIA, was controlling almost everything in there until Kennedy fired him, and then [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1196.52s)]
*  Kennedy fired him, was put onto the Warren Commission, where naturally, as being Alan [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1200.2s)]
*  Dulles, he, you know, had immense weight on conducting the official investigation. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1205.52s)]
*  I've always said it's kind of like putting Ben Shapiro in charge of an investigation [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  to find out who's at fault in Gaza. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1214.64s)]
*  You know, you know what kind of outcome you're going to get if you put Alan Dulles on the [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1216.8s)]
*  Warren Commission. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1220.52s)]
*  You're putting, like, a chief suspect on there. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1221.52s)]
*  What are the best reasons we have to distrust both the process and the conclusions of the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1227.1599999999999s)]
*  Warren Commission? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1233.08s)]
*  I mean, the fact that Alan Dulles was on it, the fact that the Warren Commission was deceived [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1235.8799999999999s)]
*  about the surveillance of Oswald, they had no idea that the CIA had 198 pages of material [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1240.32s)]
*  on Oswald. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1247.52s)]
*  The Warren Commission was told that they had only minimal information about Oswald. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1248.52s)]
*  So, you know, the Warren Commission was fed a false story about Oswald. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1253.72s)]
*  Glenn, I'm going to have to go soon. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1258.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay, I know. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1260.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1261.32s)]
*  I have one more question, but I'm going to let you go. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1262.32s)]
*  One more question, yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1263.68s)]
*  Okay, I'll just ask it briefly. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1264.68s)]
*  James Engleton, who was this senior CIA official, has been central to your work. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1267.84s)]
*  You said today in your testimony that he was one of three senior CIA officials to have [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1271.92s)]
*  lied to the Warren Commission about the investigation, that that was sort of a tipping point for [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1276.2s)]
*  you. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1280.92s)]
*  What did Engleton lie about and how did he deceive the commission? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1282.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, actually, what we learned last month was that Engleton lied to the House Select [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1287.64s)]
*  Committee on Assassinations in 1978. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1293.0800000000002s)]
*  He was never had to testify to the Warren Commission. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1296.0s)]
*  In 1978, he testified and he was asked, was Oswald ever the subject of a CIA project? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1299.8000000000002s)]
*  The answer was yes. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1306.6s)]
*  Engleton had personally put Oswald under mail surveillance. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1308.08s)]
*  They were intercepting his letters to his mother from the Soviet Union. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1312.0s)]
*  He was under mail surveillance from 1959 to 1962. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1315.96s)]
*  When Engleton was asked by the HSCA, was Oswald ever part of a CIA project? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  He said no. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1327.1599999999999s)]
*  What we know now is that that was a lie. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1328.6799999999998s)]
*  He was lying under oath about what he knew about Oswald before the assassination. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1333.04s)]
*  That was a tipping point for me because until March 18th, we never knew that. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1337.44s)]
*  All right, Jeff. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1341.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you for your great work. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  We're going to definitely have you back on as you work your way through these documents. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1343.8799999999999s)]
*  We'd love to pick your brain more about this. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1347.8s)]
*  Really appreciate the time. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1350.28s)]
*  I know you're busy tonight after your testimony, so we're going to let you go, but thanks once [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1351.28s)]
*  again. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1354.84s)]
*  Thanks a million for having me, Glenn. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1357.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1358.2s)]
*  Talk to you soon. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1359.2s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1360.2s)]
*  We all have unhealthy dietary vices. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1363.2s)]
*  Mine is the fact that I have kids in the house and they insist on having Doritos, a food [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1365.96s)]
*  that's very unhealthy and yet to which I often get addicted and I just have to eat it without [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1370.5s)]
*  end and once they have it in the house, which they insist on having, I ask them to hide [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1375.3999999999999s)]
*  it from me because if not, I'll just shove it all down my face in a very disgusting but [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1378.8s)]
*  addictive and compulsive manner. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1382.76s)]
*  We're all human and I try to eat very healthy. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1384.08s)]
*  It's a high priority for mine, but nobody can always eat healthy and that's why doctors [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1387.24s)]
*  have created Field of Greens, which is a delicious glass of Field of Greens daily. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgPoLwKu2sg&t=1391.6s)]
