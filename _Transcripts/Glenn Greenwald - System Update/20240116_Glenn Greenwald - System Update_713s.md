# Bernie Mocks the Leftâ€™s Vow Not to Vote for Biden Over Israel
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ)
*  Earlier today, Bernie Sanders was on CNN with Jake Tapper. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And there has been a lot of talk among American progressives and young liberal voters claiming [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=14.44s)]
*  that they are so angry at Joe Biden for his unstinting and unlimited support for Israel [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  and its destruction of Gaza that for them that is just a red line that will cause them [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=27.08s)]
*  to refrain from voting for Joe Biden no matter what, no matter who he's running against. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=33.4s)]
*  And they have said this over and over. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=38.68s)]
*  It's not just progressive voters and younger voters, but also Muslim and Arab voters who [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=40.96s)]
*  are particularly important in several swing states, most importantly Michigan, where if [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=45.68s)]
*  they really did refrain in large numbers from voting for Biden due to their anger over [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=50.84s)]
*  Biden's support for Israel and its war against Gaza, that could actually make the difference [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=54.92s)]
*  not just to Michigan, but in the election. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=60.04s)]
*  And so Bernie Sanders was asked whether or not that is a serious threat that progressives [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  would actually do that, would actually refrain from voting for Biden even if his opponent [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=67.52s)]
*  were Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=72.3s)]
*  And this is what Bernie Sanders said in response to Jake Tapper. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=73.3s)]
*  President Biden has caught a lot of criticism from the left on his support for Israel amid [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=76.6s)]
*  this war. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  You're a leader on the progressive left, the movement that you helped create in your presidential [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=82.36s)]
*  campaigns. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=87.52s)]
*  Do you think that young progressives in the United States will ultimately rally behind [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=88.72s)]
*  Joe Biden in November, or has he seriously damaged his standing? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=93.2s)]
*  Look, I think we will see what happens in November because the choice is pretty clear. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=97.84s)]
*  Running against Donald Trump, who I suspect will be the Republican candidate, is one of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=104.56s)]
*  the most dangerous political figures in modern American history. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=108.44s)]
*  So I think people will end up rallying around Biden. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=111.7s)]
*  But there is no question it is very hard for young people, I think for most Americans, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=114.7s)]
*  to be excited about what is going on right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  President has got to change course. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  He has been very clear. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  He has expressed his concern about quote unquote indiscriminate bombing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=126.38s)]
*  He has asked Netanyahu over and over again to change course. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu just yesterday said, no, we're going to continue doing what we are doing, unacceptable. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=134.78s)]
*  You cannot give billions of dollars to a country that ignores your wishes, violates [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=140.1s)]
*  international law. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=144.78s)]
*  So I would hope that the president follows through on his concerns and says to Netanyahu, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=146.78s)]
*  this is unacceptable. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=152.18s)]
*  You're not getting a nickel more from the United States unless you radically change [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=153.18s)]
*  course. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=157.06s)]
*  We're not going to see hundreds and hundreds of thousands of children starve to death. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=158.06s)]
*  Now this is such classic Bernie Sanders because for the first two or three months of the campaign, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=162.26s)]
*  of the war rather, Bernie Sanders was vehemently supportive of the Israeli war in Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=167.78s)]
*  And he adamantly refused when asked if he would support a ceasefire. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=173.7s)]
*  He continuously said, absolutely not. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=177.98s)]
*  A ceasefire will help Hamas. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=179.5s)]
*  And so when it mattered, Bernie Sanders stood up and defended Joe Biden's support for Israel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=182.7s)]
*  He defended what the Israelis were doing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=187.1s)]
*  And the fact that arguably the most influential voice in the progressive left was defending [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden's Israel policy and his support for an arming of Israel made a big difference [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=196.4s)]
*  in terms of the posture of the Democratic Party that said, like, even if Bernie Sanders [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=201.96s)]
*  is unwilling to criticize Biden for doing this, well, that gives us all the space in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=206.88s)]
*  the world that we need to also support Joe Biden. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=211.44s)]
*  Now as it increasingly doesn't matter because the Israelis have made very clear that they [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=214.68s)]
*  don't care what the Biden administration says at this point, they extracted and Biden willingly [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=220.72s)]
*  gave the commitment that the United States is going to fund an armed Israel no matter [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=225.84s)]
*  what it does. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  There are no red lines the Israelis can cross that could jeopardize the funding that the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  United States is providing them or the weapons that the United States is providing them to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=236.96s)]
*  fight this war. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  So obviously, if you're Israel and you hear from Joe Biden, as they've repeatedly heard, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=242.94s)]
*  look, we may criticize you, but don't worry. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=247.84s)]
*  We're going to give you all the money in the arms that you need. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=251.72s)]
*  Obviously, if you're the Israelis, you're going to ignore what Biden and his officials [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=254.8s)]
*  are saying because it doesn't matter if they criticize you since the support is inevitable [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=260.32s)]
*  and unconditional. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=264.48s)]
*  And that's what Bernie helped create. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  Now they have a political problem. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=268.24s)]
*  The political problem is that the younger voters, the more left-wing voters, the Muslim [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=270.56s)]
*  and Arab voters have become enraged by Biden's support for Israel and have repeatedly said [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  that they would not vote for Biden as a result of this anger. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=282.72s)]
*  And so they need to give away and as this war keeps going on and Biden is still a patron [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=286.6s)]
*  of this war, obviously that anger builds and builds. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=292.16s)]
*  So they need some way to try and tell these leftists who are threatening not to vote for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=294.72s)]
*  Biden, oh, look, there's still a place for you in the Democratic Party. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  So now you have Bernie Sanders coming out when it really doesn't matter saying Israel's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  war is illegal and immoral and the United States should no longer support it knowing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=309.28s)]
*  full well that it's not going to have any impact on what Joe Biden does. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=313.4s)]
*  But he's creating this illusion for the left that look, there's still a space for you in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm even though I'm independent, technically, I support the Democratic Party. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  I support Joe Biden and I'm as angry as you are about what Israel is doing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=326.11999999999995s)]
*  So we're still allies. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=331.28s)]
*  You and I, we think just exactly alike. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=332.44s)]
*  And the reason Bernie's doing that is so that he can maintain this channel to continue to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=334.8s)]
*  speak with those people with credibility to say, look, I know we're angry at what Biden [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=339.36s)]
*  is doing in Israel. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  I agree with you that it's wrong. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we still have to vote for Biden. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  That's Bernie's role. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=352.16s)]
*  That's the role of AOC and Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=353.2s)]
*  They create the illusion that if you're disaffected, if you're angry about Joe Biden, if you're [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=356.36s)]
*  angry at the Democratic Party, if you dislike the Democratic Party, there's still space [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=361.16s)]
*  for you in the Democratic Party because there are people who think like you do, Bernie and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=365.6s)]
*  AOC. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=368.6s)]
*  And they're going to tell you, they're going to validate your anger. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  They're going to validate your emotions. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=372.56s)]
*  They don't ever affect anything, but they are there to make you feel like even if you're [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=374.16s)]
*  an angry, rebellious liberal or leftist, you still find like-minded people in the Democratic [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=378.0s)]
*  Party. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=384.56s)]
*  And those are the people who are going to tell you that no matter how angry you are, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=385.56s)]
*  it is still your overarching moral duty to go and vote for Joe Biden because of how [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=390.08s)]
*  uniquely dangerous and threatening Donald Trump is. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=395.08s)]
*  So that is what Jake Tapper is asking Bernie to do. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=399.12s)]
*  He's not really asking what is your prediction. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  He's really saying, this is your time to speak to those people and tell them they still have [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=404.24s)]
*  to vote for Biden. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=407.88s)]
*  And Bernie performed his function as he always does, very loyally. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=409.68s)]
*  He said, I'm angry at Biden, another nickel for Israel. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=413.2s)]
*  But the real point of this message, the only thing that actually matters in what Bernie's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=418.22s)]
*  saying is even though I'm angry with you, we still have to vote for Joe Biden. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=421.64000000000004s)]
*  And what Bernie is saying is like, of course these people who are throwing a fit and pretending [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=427.54s)]
*  that they're not going to vote for Biden, we're going to scare them about Trump. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=433.26000000000005s)]
*  We're going to keep telling them Trump is Hitler. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=436.3s)]
*  Trump is coming to take away the rights of their trans friends and Trump is going to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=438.58000000000004s)]
*  create camps for dissidents. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  All the stuff that the New York Times was previewing, that Trump is going to be a dictator, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=445.98s)]
*  that Trump is going to be a fascist. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=450.98s)]
*  And Bernie's laughing at the idea that these progressives and leftists will maintain any [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  amount of independence and won't do what they're told at the end of the day because he's right [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=456.62s)]
*  to think that because in this country, there's a kind of hard left that always maintains [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=462.24s)]
*  its independence of the Democratic Party. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=468.14000000000004s)]
*  They won't vote Democrat. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=469.66s)]
*  They vote for Jill Stein or they vote for Ralph Nader. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=471.24s)]
*  They were preparing to vote for Cornel West if he were going to be on the ballot. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=475.18s)]
*  And they're always the people who follow their convictions and don't vote for Democrats, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=480.98s)]
*  but they're a very small number. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=485.1s)]
*  The people who don't vote Democrat who are leftists. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=486.66s)]
*  The people you need to keep in line in captivity are liberals and leftists. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=489.5s)]
*  And that's what Bernie's there to do. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=493.98s)]
*  And he's laughing at the idea that they won't vote for Democrats because they always vote [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=495.18s)]
*  for Democrats because it always works to scare them to say, oh look, the Republican is worse [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=498.62s)]
*  no matter how angry you are the Democrats. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=502.82s)]
*  And that's why Bernie says, of course they're going to snap into line at the end. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=504.26000000000005s)]
*  They always do these people. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=507.26000000000005s)]
*  We just play with them like marionettes. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=508.66s)]
*  They're our little puppets. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=511.18s)]
*  We let them be angry for a little while and then we're like, okay, get into the voting [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=512.58s)]
*  booth and do your job and vote for Biden and then go out. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=515.34s)]
*  Now the irony of this is that Bernie is recognizing the obvious truth that if Biden tells Netanyahu, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=518.78s)]
*  you're going to get our weapons, you're going to get our money no matter what you do, then [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=531.46s)]
*  Netanyahu is going to ignore Biden and all of his requests to be more civilian friendly [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=535.62s)]
*  and how he carries out this war because once you pledge unconditional support to somebody, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=540.5400000000001s)]
*  they no longer rationally care about your grievances. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=545.22s)]
*  Everyone who ever sat down at the negotiating table knows that what leverage is, is you [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=548.94s)]
*  have to have a credible threat to walk away. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=552.9000000000001s)]
*  If someone knows that you're desperate to do a deal and that you'll take whatever you [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=557.54s)]
*  can get, they're never going to give you anything more than what they want to give you because [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=561.54s)]
*  they know at the end of the day you're too scared to get up and leave. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=566.42s)]
*  You're going to stay there and you're going to sign what they tell you to sign no matter [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=569.06s)]
*  what, so they're going to only give you what you want. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=572.3s)]
*  You have no leverage. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=573.3s)]
*  You've lost your leverage because you've pledged that you're not going to walk away. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=574.3s)]
*  Conservatives are very good at this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=581.22s)]
*  The Republican Party fears conservative voters because conservative voters say, I only will [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=582.22s)]
*  vote for Republican Party leaders if we get what we want. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=585.46s)]
*  And actually the centrists in the Democratic Party are very good at this too. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=589.58s)]
*  They won't give their votes unless they get what they want. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=593.98s)]
*  The people who are the worst at this are liberals and leftists. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=596.26s)]
*  So they can recognize in the case of Israel that Joe Biden's pledge of unconditional support [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=599.98s)]
*  for Israel makes Joe Biden's grievances irrelevant, but somehow they can't recognize that their [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=606.26s)]
*  pledge of unconditional loyalty to and support for the Democratic Party makes their grievances [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=612.22s)]
*  irrelevant. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=617.1s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders is laughing at them and mocking them, knowing that these are the people [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=618.1s)]
*  who are the most easily manipulated, the most easily put in captivity, and who always run [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=621.74s)]
*  to vote for Democrats every two years because all you have to do is tell them that Republicans [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=627.74s)]
*  are scarier. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=631.98s)]
*  And that's what Bernie is saying is going to work in this case as well like it always [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=632.98s)]
*  has before. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=635.5s)]
*  We'll see if he's right. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=636.5s)]
*  I think the level of intensity and anger at Joe Biden for supporting the Israeli war [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=638.42s)]
*  in Gaza now going on to its fourth month is more intense and greater than I've seen among [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=643.74s)]
*  American leftists and liberals, the kind who vote for Democrats. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=651.26s)]
*  But I also share Bernie's skepticism that they're going to maintain that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=654.74s)]
*  I think this onslaught of propaganda that Trump is this dictator, that a fascist is [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=660.18s)]
*  a singular evil in American political life, no one's ever been like Trump, is going to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=664.78s)]
*  scare enough leftists and liberals, even the ones now pledging they won't vote for Joe [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=668.78s)]
*  Biden, that they will snap into line like they always do and go be good Democrats and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=672.14s)]
*  vote for Biden. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=675.62s)]
*  But that is what Bernie's role is, NAOC's role is, is to tell them we're like you, we [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=677.38s)]
*  share your anger, but at the end of the day, you're going to vote Democrat. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWy7ruhoAQ&t=682.1s)]
