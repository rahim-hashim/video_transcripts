# Dems' Sick Liz Cheney Obsession On Full Display
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA)
*  Joe Biden, I put that in quotes because things are done in his name that you really suspect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=0.0s)]
*  are not his decisions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=11.56s)]
*  He barely knows where he is. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=13.52s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the press conference where he read from a teleprompter. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=14.52s)]
*  He's on vacation in the Caribbean. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=18.36s)]
*  They made this crappy looking makeshift room and he kind of shuffled into it and stumbled [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=20.46s)]
*  all over himself when he was reading from the teleprompter about what happened in New [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=25.64s)]
*  Orleans and then kind of shuffled out, of course, took no questions. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=30.36s)]
*  We don't have a functional president in the United States. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=34.32s)]
*  We haven't for quite a long time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=36.32s)]
*  That's its own major scandal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=39.08s)]
*  But the White House earlier today listed or released its names, the list of the people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=41.72s)]
*  who Joe Biden attends to bestow the Presidential Citizen Medal on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=47.28s)]
*  It's not the Presidential Medal of Freedom. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=52.96s)]
*  It's right below that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=55.96s)]
*  And one of the people is Liz Cheney. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  That's who the Democrats on their way out of the White House want to spend their time [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  honoring and paying homage to. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  Here from the White House, President Biden announces recipients of the Presidential Citizen's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=69.5s)]
*  Medal, quote, the Presidential Citizen's Medal is awarded to citizens of the United States [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=77.16s)]
*  President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common decency, decency and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=82.36s)]
*  commitment to serving others. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=87.48s)]
*  The country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=89.32s)]
*  One of the people, Elizabeth L. Cheney. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=92.12s)]
*  That's Liz Cheney. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=95.44s)]
*  And here was what the White House said to justify her selection as a recipient of this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=98.12s)]
*  medal, quote, throughout two decades in public service. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  So listen, it's not just saying what she did in 2020 as part of the TV show called the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=106.84s)]
*  January 6 Committee. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=111.1s)]
*  It's saying, quote, throughout two decades in public service, going all the way back [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=112.1s)]
*  to the time when she worked with and for her father when she was one of his main-dur enthusiasts [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=116.41999999999999s)]
*  and spokesperson defending everything he was doing throughout two decades of public service [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=121.46s)]
*  at the White House, including as a congressman for Wyoming and vice chair of the committee [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=125.66s)]
*  on the January 6 attack, Liz Cheney has raised her voice and reached across the aisle to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=129.54s)]
*  defend our nation and the ideals we stand for. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=135.12s)]
*  What are those ideals that we stand for that Liz Cheney has been promoting our whole career [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=137.9s)]
*  freedom, dignity, and decency. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=141.06s)]
*  Liz Cheney's political career, says the Biden White House, has been devoted to defending [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=146.5s)]
*  freedom and dignity and decency. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=151.5s)]
*  And because we care so much about you, even though this happened very shortly before we [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=155.86s)]
*  went on air, the ceremony was held at the White House. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=159.3s)]
*  Liz Cheney, in fact, did receive her medal from Joe Biden. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=164.78s)]
*  What happened here is almost too amazing to believe. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=169.94s)]
*  I had to watch it three times to make sure I was hearing it correctly, that it was an [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=174.34s)]
*  actual genuine video. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=177.46s)]
*  Listen to how Liz Cheney is received by the Biden staffers, the Democrats, the establishment [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=180.5s)]
*  luminaries who are in the White House for this ceremony. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=186.62s)]
*  Just listen with your own ears to how she's treated. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=190.3s)]
*  Elizabeth L. Cheney, for putting the American people over party. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=193.98s)]
*  I mean, that was a sustained standing ovation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=223.98s)]
*  They were screeching in adoration. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=243.82s)]
*  It really was like teenage girls in the 1950s reacting to the arrival of Elvis Presley. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=246.17999999999998s)]
*  It was a kind of visceral, just deep-seated reaction, almost carnal. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=252.42s)]
*  I really don't think there's another politician who can invoke that level of passion and excitement [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=260.46s)]
*  in Democratic Party adherence the way Liz Cheney does. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=267.06s)]
*  I really think that if she were to suggest that she was going to run for president in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  seek the Democratic Party nomination, she would be a very formidable force. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=278.46s)]
*  They worship Liz Cheney. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=282.78s)]
*  They love Liz Cheney. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=284.94s)]
*  And of course they deny it because they know it's pathetic, they know it's embarrassing, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=288.02s)]
*  they know it says so many things they don't want to believe about themselves, about who [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=291.18s)]
*  they are and what they actually believe, what their actual ideology is. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=294.06s)]
*  You go and read any liberal magazine, any liberal newspaper, any liberal speak about [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  Liz Cheney and they are over the moon with excitement. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=304.38s)]
*  Now they might be a little critical of the strategy of the Kamala Harris campaign to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  tote her around like some mascot because it obviously didn't work. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=311.42s)]
*  But no one speaks ill of Liz Cheney on the merits of who she is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=316.62s)]
*  Mother Jones, just as one example, Mother Jones is called Mother Jones because there [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=320.5s)]
*  was a woman in the 20th century, in the early 20th century, who was a radical left-wing [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=327.26s)]
*  revolutionary who believed in revolutionary violence in order to overthrow capitalism [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=330.86s)]
*  and its excesses and install a socialist government. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=337.62s)]
*  That's the person after whom that magazine is named. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=342.1s)]
*  Now they're just totally standard Democratic Party mouthpieces and partisans. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  But in 2023, they listed their heroes of the year, heroes of the year, and one of their [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=350.14s)]
*  heroes of the year was Liz Cheney. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=356.42s)]
*  Mother Jones, if she knows that in her name, Liz Cheney is being declared a hero of the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=359.54s)]
*  year. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, I think it's so important to remember, I know a lot of you do remember, but probably [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  many of you don't, what Democrats used to say about Dick Cheney. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=374.46000000000004s)]
*  And I say what they used to say about Dick Cheney when I'm talking about Liz Cheney for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=378.94s)]
*  two reasons. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=382.02000000000004s)]
*  One is Liz Cheney only exists as a political figure because her dad was Dick Cheney. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=383.02000000000004s)]
*  But number two, Liz Cheney has never expressed a single view that deviates from her dad's. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=388.46s)]
*  All the things that made Democrats hate Dick Cheney or claim they hated Dick Cheney, call [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=395.94s)]
*  him a racist and a fascist and a uniquely dangerous figure, are all the policies that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=399.78s)]
*  Liz Cheney not only advocated, but to this very day still advocates. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=404.9s)]
*  As recently as 2018, 2020, she was defending the war in Iraq and torture and Guantanamo, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=410.26s)]
*  all of it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=415.06s)]
*  Here is Joe Biden when he was running for vice president as Barack Obama's running mate [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=417.82s)]
*  in his vice presidential debate with Sarah Palin, who at the time was John McCain's vice [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=422.18s)]
*  presidential running mate. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=429.86s)]
*  Here is what Biden in that debate on PBS had to say about Dick Cheney. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=431.62s)]
*  Vice President Cheney interpretation of the vice president. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=437.82s)]
*  Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  history. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=443.98s)]
*  He has the idea he doesn't realize that Article 1 of the Constitution defines the role of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=445.94s)]
*  vice president of the United States. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=451.86s)]
*  That's the executive. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=453.54s)]
*  He works in the executive branch. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=454.86s)]
*  He should understand that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=456.54s)]
*  Everyone should understand that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=458.06s)]
*  The only authority the vice president has from a legislative standpoint is to vote. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=459.86s)]
*  Only when there is a tie vote. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=465.2s)]
*  He has no authority relative to the Congress. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=466.98s)]
*  The idea he's part of the legislative branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=469.38s)]
*  ingrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it's gotten us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=474.34s)]
*  It has been very dangerous. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=478.73999999999995s)]
*  Let's talk the mention. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=481.17999999999995s)]
*  So that was what Joe Biden when he was running for president, when he was trying to scare [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=482.58s)]
*  Americans about Republicans, said about Dick Cheney. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=487.9s)]
*  He's a tyrant. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=491.38s)]
*  He's trying to consolidate unconstitutional power in the presidency. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=492.38s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=495.29999999999995s)]
*  He's the most dangerous vice president in American history. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  Once Joe Biden and Barack Obama won that election, Joe Biden became vice president. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=500.86s)]
*  This is what happened in 2015 from the Atlantic. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=507.02000000000004s)]
*  I wrote about this at the time as well. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=509.3s)]
*  Quote, Dick Cheney is memorialized in marble. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  The former vice president took his place at the Capitol's pantheon on Thursday. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=514.82s)]
*  So there was an event to unveil a marble bust, a statue, a sculpture of Dick Cheney. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=520.82s)]
*  And they were going to put the marble bust of him to honor him in the Capitol. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=529.98s)]
*  Joe Biden was the vice president. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=537.66s)]
*  He went to that event and did this. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=539.1s)]
*  Quote, as vice president, Joe Biden helped introduce Dick Cheney on Thursday. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=541.66s)]
*  He expressed his gratitude to the assembled crowd. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=545.82s)]

*  one another or in public, hurl insults at one another? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=567.9000000000001s)]
*  It's all theater. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=571.22s)]

*  When George Bush was the president, Nancy Pelosi was saying such vicious things about [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=578.82s)]
*  you would listen to it and you would think she was talking about Donald Trump. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  They were talking about impeaching George Bush, about how he was a war criminal. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=590.62s)]
*  And George Bush would say the same thing about Nancy Pelosi. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=595.1s)]
*  And then it turns out Nancy Pelosi's daughter does a documentary about her mom [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=599.0200000000001s)]
*  and says that one of Nancy Pelosi's best friends in Washington is and always has been [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=602.86s)]
*  George Bush and that she considers George Bush, George W. Bush, is Nancy Pelosi's daughter talking [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=608.0600000000001s)]

*  All of that was just for public show, this kind of theatrical conflict. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=617.34s)]
*  These are all part of the same establishment circles. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=620.7s)]
*  That's why Joe Biden goes and says Dick Cheney is a grave danger to the United States, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=623.4200000000001s)]
*  the most dangerous vice president in history, somebody who is a war criminal, somebody who is [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=627.5s)]
*  an unconstitutional tyrant. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=632.14s)]
*  And then just a few years later when he doesn't need to pretend anymore, he says, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=634.0600000000001s)]
*  you know what, I like Dick Cheney. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=637.6600000000001s)]
*  In 2021, Liz Cheney led the way to block the withdraw from Afghanistan [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=639.9s)]
*  that Donald Trump had negotiated and then Joe Biden was advocating. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=646.38s)]
*  Here she was on C-SPAN talking about not only why we need to keep troops in Afghanistan, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=649.98s)]
*  but the important part of this clip is that you might recall that the New York Times [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=654.38s)]
*  on its front page in an article written by its national security reporter Charlie Savage [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=659.5s)]
*  printed a claim from the CIA that turned out to be an absolute lie. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=663.5799999999999s)]
*  Right as Donald Trump was trying to withdraw from Afghanistan, the CIA released a false campaign [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=671.3399999999999s)]
*  through the New York Times, which uncritically believed it and published it on the front pages [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=679.26s)]
*  they usually do, claiming that Russia had put bounties on the heads of American soldiers. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=682.86s)]
*  They were paying the Taliban for every US soldier they could kill. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=688.86s)]
*  That it was Russia that was behind the attacks in Afghanistan. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=694.62s)]
*  Eventually even the US government admitted they had no evidence for that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=699.82s)]
*  But the idea of it, the point of it was to enable people who opposed the withdrawal [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=703.82s)]
*  of Afghanistan like Liz Cheney to cite it to say we can't leave Afghanistan because [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=707.74s)]
*  the Russians are the ones. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=712.94s)]
*  It would be basically rewarding the Russians based on this false [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=715.02s)]
*  New York Times story. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=718.54s)]
*  Here's what Liz Cheney said. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=719.26s)]
*  Let me just say we're not going to talk about classified briefings. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=721.1s)]
*  We're not going to talk about the specifics of any of those classified briefings. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=724.86s)]
*  But as ranking member Thornberry and I said yesterday in our statement, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=729.5s)]
*  we remain concerned about Russian activities in Afghanistan and around the world. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=733.02s)]
*  We're going to continue to work with the administration. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=738.22s)]
*  We anticipate additional briefings on this issue. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=741.02s)]
*  But I want to be absolutely clear that America's adversaries should know and they should have no [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=744.3s)]
*  doubt that any targeting of US forces by Russians, by anyone else, will face a very [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=749.74s)]
*  swift and deadly response. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=756.54s)]
*  The Russians experienced this in Syria in 2018 when US forces defended themselves with [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=758.9399999999999s)]
*  overwhelming and lethal force against likely Russian mercenary forces. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=764.86s)]
*  In the United States we have a free and open society. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=769.5s)]
*  We debate policy. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=772.94s)]
*  We debate these issues. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=774.22s)]
*  That is the strength of our system. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=775.5s)]
*  And that is what our adversaries, the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=778.1400000000001s)]
*  the North Koreans among them, that is what they fear the most. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  Those governments cannot allow their people the kind of free and open debate we have [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=786.0600000000001s)]
*  because they know if they allow their people to choose, they would lose power. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=790.46s)]
*  America's adversaries should never question the will. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=795.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=798.86s)]
*  So there she is yet again promoting an absolute lie to continue US wars, this one in Afghanistan. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=799.18s)]
*  While Trump was president, she teamed up with pro-war Democrats, people who get tons of [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=805.18s)]
*  money from Boeing and Northrop Grumman and Raytheon to try and defund an attempt by Donald [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=809.9s)]
*  Trump to leave Afghanistan. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=818.14s)]
*  And she cited the false story from the New York Times about bounties to do so. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=820.62s)]
*  Here she is in November of 2022, just two years ago at the University of Chicago, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=825.34s)]
*  where she was asked about her support along with her dad for invading Iraq. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=830.7s)]
*  In an effort to win your primary, you put out a campaign ad featuring your father, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=835.98s)]
*  former president, excuse me, former vice president Dick Cheney, who in his condemnation of former [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=840.22s)]
*  president Donald Trump said that, quote, a real man wouldn't lie to his supporters. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=846.3000000000001s)]
*  Now, as many will recall, your father stated as unequivocal truth narratives that at the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=851.26s)]
*  time were discredited or disputed by US intelligence to justify a bloody war with Iraq, whether, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=857.02s)]
*  you know, a war that killed hundreds of thousands more than the undoubtedly awful storming of the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=864.22s)]
*  Capitol, whether it was claiming that 9-11 hijacker Mohammed Atta met with Iraqi intelligence [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=868.62s)]
*  in Prague, that Saddam Hussein had an established operational relationship with al-Qaeda, or that [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=874.3s)]
*  Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, and the revelation of these, the falsity of these [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=880.06s)]
*  narratives led public trust in government to plummet. So how do you respond to those who believe [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=885.02s)]
*  your father's actions during his tenure as vice president eroded this trust that he holds so [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=891.3399999999999s)]
*  highly? It's such a great question because she was, of course, pontificating like every one of these [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=897.5s)]
*  Bush and Cheney officials that I know do, as though she's the defender of integrity in government [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=903.9799999999999s)]
*  against glying, that claiming that Trump is the person who's eroding trust in American institutions. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=909.74s)]
*  He's like, what are you talking about? Your dad lied the country into a war. He was disseminating [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=916.54s)]
*  claims that even the intelligence agencies were telling him in private were untrue. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=924.22s)]
*  That Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, that Iraqi agents met with Mohammed Atta to try and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=929.26s)]
*  claim that Iraq was behind the 9-11 attack, and that was what caused faith in institutions to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=934.3s)]
*  collapse. And that's exactly what happened on top of the authoritarianism that her father [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=942.6999999999999s)]
*  supported. Now, I don't believe in blaming offspring for their acts, the acts of their parents, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=950.78s)]
*  or their views of their parents, the fact that Cheney had terrible destructive ideas and a lack [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=957.42s)]
*  of character doesn't mean Liz Cheney does necessarily, but she was a defender of her [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=963.66s)]
*  father and still is to this very day. She owes her political career to that defense of those policies. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=968.06s)]
*  Here she is just two years ago in response to that question. Wrong. The president eroded this trust [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=975.1s)]
*  that he holds so highly. They're wrong. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=981.18s)]
*  She's like, that was that was her only answer. She's at first she said, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=984.3s)]
*  yeah, the people who say that about my dad are wrong. People say that my dad lied the country [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=994.3s)]
*  to war, that it was a disastrous war, that it caused trust in American government institutions, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=998.62s)]
*  deployment, they're wrong. And then a bunch of neocons in the audience here. Here's what her [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1002.9399999999999s)]
*  the rest of her answer is. You know, look, I obviously disagree with your characterization of [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1007.0999999999999s)]
*  the policies of the Bush administration and of the Iraq war, and I'm happy to have those discussions [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1014.3s)]
*  with you about that. And I think that there there's also it's important to have some facts [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1020.3s)]
*  undergirding that discussion as well, including the fact that you had senior leaders in Al Qaeda, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1026.06s)]
*  including the number two in Al Qaeda, who had been given safe haven in Iraq after 9 11 for years. So [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1031.8999999999999s)]
*  that's one part of what you laid out the notion that there's no connection between Saddam Hussein [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1040.1399999999999s)]
*  and the leaders of Al Qaeda. The extent to which Saddam Hussein violated multiple I can't remember [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1045.34s)]
*  the number now 12 or 13 United Nations National Security Council resolutions, the extent to which [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1051.1799999999998s)]
*  it was very clear, despite efforts since then to change to change the narrative that there were in [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1058.54s)]
*  fact connections between Saddam and Al Qaeda. I think it's really important to separate out [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1066.7s)]
*  policy disputes and disagreements from a president who's attempting to undermine the constitution. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1072.22s)]
*  I started my career in journalism because Bush and Cheney were trying to undermine the constitution. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1079.5800000000002s)]
*  And it is unbelievable to watch Liz Cheney just two years ago, still defend the lie [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1086.6200000000001s)]
*  that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9 11 attacks and was in an alliance with Al Qaeda at the time [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1093.82s)]
*  that the 9 11 attacks happened, still defending that war. And then Joe Biden comes out and says [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1099.1s)]
*  today that she has devoted her entire political career over two decades to decency and dignity [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1105.58s)]
*  and freedom. And those freaks in the White House start screeching with adulation. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoXU5H9fhyA&t=1111.4199999999998s)]
