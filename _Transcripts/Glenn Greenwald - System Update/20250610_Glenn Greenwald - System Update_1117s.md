# The TRUTH About Palantir CEO Alex Karp
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY)
*  Peter Thiel, most of you know him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=0.0s)]
*  He obviously supported Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020 and 2024. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=8.6s)]
*  He decided he wouldn't, though he has become, he's very, very close to JD Vance. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=12.64s)]
*  JD Vance's personal wealth is due to his work with Peter Thiel and Thiel played a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  major role in financing JD Vance's Senate run in Ohio and also in securing Donald Trump's endorsement for JD Vance and what was a very contested Republican primary. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=25.76s)]
*  Obviously Trump's endorsement Republican primary is essentially dispositive. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  So JD Vance owes a lot of his career, he's very close allies to Peter Thiel, one of the founders of Palantir. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=42.32s)]
*  But at this point, Peter Thiel's involvement in Palantir is quite minimal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=48.88s)]
*  The person who really runs Palantir is Alex Karp. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  And despite the fact that he's worth many billions of dollars and runs this extremely influential and increasingly menacing deep state entity that is becoming particularly powerful within the Trump administration, very little attention has been paid to him in terms of who he is and what he thinks. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=60.2s)]
*  But I think with the growing influence of Palantir, the kind of realization of the apex of its aspirations to become the omnipotent provider of government surveillance and the technology that runs it and the data that collects it, he's become very emboldened. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=79.39999999999999s)]
*  He's been speaking a lot more publicly about his belief system, the agenda that he believes in, the ideology he pursues. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=95.4s)]
*  He's far from some sort of neutral or apolitical technologist. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=104.36s)]
*  Very much the opposite. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=108.36s)]
*  He is a hardcore neocon, as devoted of a loyalist to Israel as it gets. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=110.36s)]
*  He very much believes in the virtues and necessity of American war and American power and makes very clear that the goal of Palantir is to serve that and maximize it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  So I just want to show you a little bit about Alex Karp, the person who really is the sole controller and manager of Palantir, the company that, as we just showed you, is now playing such a central role, almost unprecedentedly powerful role, in America's deep state and in its intelligence apparatus and security state. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=128.76s)]
*  So we're from May of 2025 to just last month, as Alex Karp, he was doing an event at the Ash Carter Exchange, and here's part of what he said. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=150.76s)]
*  All right, here is Alex Karp speaking on CNBC. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=180.92s)]
*  I just want to kind of show you what he speaks about, what he prioritizes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=190.92s)]
*  Here he is proclaiming anti-Semitism in the United States, particularly the college protest against Israel, to be one of the greatest problems, and here's a decree that he issued about all of that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=196.92s)]
*  Most of America is horrified by what happened on October 7th. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  Almost everyone in America is horrified by the dramatic rise of anti-Semitism, which does not receive the reaction it deserves. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  And most Americans would like to see leadership on the Middle East, on bringing hostages home, especially American hostages, and clear statements about discrimination, even discrimination against Jews. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  I feel, though, I think part of the reason why leaders need to stand up is this is a very, very, very small minority of America. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=238.24s)]
*  They succeed in having an outsized impact simply because the rest of America thinks they're so idiotic that this can't actually be dangerous or true. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=246.24s)]
*  But it is dangerous, and they do believe these things. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=257.24s)]
*  And if we do not speak up, they will continue to tell themselves this, and there will be a sense on their side that it's okay to push the boundaries and push the boundaries and push the boundaries. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  And so as heinous as what these people are saying is, it exists in part because there are not enough people saying this is really dumb, this is hatred, and it will not be tolerated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  It would be, I think, sinister enough if somebody just completely apolitical was at the helm of a privatized surveillance state as expansive and powerful and virtually limitless as Palantir now is. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=282.56s)]
*  But to have somebody who views protest movements against a foreign government to which he's loyal, Israel, harbors so much contempt and so much hatred for the people who are those protesters, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=296.72s)]
*  does it seem like he's somebody who is inclined to use this surveillance power or in this data in very neutral and apolitical ways, or do you think he's somebody who feels so passionately about things like Israel that that information in his hands would almost certainly be weaponized against those who he thinks are advocating an ideology that he regards as evil or dangerous? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=312.88000000000005s)]
*  I think the question to ask the question is to answer it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=340.04s)]
*  Here from the New York Post, more on Alex Karp, the Palantir CEO says that the Columbia protesters should do, quote, exchange program in North Korea. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=342.04s)]
*  Just to give you a sense of Peter Thiel, Peter Thiel in November of 2024, and as I said, he doesn't run the company, but he still is influential within Palantir. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  He spoke with, you'll never guess who, Barry Weiss, and she asked him about, you'll never guess what, Israel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  And here's what Peter Thiel said about his view of the U.S. and Israel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=378.36s)]
*  I don't think the U.S. and Israel are, you know, perfectly in sync, but I do think that if we simply deferred to Israel and on things related to the Middle East, we'd have a far saner policy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=380.36s)]
*  We'd have a far more realistic policy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=400.36s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=402.36s)]
*  So that's their view is. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=404.36s)]
*  That's Peter Thiel's view is. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=406.36s)]
*  So let's defer to Israel. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  Look, we're not always going to be on the same page, but the best thing to do, defer to Israel. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  Have Israel tell us what they want and give it to them. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  Have Israel tell us what they want us to do and do it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  Let's just defer to Israel and we'll be much better off. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  In late 2023, Palantir announced a policy which you would think would have created a lot of anger and opposition among the American right because it was as pure of an example of what is now called DEI or job set-asides, as you could possibly imagine. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=423.68s)]
*  And yet people like Ben Shapiro and Barry Weiss both instantly cheered it as soon as it was announced because it's the kind of DEI that they really like. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  But it also shows you how Palantir thinks as well, which again is an important thing to understand given the power that they've now amassed. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  Ben Shapiro ultimately kind of backtracked a little bit when his own followers began saying, what do you mean? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  How are you cheering for DEI and job set-asides for specific minority groups when you've been claiming to oppose that your whole life? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  But here is Palantir's announcement. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=475.0s)]
*  Quote, Palantir is offering an opportunity to students looking to flee anti-Semitism on campus. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=478.0s)]
*  Quote, we at Palantir have been committed to defending the principle that make democratic rule possible since our founding two decades ago. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=484.0s)]
*  Our software embodies our values and commitments. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=491.0s)]
*  These include high performance, efficiency, transparency, fairness, and a rejection of narrow thinking, including fear and skepticism of the other and outright bigotry. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=494.0s)]
*  We believe these values must be backed up by action on the battlefield, intellectual and otherwise, given the egregious levels of anti-Semitism in our society, especially at our most elite educational institutions. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=503.16s)]
*  Some of these organizations seem structurally incapable of taking any steps to reform themselves. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=516.16s)]
*  Students on campuses are terrified and have been instructed by administrators to hide their Judaism. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=521.16s)]
*  We are launching an initiative for students who, because of anti-Semitism, fear for their safety on campus and need to seek refuge outside traditional establishments of higher education. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  They are welcome to join Palantir and we are setting aside 180 positions for them immediately. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  They created 180 jobs available not based on merit, not open to everybody who competes based on merit in the United States. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=548.48s)]
*  They created 180 jobs available exclusively to Jewish students who claim that they are endangered. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=561.48s)]
*  Exactly the kind of DEI programs where you say black people have been historically oppressed and feel endangered in society or are untreated fairly, therefore we're going to create 80 jobs only for black people. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=569.64s)]
*  And everyone in the conservative movement or anything adjacent to it goes absolutely crazy, sues over it, says it's illegal, says it's immoral, says it's racist. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=583.64s)]
*  And here is Palantir doing exactly the same thing but only for Jewish students. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=593.8s)]
*  I think indicating the ideology of the people including Alex Karp who run this now extremely powerful centralized corporation that collects and maintains and does whatever it wants with all of your personal data from the IRS to HHS to Homeland Security and everything in between. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=598.8s)]
*  Here was Alex Karp quoted in the Hill and Valley in the Hill and Valley Forum where he was speaking about Israel and the role that Palantir plays in the Israeli attack on Gaza which is significant. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=617.9599999999999s)]
*  And he was asked basically what about the role you're playing and the number of civilians being killed and here's what he said. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  That a few people get wealthy and if you said platitudes that were obviously stupid you could... [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=641.12s)]
*  You're getting wealthy off of killing Palestinians with Palantir killed Palestinians with their AI and technology. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=646.12s)]
*  You're killing my family in Palestine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=653.12s)]
*  How do you sleep at night? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=656.12s)]
*  Do you want to hear my answer? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=658.12s)]
*  Sure, go ahead. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=661.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=662.12s)]
*  I think the primary cause of death for Palestinians... [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=663.28s)]
*  Okay, do you want to hear the answer or do you want to go? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=666.28s)]
*  Well, you don't want to hear an answer. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=669.28s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=672.28s)]
*  So the primary source of death in Palestine is the fact that Hamas has realized that there are millions and millions of people who are killed in Palestine. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=673.28s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  So the primary source of death in Palestine is the fact that Hamas has realized that there are millions and millions of useful idiots that will... [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  You've been bad excuse. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  This is why you're a peanut flask. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  Because you are killing my people and you're justifying it because of Hamas or anyone else. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  Can we get security up there? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  How dare you use your AI and technology from Palantir to kill Palestinians? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  Mostly terrorists. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=711.6s)]
*  That's true. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=712.6s)]
*  No! [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=713.6s)]
*  She believes I'm evil. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=714.6s)]
*  I believe she's an unwitting product of an evil force, Hamas. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=715.6s)]
*  That she unwittingly is part of their strategy. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=720.6s)]
*  That she is a product. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=723.6s)]
*  And the most important thing, arguably, in the book or what Palantir or what you could learn is do not become a product of an ideology that sounds sensible. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=725.6s)]
*  Now, I want to emphasize that although we've been focused on Palantir's intelligence collection, one of the things they do is they are developing AI products designed to be used on the battlefield. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=735.76s)]
*  And this is actually a story we reported on previously at the Intercept as part of the Snowden documents. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=744.76s)]
*  I worked on it with my colleague Jeremy Scahill that artificial intelligence or algorithmic analysis was being increasingly used to decide in the Obama administration who would live and who would die with the drone program. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=750.76s)]
*  So they would assign this program with points to people based on who they talked to or in what proximity they were to other people considered by the program to be bad. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=763.92s)]
*  And if you got enough points, you were deemed eligible for the kill list. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=774.92s)]
*  These were not human intelligence assets. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=779.92s)]
*  Giving information, these were purely algorithmic assessments that ultimately have now become more sophisticated with artificial intelligence. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=782.92s)]
*  It's one of the things Palantir is working on. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=789.92s)]
*  And one of the things we were able to discover was that Al Dazeer journalists who interviewed terrorists were not differentiated under this program. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  A lot of them had very high point totals that made them eligible to be killed, even though they weren't plotting with terrorists. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=801.0799999999999s)]
*  They were interviewing people deemed to be adversaries by the U.S. government. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's why I say a lot of this technology is extremely dangerous. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean we should ban it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=816.24s)]
*  Probably other people are developing it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=821.24s)]
*  But you need serious safeguards on it to make sure that it's not being abused or pursued for political ends. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=822.24s)]
*  And here you see somebody who's as politicized, who's as loyal to a foreign country and therefore antagonistic to those who criticize the foreign country in the United States as you could possibly imagine. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=830.24s)]
*  And he's the person amassing this massive power, not just of information, but also increasingly of military weaponry. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=843.4s)]
*  Here he spoke at the Reagan Presidential Foundation in December of 2024 and shared some of his philosophy about how the West needs to maintain dominance. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=854.4s)]
*  Americans are the most loving, God-fearing, fair, least discriminatory people on the planet. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=864.4s)]
*  And they want to know that if you're waking up and thinking about harming American citizens, or if American citizens are taken hostage and kept in dungeons, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=870.56s)]
*  or if you're a foreign power sending fentanyl to poison our people, something really bad is going to happen to you and your friends and your cousins and your bank account and your mistress and whoever was involved. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=880.56s)]
*  And you know, when Americans are spending a trillion dollars on defense, what I know, what I want, and what I think my peers want is, why are these people keeping our citizens hostage, torturing our people, attacking our allies, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=892.7199999999999s)]
*  maligning us in what was once called the United Nations, basically a discriminatory institution against anything good? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=908.7199999999999s)]
*  We need to stand up and those people need to be scared. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=914.88s)]
*  And that's why this conference is so important, because we have the best products in the world and we cannot have parity. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=917.88s)]
*  Our adversaries do not have our moral compunction. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=925.88s)]
*  If it's even, they will take advantage of our niceness, kindness, our desire to be at home in Nebraska or New Hampshire or wherever we are. Americans are the... [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=928.88s)]
*  So people like Alice Karp are very benevolent, very kind, very loving, very considerate, very fair. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=937.04s)]
*  But the people who think differently than him, those are monstrous people. They live without ethics. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=944.04s)]
*  And as a result, we need to make sure that we develop the intel programs and the weaponization programs to keep the people who we regard as adversaries in fear of us. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=950.04s)]
*  And it's pure James Bond villain talk, sociopathic talk, which you could dismiss if not for the fact that he really is in a position where he's able to oversee the programs that will actually do that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=962.1999999999999s)]
*  Here's a little bit more of him talking about how he thinks social change of the kind that he wants in the United States should be effectuated. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=976.1999999999999s)]
*  He's speaking at the Economic Club on May 22nd, just a little bit ago. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=985.36s)]
*  And as I said, he's becoming more emboldened in speaking out publicly about just how extremist his ideology is, just how politicized he is after years of kind of obscuring and hiding and remaining a mysterious figure. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=991.36s)]
*  Here he is talking about how he wants to effectuate the social change he believes in. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1005.52s)]
*  It's the most effective way for social change is humiliate your enemy and make them poorer. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1017.52s)]
*  And that's how social change actually happens. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1023.52s)]
*  So the way social change happens is that you take the people you disagree with, your enemies, and you humiliate them and you make them poorer. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1029.68s)]
*  He was talking before about how if you're against him, how if you believe in a cause he doesn't believe in, he thinks that not only you but your family and your mistress all should be revealed and should be punished. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1043.68s)]
*  They should have their bank accounts taken away. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1053.68s)]
*  Isn't this the kind of authoritarianism that we have been concerned about, have been objecting to, have been denouncing for so many years the idea that if you have beliefs that people in power dislike that you can have private information about you disclosed to humiliate you, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  that you can have your bank accounts stripped from you, that basically dissent can be crushed. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1076.0s)]
*  And that's what he's saying is that we need to make sure that people who dissent live in fear of what we can do to them. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1082.0s)]
*  This is who Alex Clark is. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1wz_jAURZY&t=1088.0s)]
