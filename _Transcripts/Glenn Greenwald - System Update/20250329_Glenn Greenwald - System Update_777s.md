# Is an Anti-War Party Possible?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns)
*  All right, the next question is from The Millman who asked, hey Glenn, do you think the pro-Palestine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=0.0s)]
*  protests would have gained more MAGA sympathy if they were also explicitly against funding [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=10.96s)]
*  the Ukraine war? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=16.2s)]
*  Just wondering because I've come to believe that appealing to people's consciences is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=17.44s)]
*  not effective, particularly when the media is against your cause. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=21.72s)]
*  It just comes off as moralizing without the drumbeat of propaganda on your side. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=24.52s)]
*  So maybe a broader anti-interventionist protest that unites left and right might have been [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=29.2s)]
*  more effective. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=32.96s)]
*  What more of a quote, what good does it do us ordinary Americans to have all these people [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=33.96s)]
*  killed movement? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Quote, are we safer? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Are we richer? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=40.76s)]
*  I think it's a very interesting point and I would say that question describes the approach [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=43.44s)]
*  that I have been trying to take myself and my own journalism and kind of the areas that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=50.2s)]
*  I have focused on, this kind of common ground between populist left and populist right, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  anti-establishment left and anti-establishment right, which includes not only opposition [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  to the US financing and arming the Israeli destruction of Gaza, but also the US financing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=65.44s)]
*  and fueling the war in Ukraine and just the general militaristic war, endless war posture [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=71.32s)]
*  that the United States is on that I think does no Americans any good except for a tiny [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=78.32s)]
*  sliver of elites who run these industries that profit so much at everybody else's expense. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=82.56s)]
*  And so I do think that had these protests been more generalized against the US war machine [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=89.12s)]
*  and heightened Ukraine as an example as well, it may have attracted a broader base of support. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  But let me just say a couple things about that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=103.76s)]
*  Because I'm not entirely sure in this case if that's true. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=105.68s)]
*  I understand it in theory. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=108.44s)]
*  I think it has potential. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  But I think it's so important not to underestimate the enormous hold that Israel has on a large [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=112.92s)]
*  swath of our political spectrum. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=125.28s)]
*  And not just our political spectrum, but American conservatism and even large parts of MAGA. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=130.12s)]
*  In fact, it is often the case, I really do believe, that a lot of the sentiments in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=137.04s)]
*  defense of Israel are even stronger than the sentiments in defense of the United States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=144.32s)]
*  And one of the things I, obviously if you go back and read the Israel lobby by John [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=149.32s)]
*  Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt from 2007, it details a lot of that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=156.76s)]
*  But I think one of the things that has happened is, I say this in Brazil, I'll just explain [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  in Brazil. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=166.56s)]
*  In Brazil, Brazil used to be an overwhelmingly Catholic country, the largest Catholic country [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  in the world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=172.8s)]
*  And it still is very Catholic, at least in the sense of who identifies as a Catholic. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=174.24s)]
*  But Catholics tend not to be particularly devout or driven by religion. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=179.0s)]
*  It's just kind of a religion of Brazil, like Christianity is the religion of the United [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=183.4s)]
*  States. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=188.0s)]
*  Some people are very devout. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=189.0s)]
*  But by and large, it would be a secular society with kind of Christian-informed values. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=190.0s)]
*  Or Catholic-informed values. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=196.4s)]
*  But over the last three or four decades, there's been this emergence of a very passionate and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=198.72s)]
*  intense evangelical movement. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=203.84s)]
*  And there's always been evangelicals around, but it's only quite recently where evangelicals [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=207.52s)]
*  have been convinced that one of their highest religious duties is to politically support [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=212.4s)]
*  Israel and support everything it does and want to fund it with great enthusiasm. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  So if you go to a protest or a march or demonstration organized by the Brazilian right, you'll [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=225.84s)]
*  see at least as many Israel flags as you will Brazilian flags because Israel plays such [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=232.36s)]
*  a central role, central role, defining central role in how right-wing evangelical politics [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=239.36s)]
*  are expressed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=248.76s)]
*  In fact, there's this, just as a side note, there's this interesting anecdote where there's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  this drug gang, this drug gang that kind of rules the favelas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  They constantly fight for expansion. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=263.68s)]
*  And the head of this gang is devoutly evangelical, demands that everybody in his communities [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=266.8s)]
*  that he runs be evangelical, and he united a bunch of the communities that he gained [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=271.44s)]
*  power over. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=275.36s)]
*  And so they called it the Complex of Israel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  And all over the place there are stars of David and Israeli flags. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=279.56s)]
*  They use the uniforms of the IDF. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=283.56s)]
*  That is how central Israel has become in the evangelical mindset. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=287.48s)]
*  And so if you look at a major part of the U.S. Congress, obviously you have American [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  Jews who are inculcated from birth to revere Israel. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=299.64s)]
*  And then you have national security hawks who just see Israel as an important instrument [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=303.62s)]
*  or extension of American power. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=309.08s)]
*  But you also have huge parts of the MAGA movement that are composed of evangelicals who will [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=310.68s)]
*  tell you outright they don't want to give money to any other country in the world, they [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=317.68s)]
*  don't want to defend any other country in the world except for Israel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's because God has mandated that they defend Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=324.8s)]
*  Some of them believe that Israel has to be unified under the control of the Jews for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  the Messiah to return, at which time he will actually consign all Jews because they don't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=334.32s)]
*  accept the divinity of Jesus to eternal damnation, but Jews are happy to accept that support [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  because they don't actually believe that will happen. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  But others just have a more generalized view of the book of Exodus and some of the chapters [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=349.2s)]
*  of what we call the Old Testament that God promised Israel to the Jews and said that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=354.12s)]
*  whoever defends and supports and blesses the Jewish people in Israel will themselves be [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=360.24s)]
*  blessed. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  So when I met a genuine religious conviction on the part of evangelicals or a deeply embedded, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  namely indoctrinated identification with Israel among American Jews, then it isn't so easy [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=380.0s)]
*  to just say, oh yeah, they're going to start being okay with these protests against the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  Israeli destruction of Gaza as long as we just throw Ukraine in as well. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  Because I just, I mean, I see the emotion, I see the emotion in people when you talk [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=396.68s)]
*  about this issue. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  It's unlike almost any other. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  For a lot of people, this is the red line, the single greatest issue and not a small [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=405.26s)]
*  number of people, a large number of people. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=409.22s)]
*  Now obviously there's a lot of Jews who are highly critical of Israel. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=412.58000000000004s)]
*  They participated and led the protests. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=415.38000000000005s)]
*  Obviously this show hosted by myself is highly critical of Israel and I was taught all the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=418.46000000000004s)]
*  same things about Israel that other American Jews were from birth. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=423.94000000000005s)]
*  And there are evangelicals who don't mix their religion with their politics, especially [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  on foreign. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=432.3s)]
*  But I'm saying in general, it is such a dominant issue. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=433.3s)]
*  You can pretty much in these factions take any position at all and they'll be fine with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=438.76s)]
*  it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=443.32s)]
*  You can disagree with them about almost anything. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=444.32s)]
*  People may go, okay, this is just, you disagree with them about this and they will write you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=445.32s)]
*  off because this, this foreign country is the highest and most sacred duty. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=449.64s)]
*  And it's so ironic that there's so many people who identify as America first for whom this [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=456.52s)]
*  is true. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  Obviously huge parts of Maga in America first don't see Israel this way, but many, many [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  of them do. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=467.08000000000004s)]
*  The other problem is that a lot of people on the left, broadly speaking, by the left [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=469.6s)]
*  I kind of mean that just like the left or wing of the Democratic Party. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=475.88s)]
*  I don't mean like the hardcore leftists who would never support the Democratic Party. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean like the mainstream people who are called left, like the Bernie Sanders, AOC, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=483.0s)]
*  even a little inward toward the mainstream get called the left. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=488.32000000000005s)]
*  They unanimously almost overwhelmingly support Ukraine and support the NATO war in Ukraine [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=493.18s)]
*  and want the United States to continue to fund it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=499.18s)]
*  So if you were to introduce a Ukraine element into these protests, it would alienate a huge [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=502.22s)]
*  number of people who don't support that at all. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=510.5s)]
*  These should combine. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=513.62s)]
*  I absolutely agree that opposing the US financing and funding and arming and diplomatic protection [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=514.62s)]
*  of Israel should lead you to the conclusion that the US should stop doing the same thing [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=522.34s)]
*  with respect to Ukraine. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=528.98s)]
*  Now obviously people would say, oh they're totally different. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=530.22s)]
*  Ukraine is the aggressor and Israel is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim of an [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=534.02s)]
*  aggression so we should defend the victims of aggression which is Ukraine. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  Obviously people have a different view on that as well. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=544.38s)]
*  But it's just a very difficult, it's a difficult group of views to mix because it would alienate [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=547.18s)]
*  so many people one way or the other and I'm not sure that if the focus was on Israel or [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=555.9799999999999s)]
*  Israel was a major part, it would really become tolerable for all those people for whom Israel [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=559.5s)]
*  plays such a vital role. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=566.14s)]
*  And then I guess the last thing I would say about this is that I really don't think you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  compare the war in Ukraine to the war on Gaza. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=575.82s)]
*  They're not even remotely comparable in terms of civilians killed, in terms of the destruction [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=580.82s)]
*  that it's ushering in, in terms of the humanitarian crimes and the atrocities and the war criminality. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  I really think that what the Israelis are doing in Gaza, especially with the resumption [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=598.94s)]
*  now of this bombing campaign when there was barely anything left to bomb, just the absolute [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  indiscriminate slaughter and killing, the complete destruction of civilian life in Gaza, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=609.0s)]
*  blowing up every hospital, every university and I know all the arguments Hamas was there, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=615.0799999999999s)]
*  etc. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=620.48s)]
*  But I think that what we're witnessing in Gaza is by far the worst atrocity certainly [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  of the century and I could make a case in my lifetime. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=628.76s)]
*  I mean try not to be too maximalist about it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=634.24s)]
*  There's a recency bias. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=636.36s)]
*  There's been a lot of massacres and slaughters in the last several decades. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=637.36s)]
*  But I would certainly say that about this century because there's just zero constraints [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=644.48s)]
*  of any kind that are observed. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=651.68s)]
*  Zero regard for human life among Palestinians. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=654.2s)]
*  And it's been so sustained. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=659.24s)]
*  The Gazans are basically helpless. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=661.7600000000001s)]
*  They don't have an army. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=663.2s)]
*  They don't have NATO behind them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=664.2s)]
*  They don't have aircraft being shipped to them. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  They have very primitive weapons that make them able sort of to fight a guerilla campaign [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  but not regard against. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=676.7600000000001s)]
*  It's basically a sitting duck population, a helpless population. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=678.32s)]
*  So I understand why people felt a particular need to go out and protest that, especially [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=681.74s)]
*  because our government is who is paying for it, who is arming it, who is diplomatically [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=688.74s)]
*  shielding it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=692.26s)]
*  So it's a complicated question but I do wish a lot that people would be more open to the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=693.46s)]
*  idea that there really are huge common ground among left-wing populists and right-wing populists. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=699.14s)]
*  And the problem is that people on the right, including right-wing populists, are taught [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=705.28s)]
*  to hate anything on the left and left-wing populists are taught to hate anything on the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=710.38s)]
*  right. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=713.62s)]
*  And that was why my attempt to examine and foster this common ground on issues like trade [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=714.98s)]
*  and war and intelligence community and military industrial complex and corporatism alienated [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=724.1s)]
*  so many people on the left because the idea that there could be anybody on the right who [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=731.38s)]
*  has views that they would want to, that they could connect to or that they could work with [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=734.38s)]
*  is so anathema to how people have been indoctrinated to think and just stay over here in their [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=739.58s)]
*  separate corners. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=743.9s)]
*  And so yes, I wish there was a lot more thinking along these lines but unfortunately we're [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=745.66s)]
*  pretty far away from that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3f12QCzfns&t=748.86s)]
