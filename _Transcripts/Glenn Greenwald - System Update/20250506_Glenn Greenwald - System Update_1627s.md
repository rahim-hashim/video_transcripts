# Fauci's Brutal Dog Experiments ENDED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k)
*  Justin Goodman is the Senior Vice President of Advocacy and Public Policy at White's Great [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=0.0s)]
*  Coast Waste, the nonpartisan nonprofit organization that just got done heralding and explaining [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=11.9s)]
*  it exposed and has held Dr. Fauci accountable for many things, including funding the Wuhan [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  as well as testing cruel, gratuitous, and pointless testing on dogs generally and beagles [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=25.84s)]
*  specifically. For more than two decades, Justin has led successful and award-winning grassroots [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=32.72s)]
*  and the lobbying campaigns to end cruel taxpayer-funded experiments on dogs, cats, primates, and other [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=37.8s)]
*  animals. I've long been an admirer of that group and of his work, and we're really delighted [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=44.68s)]
*  to have him join us tonight. Justin, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for coming [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=49.6s)]
*  on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=53.08s)]
*  It's an honor to be here. Longtime listener, first-time caller. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. I can say the same to you. All right. So before we get into the specifics [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=57.88s)]
*  of what happened today, what this program was about, other programs that you've been [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=63.64s)]
*  working on, I want to talk a little bit about your organization because so many political [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  advocacy groups, when they begin, when they get into their work, say, oh, we're going [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=74.4s)]
*  to try and make this so that it's not a right-wing issue, it's not a left-wing issue. It doesn't [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=77.88s)]
*  matter right or left. It's just, you know, the cause is just and it should unite everybody. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=82.64s)]
*  Everyone says that. Very few groups succeed in actually doing that. And yet, as the reaction [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=87.52s)]
*  to your victory today demonstrates, with huge numbers of people across the political spectrum [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=93.56s)]
*  in Washington, you know, MAGA people and traditional Republicans and centrists, a few liberals [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=98.44s)]
*  as well, celebrating this victory in all sorts of ways, what has your plan been in order [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=103.2s)]
*  to accomplish that? And why do you think you've succeeded where others have failed? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  That's a great question. I mean, White Coat was started over a decade ago by my friend, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  my boss, the founder of our group, Anthony Bellotti, who came out of Republican politics. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=121.68s)]
*  And actually, the way he got involved in this issue to begin with is he worked in a taxpayer [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=125.64000000000001s)]
*  funded animal laboratory as a teenager. He thought he wanted to go to medical school [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=129.88s)]
*  and he got an internship at a local hospital in New York City. Didn't know what the job [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=134.88s)]
*  was going to be. It turns out it was a lab that was torturing pigs and cardiac experiments. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=139.08s)]
*  And he quit after a few weeks. He was just horrified by what he saw. Went into politics [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=143.4s)]
*  and went into ended up working on a number of high profile defund campaigns and connected [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=147.68s)]
*  the dots. He was like, oh, my God, I could be using the same strategies and tactics that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  the GOP is using to defund other programs they don't like to attack government animal [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  testing. Because a lot of people don't realize that the U.S. government is the single largest [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  funder of animal testing, not only in the country, in the world. About $20 billion [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=168.48s)]
*  of our tax money is spent each year, wasted each year on animal experiments. So he had [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  this idea for a new organization that brought the issue back to the center where it belongs. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=177.72s)]
*  This is, you know, ending animal experimentation didn't begin as a liberal issue. It was actually [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=182.72s)]
*  a very, very bipartisan issue. It was back 150 years in the United States and it was [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=187.48s)]
*  always something that attracted people from all ends of the political and social spectrum. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=192.12s)]
*  But because of the nature of the organizations that ended up kind of commandeering it in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=197.24s)]
*  the 70s and 80s and 90s like PETA, it became a very far left issue that people on the center [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=201.56s)]
*  and right just did not identify with. It was an organ, you know, associated with organizations [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=207.8s)]
*  that wanted to ban and tax everything. And they saw as, you know, food, police, gun grabbers. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=212.08s)]
*  And as a result, issues that could get traction across the political spectrum, like animal [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=217.86s)]
*  testing, which is truly a nonpartisan issue, it was getting caught up in kind of the people's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=223.12s)]
*  concerns about the broader animal rights agenda. And rightfully so. I listen, we live in a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=228.28s)]
*  very diverse country. 1% of the country is vegan. Most people aren't. So how do you meet [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  everyone else where they're at? And the idea was to unite folks, we like to say liberty [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=237.84s)]
*  lovers and animal lovers. So people who are concerned with animal welfare, people who [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=242.44s)]
*  are concerned with government waste, or folks who are concerned about both, and bring them [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  together to get make some actual change for animals and laboratories. Because despite [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=249.88s)]
*  50 years of work by establishment groups, the number of animals and labs had gone up. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=253.48s)]
*  The amount of money that was being wasted by the government and labs had gone up. So [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=259.12s)]
*  we saw an opportunity to really break in there and widen the tent, create a group that had [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=264.36s)]
*  no litmus test and a fanatically single issue focus on just getting animals out of government [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=270.28s)]
*  labs. So as an organization, our position is we don't want to ban animal testing. Most [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=276.4s)]
*  of it's taxpayer funded. We'll cut the funding for the two thirds of animal testing in this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=280.32s)]
*  country that is paid for by taxpayers. And then the challenge to them is let the private [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=285.08s)]
*  sector fund it. And guess what? They're not going to. No private company or foundation [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=289.84s)]
*  in their right mind is going to pay to put puppies on treadmills and give them heart [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=295.0s)]
*  attacks until they collapse. I mean, the type of things that the government's funding has [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  no return on investment for a company or for public health. So no one's going to pay for [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=303.4s)]
*  it. So that was our challenge. And we were able to then unite people, small government [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  folks who wanted to cut spending and also liked animals with more traditional people [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=311.08s)]
*  on the left who wanted to get animals out of laboratories and bring them together and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=314.88s)]
*  build this very robust bipartisan coalition of people in the freedom caucus, the squad [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=318.44s)]
*  and everyone in between to fight against government funded animal tests. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=324.32s)]
*  I want to talk about the specifics of this kind of last standing program that you helped [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=329.0s)]
*  pressure the government to close. And specifically, we obviously have a new set of officials at [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=336.0s)]
*  HHS, including RFK Jr. and David Batara at NIH. But I just want to focus a little bit [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=341.08s)]
*  more on the kind of reason why this succeeded. Because I've been around for a long time watching [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=346.12s)]
*  Washington and advocacy groups. And these kinds of wins really don't come easily. And [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=350.48s)]
*  when they happen, they're often a byproduct of very well thought through and executed [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=355.84s)]
*  strategies. But there's also some component of it that for whatever reason breaks through [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=360.4s)]
*  all the other issues and activist groups. And I'm sort of interested in this one because [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=366.11999999999995s)]
*  just my own personal experience growing up, I absolutely loved dogs. I just had an affinity [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=371.64s)]
*  for them from the time I was very young. It opened up things for me that I don't think [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=376.55999999999995s)]
*  were difficult to open up, that maybe whatever would have had been for dogs. And I always [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=384.56s)]
*  knew I wanted to have a gigantic space with tons of rescue dogs which I now have. So they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=389.16s)]
*  always played an important part of my life. But what they also did was having this kind [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=393.36s)]
*  of love for dogs, this appreciation for what it means to be a sentient being, this majesty [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=398.08s)]
*  that these animals possess. It kind of became the gateway for me to then thinking about [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=404.84000000000003s)]
*  other animals. I've been meat eater my whole life. I didn't care where the food was coming [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=410.32s)]
*  from. It's all hidden how it's made so we don't think about it. But most people don't [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=413.92s)]
*  need to do any work to think about what pigs are, what cows are, how sophisticated they [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=419.32s)]
*  are or whatever because they know their dogs. So I'm wondering, do you think that was an [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=425.04s)]
*  important component of this? That this is not just animal testing generically but specifically [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=430.64s)]
*  testing on dogs which most people have in their lives and a breed of dogs that in the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  most sadistic way was chosen because of how trusting and loving they are and beagles? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=440.88s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And actually we can trace back the victory that was announced yesterday [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=444.88s)]
*  to at the very beginning of our campaign in 2016 focused on dogs. But I just want to say [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=451.24s)]
*  that's part of how White Coat launched and that's why we chose focusing on dogs when [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=455.8s)]
*  we first put out our campaigns in 2016 is I felt like we felt like as an organization [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=459.72s)]
*  that the big groups running the show at the time had kind of lost the plot. That they [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=465.52s)]
*  were all in on anti-speciesism and a rat is a mouse is a dog. And whether that's morally [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  accurate or not, in real life that's not how things are. We have a nation of dog lovers, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=475.2s)]
*  two thirds of this country has a dog or a cat in their household and considers them [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=480.52s)]
*  members of the family. And to build an effective social movement, sure part of it's, you know, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=484.44s)]
*  idealistic thinking about what the world could be but you also have to accept where it is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=489.52s)]
*  and then find common ground with people to kind of build that future you want to see [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  and not operate as if that's the way things are now. So we accepted that this is a nation [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=498.08s)]
*  of dog lovers, a nation of cat lovers, people who love their pets. So let's meet them where [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=502.76s)]
*  they're at and start there. A lot of the other groups have moved on and assumed that somehow [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=506.68s)]
*  the dog and cat issue would just fix itself and they can just work on mice and rat issues [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=511.0s)]
*  because there's many more of them in laboratories. And as a result, dogs and cats got left in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=515.4s)]
*  the lurch and there was no one really advocating for them. So when we launched in 2016, we [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=519.08s)]
*  made a tactical and strategic decision to start, let's bring the focus to dogs. This is a way [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=523.48s)]
*  to bring people in the left, the right center together, bring people across this country together [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=529.32s)]
*  for fighting for a common cause. And we released a report called Spending to Death and this was in [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=533.4s)]
*  November of 2016. It actually came out right after Trump was elected in the 2016 election. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=537.72s)]
*  And we put out this report focusing on what the federal government was doing to dogs in its own [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=544.76s)]
*  laboratories. So to your point, the government funds a lot of animal experimentation in colleges, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=550.12s)]
*  universities, private companies, but also conducts a lot of animal experimentation in its own [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=555.4s)]
*  laboratories. So we were focusing on what's the government doing in-house thinking if we can make [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=559.4s)]
*  reforms there, then we can use that success to build a campaign to then apply those successes [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=563.64s)]
*  outwards towards these non-governmental targets like the colleges and universities that were [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=569.0s)]
*  getting government money. So we released this report and two of the projects that we focused [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=573.64s)]
*  on back in 2016 were one, a program that was being done in Fauci's own laboratory [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=577.56s)]
*  right outside of Washington, D.C. in Maryland where they were covering beagle puppies [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=585.4799999999999s)]
*  and biting flies and then taking photographs of the lesions and wounds that the dogs are suffering [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=589.8s)]
*  from as a result. And these were maximum pain experiments, meaning they caused the pain and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=594.52s)]
*  distress to these dogs and they completely withheld pain relief intentionally. The other lab we [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  focused on at the NIH was the lab that was just shut down, which was a septic shock laboratory. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=604.2s)]
*  And this one had gone on for 40 years, killed over 2,100 puppies according to our calculations [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  and documents we got through FOIA. And what they were doing in that lab is that they would take [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  bacteria that caused pneumonia, pump it into the puppy's lungs to make them sick, and then slice [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=619.48s)]
*  their arteries to cause them to bleed out and put them into septic shock and then do experiments on [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=624.76s)]
*  them and see how many of the dogs would survive over 92 hours. A lot of them died and the ones [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=631.8s)]
*  who survived were killed. And that went on for 40 years. So we've been fighting that specific [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=636.68s)]
*  laboratory for the last nine years, Freedom of Information Act investigations, lawsuits against [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=641.0s)]
*  the NIH for records, grassroots campaigns. Over a million people wrote to Congress and the NIH asking [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=645.8s)]
*  for these tests to be cut, introducing legislation with members of Congress that targets this specific [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=652.12s)]
*  laboratory, writing letters to agencies, et cetera. And we were able to trick down the NIH [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=657.48s)]
*  laboratories to this very last lab. And Congress was told a month ago that not only was there still [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=663.56s)]
*  one active protocol, but they were actually intending on reviewing it and possibly approving [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=670.6s)]
*  it. So we were disappointed that this project was still going on under the Trump administration [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=675.16s)]
*  because President Trump, to his credit, and he doesn't certainly get enough credit for this, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=681.88s)]
*  and a lot of people don't know this, is that I would argue that the first Trump administration [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=686.44s)]
*  made more progress to end animal testing than any other administration in history. If you look at [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=691.72s)]
*  USDA, we exposed the largest cat lab there, Trump shut it down. They shut down dog and cat testing [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=696.36s)]
*  at the VA. They shut down nicotine tests on primates at the FDA and sent all of the primates [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=701.4000000000001s)]
*  to a sanctuary in Florida. They retired cats from the USDA, some of them who live with our president [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=706.36s)]
*  now. So there was a lot of great progress. So we were disappointed. And then Elon Musk, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=712.36s)]
*  Laura Loomer, and other folks started to jump in and say, Trump, why is this still going on? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=716.76s)]
*  You've been in office 100 days now. You got to clean up your own house before we start going [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=722.76s)]
*  after these other labs. And lo and behold, Sunday, Jay Bhattacharya went on Fox and Friends and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=727.8000000000001s)]
*  announced that they were shutting down this laboratory. Yeah, that's what I mean. I mean, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=732.6s)]
*  victories like that, after 90 days of the new administration and office, people often get excited [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=736.44s)]
*  with the new administration and the potential for it. But this victory was so complete, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=741.48s)]
*  so decisive. It was Jay Bhattacharya sent out to announce it, the head of the NIH. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=745.16s)]
*  I want to ask you a little bit more about the effects of all of this because I think one of the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=751.08s)]
*  reasons why I became so interested in the suffering and tell-tale and dog experiments was I was doing [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=757.72s)]
*  a lot of reporting on the indescribable evils, the moral evils and the spiritual rot that takes place [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=762.12s)]
*  in, I don't even like to call them farms, these industrialized warehouses where animals are kept [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=770.36s)]
*  and tortured and processed over the years. And I say that because I think farming life for all of [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=775.24s)]
*  its potential criticism, including that you kill an animal at the end to turn it into food, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=782.52s)]
*  this is a big tradition, but they treat their animals well. They keep them outside in natural [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=787.4s)]
*  habitats. They feed them. They treat them well until it's time to go to the slaughterhouse. And [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=791.88s)]
*  that's the exact opposite of factory farms. And I remember just kind of getting into this vista [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=796.12s)]
*  into animal experimentation when I did some reporting on these programs that are for beagles. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=802.28s)]
*  And I think it's important for people to know when they experiment on beagles, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=808.12s)]
*  they're not buying them. Maybe sometimes they buy them, but oftentimes they're not buying them. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=811.5600000000001s)]
*  They're not finding them on the street. They're not getting them from rescue shelters. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=816.04s)]
*  A lot of these programs entail the government breeding beagles. So they're born in these labs [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=819.64s)]
*  their only reason for creating this life and bringing them into existence is to immediately [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=826.2s)]
*  subject them to some of the most horrific experimentation that personally I have trouble [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=832.44s)]
*  even when I'm reporting on it, reading about and we're seeing about it or hearing about it. That's [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=838.2s)]
*  how sickening it is. And I think one of the things that we've learned about industrialized [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=842.2s)]
*  animal farms is that a lot of the people who work there end up being psychologically traumatized [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=849.0s)]
*  because you have to see this cruelty and inflict this cruelty every day. And you know, you watch a [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=855.48s)]
*  video where some dog gets kicked by somebody gratuitously and if it goes on the internet, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=861.16s)]
*  it viralizes and everybody's so enraged. How can you be, you know, how can anyone do that? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=865.16s)]
*  And yet these people are doing that every day. Do you think there's, and sometimes I really do [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=870.28s)]
*  wonder like, hey, how is it that these people get themselves to do that? Like what do they do to [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  justify it in their head? So I think there's often an assumption that, well, there must be some [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=881.16s)]
*  medical value, medical necessity where they can tell themselves, yeah, we wish we didn't have to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=886.36s)]
*  do this, but at the end of the day, we ought to be prioritizing humans. And these kinds of [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=892.36s)]
*  horrific experiments as torturous as they are, are what ends up saving lives. In other words, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=896.8399999999999s)]
*  there's a medical necessity to them. Is that true? No, absolutely not. And you have these agencies [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=902.92s)]
*  that are the top funders of animal experimentation like the NIH, which is again, the single largest [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=909.32s)]
*  funder of animal experimentation in the world, constantly lamenting the fact. And finally, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=914.04s)]
*  we have someone in the Trump administration, like Jay Bhattacharya, acknowledging this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=918.2s)]
*  publicly and very broadly that animal experimentation is incredibly wasteful. There's [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=922.6800000000001s)]
*  a horrible return on investment for taxpayers and obviously an incredible amount of suffering for [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=926.6800000000001s)]
*  animals for nothing, for no reason. The only people who benefit from animal experimentation, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  the ones lying in their pockets and personally conducting it and making it's big business. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=936.04s)]
*  Colleges and universities are raking in billions of dollars. College professors have built careers, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  torturing dogs and other animals. And then you look at all the other kind of ancillary businesses [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=945.16s)]
*  that you're speaking about, like the puppy mills. There are puppy mills across this country that [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=949.88s)]
*  are subsidized with tax dollars specifically to breed beagles to be tortured and killed in [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=955.0s)]
*  experiments. Not only that, there's small scale puppy mills at colleges and universities across [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=960.36s)]
*  the country where they intentionally breed beagles, Scotty dogs, Irish setters, other animals [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=965.96s)]
*  to suffer from deadly diseases from birth, to be physically deformed, to be blind, to suffer from [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=972.2800000000001s)]
*  hemophilia where most of the babies are bleeding out because they get a small injury that can't [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=979.48s)]
*  heal. This is all stuff that's being funded with taxpayer dollars. So it's a big business and people [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=984.2s)]
*  become invested in that from earlier in their career. And there's no incentive to innovate [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=988.9200000000001s)]
*  because the second you solve a problem, your grant gets cut off. So what do you do? You just [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=994.2800000000001s)]
*  keep tinkering away forever and ever at the expense of taxpayers, the expense of animals. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=998.0400000000001s)]
*  You get your name on a plaque at the Uricology University, you get promoted, you publish papers [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1003.32s)]
*  and you're heralded as a hero. There's a guy at the USDA who ran the largest cat lab, the one we [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1007.6400000000001s)]
*  exposed, they were flying to the wet markets in China, buying dog and cat meat, flying it back to [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1014.0400000000001s)]
*  the USDA, breeding kittens and then force feeding the kittens this cat meat in cannibalism [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1019.72s)]
*  experiments. They were doing this for decades. It cost $22 million. They killed thousands and [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1026.04s)]
*  thousands of kittens that they were breeding there. They put this guy in the USDA Hall of Fame. So [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1030.52s)]
*  there's incredibly perverse incentives for this community and biomedical research to torture [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  animals because you're heralded for it, you're rewarded for it, you're given a raise, you're [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1041.24s)]
*  promoted for it. And that's why the best solution, if you're talking about shutting down the labs, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1044.84s)]
*  putting animal experimenters out of a job, shutting down these puppy mills, is cutting the money [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1050.12s)]
*  because they're all subsidized by taxpayers and they couldn't possibly exist. And whether you're [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1054.84s)]
*  center right or left on the political spectrum, this is just the practical reality of this business, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1059.24s)]
*  of this 20 billion plus dollar a year business, is that it's propped up by taxpayers and if you [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1065.0s)]
*  remove those subsidies, it's going to collapse. You know, when I first started looking at the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1070.36s)]
*  question, because I was very open-minded when I started thinking about animal experimentation, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1076.28s)]
*  I think there's always been an assumption that there must be some value to it. Even those very [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1080.4399999999998s)]
*  controversial ones where rabbits were blinded by cosmetics or perfumes, as horrific as that seemed [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1085.6399999999999s)]
*  subject an animal to that level of suffering, people thought, well, it's what keeps, you know, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1094.5200000000002s)]
*  makeup or shampoo or perfume safe and therefore, you know, we want to prioritize humans. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1101.64s)]
*  And I assume there was some component to that at least with some of these things. And the more I [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1108.7600000000002s)]
*  look at it, you know what reminded me a lot of in academia, everybody in every school around the [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1112.1200000000001s)]
*  country and in the world is pressured and required to publish some sort of whatever [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1118.04s)]
*  in a journal in order to get an academic job. The problem is it's not easy to find things that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  haven't already been written about in a thousand times. That's just what academics are constantly [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1128.28s)]
*  doing. And so you can find these papers that are basically the same as things that have been [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1132.44s)]
*  written previously, only they'll very slightly change the date or the place where they're going [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1137.96s)]
*  in a way that adds nothing of value, but at least they can say that it's new and therefore get [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1144.36s)]
*  published. When the COVID pandemic happened, and as we know, we had all these epidemiologists [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1148.36s)]
*  telling Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci, look, this seems a lot like it was manipulated by [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1155.0s)]
*  scientists that it probably leaked from the Wuhan lab. And within a week, he had every single one [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1161.7199999999998s)]
*  of them signing onto a Lancet letter saying, we know for sure it came from an animal to human [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1167.3999999999999s)]
*  leap and not because, and that is basically racist misinformation to suggest it came from [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1174.12s)]
*  the Wuhan lab. I remember wondering like, how, why would these established leading scientists be [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1178.84s)]
*  willing to jump on board with that? And of course the answer is because between Francis Collins and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1185.08s)]
*  Anthony Fauci, they basically control all government, all funding. If you want to be in a research lab, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1189.7199999999998s)]
*  if you want to do medical research, those are the only ones who can basically fund it. And then the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1195.08s)]
*  more I looked at this question of medical necessity, I was finding exactly what you were [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1199.48s)]
*  describing. They would like take dogs at three months and subject them to some horrific disease [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1203.56s)]
*  for a year. And then the next time they would take dogs at five months and like subject it to them, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1209.64s)]
*  subject them to the disease for 10 months. And they would keep getting grants every time they [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  just tinkered with it and modified it slightly with no conceivable medical necessity to all [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1220.84s)]
*  these other studies. Is that like, what is in the culture that permits that sort of thing to keep [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1226.68s)]
*  happening? Well, I think people like Anthony Fauci are part of the problem. There is a culture of [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1232.52s)]
*  waste, fraud, and abuse and corruption at the NIH. The Wuhan lab is a great example of that. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1239.72s)]
*  We were the first group to expose Fauci's funding for the Wuhan lab in April, 2020. To your point, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1244.92s)]
*  we were called racist conspiracy theorists and loonies. And then fast forward now, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1249.4s)]
*  lots of Joe Biden's intelligence agencies now believe that the lab leak caused COVID. And those, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1254.44s)]
*  let's just remember those experiments going on in Wuhan. And this is the reason why we got involved [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1259.96s)]
*  in investigating it, were animal experiments. They were going into the wild, capturing bats [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1264.68s)]
*  very far away, thousands of miles away from Wuhan, bringing them back to the laboratory, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1269.96s)]
*  harvesting viruses from them, and then injecting those viruses into humanized mice who were [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1274.12s)]
*  genetically engineered mice and supercharging those naturally occurring coronaviruses to be [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1282.68s)]
*  extra dangerous to humans intentionally and extra transmissible to humans intentionally. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1289.72s)]
*  There is literally no medical necessity or justification for that. That is bio weapons [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1295.16s)]
*  development. There would be absolutely no other reason to take a naturally occurring virus and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1300.6000000000001s)]
*  soup it up in a laboratory and animal experiments to make it more deadly to people. The chances of [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1305.0s)]
*  the same virus actually breaking out in nature that you created in a laboratory, the chances are [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1311.16s)]
*  astronomically small that you would create the same virus that nature is going to create. So [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1316.68s)]
*  instead, you end up with a human-made virus that could leak out and kill millions of people. And [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1321.08s)]
*  that's exactly what happened. Again, no medical necessity, no medical benefit, but you have [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1325.8s)]
*  lunatics running this agency who think that's actually a good use of our money. And that's why [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1330.68s)]
*  it's great that people like Fauci and Francis Collins are gone. However, Fauci has been gone [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1335.88s)]
*  since December 2022. His legacy is still alive and well at the NIH. One of his deputies just [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1341.72s)]
*  got appointed to be the new head of his division, a gain of function lunatic who at once ordered [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1348.0400000000002s)]
*  somebody to dig up a dead body to get the 1918 flu from them, from this corpse to then supercharge [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1353.0s)]
*  in a gain of function experiment. This guy just got appointed the head of Fauci's old division. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1358.7600000000002s)]
*  And we have lots of experiments that Fauci funded that have been renewed since Trump came into [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1363.1599999999999s)]
*  office. So we are thrilled that we wiped out the last dog lab inside the NIH, but there is a lot [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1367.8s)]
*  of waste, fraud, and abuse to clean up across this country that Fauci personally signed off on, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1373.6399999999999s)]
*  put into motion, both the United States and abroad, but there's no oversight of what's happening. So [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1379.32s)]
*  that's why we've been big fans of the slash and burn approach at the NIH. The White House just [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1383.56s)]
*  proposed a 40% budget cut for them, which is absolutely warranted after what happened in Wuhan [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1390.44s)]
*  and the coverup that the government orchestrated. And then of course, there was the government [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1395.56s)]
*  orchestrated the coverup that you helped expose of Fauci's Beagle tests, where we had a long list [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1399.96s)]
*  of receipts, like a CVS receipt, you know, from floor to ceiling, showing all of this evidence [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1405.0s)]
*  that Fauci had funded these sand fly experiments on Beagles in Tunisia. And the Washington Post was [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1410.04s)]
*  fed misinformation by the NIH saying it was fake news. They ran a cover story saying fake Beagle [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1417.4s)]
*  research claims when there was evidence the whole time that it was absolutely true, and they only [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1422.76s)]
*  may have culpably last year. So, you know, you have these liars and losers and lunatics running the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1427.72s)]
*  government who have no concern for public health, don't care at all about animals, only care about [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1433.16s)]
*  their careers and progressing, keeping their jobs and amassing power. And that's how you end up with [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1438.1200000000001s)]
*  a situation like this. So good riddance to Fauci, good riddance to Collins, and we're, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1443.24s)]
*  you know, we're cautiously optimistic that Jay Bhattacharya is going to do more good at the NIH. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1447.4s)]
*  All right, come closer. I want to be very honest with you. It's kind of like a moment of candor [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1455.96s)]
*  here. I'm not somebody who loves going to the doctor. I know it's important, like the annual [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1460.04s)]
*  checkups and the lab and the blood work, but I really, in my mind, there's a huge part of my mind, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1465.16s)]
*  I was like, no, don't go. It's better to avoid it. I think we kind of all have that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1470.04s)]
*  Still, I do get peace of mind. I do, and I do understand why they matter. Like, you get kind [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1474.2s)]
*  of assurances. You can catch things early that are treatable, whereas if you wait, they become much [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1479.56s)]
*  more dangerous. And even just making sure you're staying ahead of health stuff that runs in your [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1484.76s)]
*  family or that can be preventative. So there's obviously a lot of good reasons to go, but a lot [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1490.76s)]
*  of people do get nervous about labs and blood work results. And again, I totally understand why, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1494.52s)]
*  but there's lots of things that you can do to work on your own health. And one simple lifestyle [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1502.2s)]
*  upgrade that we can all make is with a company that has been, I think, our earliest sponsor, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1506.76s)]
*  one of the two or three earliest sponsors going back to when we launched the show. We have a great [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1513.08s)]
*  relationship with them. We've gotten to know the product. I really appreciate it. It's Field of [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1516.84s)]
*  Greens, which is a delicious, actually, doctor formulated fruit and vegetable blend that you can [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1520.68s)]
*  just drink every day. People have a hard time preparing meals that are healthy, especially when [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1527.5600000000002s)]
*  this rush pressured life. These are blends of fruit and vegetables that are designed to just [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1532.92s)]
*  give your body the nutrients that you need if you don't have time to prepare it or even eat it. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1538.52s)]
*  It's so easy. You're going to feel amazing. Plus your doctor will notice your improved health or [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1542.52s)]
*  you get your money back. One Field of Greens customer wrote, quote, the best blood work I've [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1546.52s)]
*  had in a decade. My doctor said, quote, whatever you're doing, keep another, keep up, keep doing it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1551.8799999999999s)]
*  Another said, quote, for the first time in a year, my cholesterol numbers are normal. And a mom shared, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1557.4s)]
*  quote, after Field of Greens, my hair, nails, energy, and blood work are all better. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1562.28s)]
*  What an interesting order she put that in. Her hair, her nails, her energy, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1568.12s)]
*  and her blood work are all better. How can a fruit and vegetable drink promise better health? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1572.68s)]
*  Because each fruit and vegetable in Field of Greens is doctor selected to support vital organs [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1577.48s)]
*  like your heart, your liver, your kidneys, your metabolism, immune system. It's not just randomly [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LjAAW8C4k&t=1582.44s)]
