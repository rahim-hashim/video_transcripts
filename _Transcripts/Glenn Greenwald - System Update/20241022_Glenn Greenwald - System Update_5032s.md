# Glenn Exposes Free Speech and Pro-Democracy Frauds
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I)
*  Even those Harvard students we had on the show who were put on that no-file [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=0.0s)]
*  higher list, blacklist, and had trucks driving around Harvard, signed a letter [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=16.0s)]
*  essentially saying the reason for the October 7th attack was the Israeli [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  occupation and brutal treatment of the Palestinians, but they didn't praise [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=25.8s)]
*  Hamas or call for the murder of Jews either. Almost nobody who lost their job [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=29.32s)]
*  in these high-profile cases did anything remotely like that. Now again this sort [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=34.68s)]
*  of thing is exactly what has been condemned by people on the right for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=41.4s)]
*  years. Here is as just one of many examples a tweet by Christopher Ruffo [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=44.88s)]
*  who I think is one of the most influential right-wing activists in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=49.72s)]
*  December 20th, 2021 quote outrageous this brave teacher stood against critical [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=53.16s)]
*  race theory indoctrination in a school district and they fired him for it. And [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=58.76s)]
*  then here you see the quote from the teacher Tony Kennett, Indianapolis Public [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=62.72s)]
*  Schools just fired me for quote sharing that IPS recorded children and required [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=67.88s)]
*  racial justice sessions, not sending IPS the personnel info, quoting Dr. Payne's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=72.64s)]
*  racist comments to students, sharing public files. So the idea was nobody was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=78.32s)]
*  saying there oh school districts have the right to fire whoever they want [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=83.8s)]
*  including teachers who express views on controversial issues. No the idea was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=86.28s)]
*  this is outrageous. Here for the New York Post June 4th 2020, NBA voice Grant [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=89.64s)]
*  Nappier was unjustly fired over quote all lives matter truth. Grant Nappier 32 [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=97.08s)]
*  years the TV voice of the Sacramento Kings is a goner this week fired from his [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=103.44s)]
*  gig as a Sacramento sports talk host as the TV voice of the Kings TV broadcast [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=108.2s)]
*  because he's a racist perhaps there's no evidence like Hillary Clinton and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=113.84s)]
*  presumably millions before him Nappier was naive to the new presumption that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=118.36s)]
*  quote all lives matter is now considered by some to be a racist response to the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  black lives matter movement. But of course millions of Americans do consider [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=126.36s)]
*  and did consider all lives matter as a response to the black lives matter [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=131.92s)]
*  movement to be racist by denying that there's a particular need for black [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=136.16s)]
*  Americans to have attention call to the violence directed at them and there was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  no idea from the right oh well people are entitled to fire him if they want [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  for a phrase that many people now consider racist no it was outrageous it [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  was indicative of the repression we face and again I largely agreed with the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=153.08s)]
*  people critiquing that it's as I didn't change my mind on October 7th when it [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=158.96s)]
*  came to Israel. Here from the Daily Wire February 12 2021 Ben Shapiro says do you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  know Carano firing part of a movement to quote expel half of America? Daily [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=169.92s)]
*  Wire editor emeritus Ben Shapiro ripped the mass media company Disney and the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=176.32s)]
*  quote hard left on Thursday after actress Gina Carano was fired from her [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=181.32s)]

*  realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers can easily round up [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=214.2s)]
*  thousands of Jews the government first made their own neighbors hate them [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=217.76s)]
*  simply for being Jews how is that any different from hating someone for their [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=220.72s)]

*  pro-israel protests to continue meaning you're allowed to go out on the street [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=611.6800000000001s)]

*  the authorization from Congress required by the Constitution is the branch of [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2245.78s)]

*  CNN and whining and complaining or posting grievances on Twitter they could [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2264.14s)]

*  that decision on his own while they sit back and complain and chirp oh they [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2298.7s)]

*  our government that Congress has basically abdicated its responsibilities [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2308.46s)]
*  and its powers to the president but basically what we have now is exactly [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2311.86s)]
*  what the founders were desperate to avoid a standing military so we have a [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2317.02s)]
*  permanent military not one that is convened and assembled through conscript [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2322.82s)]
*  and voluntary fighting in the event of a war that Congress authorizes and funds [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2328.1400000000003s)]
*  and then the president executes that was division we have a permanent army [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2334.1s)]
*  obviously it's not going anywhere there's an army automatically and every [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2338.1s)]

*  infinitely more than any other country on the planet spends and then not only [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2345.22s)]
*  do we have that that this permanent military under the president's command [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2350.1s)]

*  almost with no input or checks from any other branch the exact kind of [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=2358.1s)]

*  that Kamala Harris is unique and at least modern American history in the [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3258.52s)]
*  lack of small d democratic legitimacy that she has acquired given her having [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3264.4s)]

*  the delegates are going to be this still the delegates have to do the nominating [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3310.6400000000003s)]

*  of consensus around this and so it's why you're not going to see a lot of [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3329.6s)]
*  complain this is somehow anti small-d Democratic okay so let's just let's just [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3332.6s)]
*  narrow it to the presidential level you're right there are previous instances [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3337.68s)]

*  collective mythology and consciousness and just in the modern era Kamala Harris [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3354.8399999999997s)]
*  has drastically less democratic legitimacy in terms of the metric that we [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3360.2799999999997s)]

*  I mean why can't that just be acknowledged I mean keep in mind you [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3390.64s)]
*  know modern presidential primary starting 72 so 68 even if you go back to 68 well [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3396.16s)]
*  not entirely but there were beauty contest primary there's a smattering of [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3404.16s)]
*  primaries right I thought on historical diatribes on this show people probably [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3408.44s)]
*  tune me out but even 1968 Hubert Humphrey had to go around and advocate [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3413.3199999999997s)]
*  he did not do a lot of primary well he didn't do a lot but he did some he did more than [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3418.8s)]
*  Harris has done like he had to go I pulled up where archives of like for the [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3421.96s)]
*  Vermont Democratic State Convention in 1968 where he had to go and send [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3425.5600000000004s)]
*  Sergius to campaign for his preferred slate of delegates and then they won in [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3429.5600000000004s)]
*  Vermont that's just one example it's a minor it's a minor point the grand scheme [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3433.88s)]
*  but he had to do more than Harris did but if you want to just let's just put [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3436.92s)]
*  it at the 70s okay yeah the set the dog the advent of the modern primary era [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3441.0s)]
*  came in the 70s so let's just use that as a cutoff would you acknowledge that [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3444.32s)]
*  Harris has the least democratic legitimacy small d of the modern primary [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3448.4s)]
*  era of either party major nominees I would not put in terms of legitimacy so [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3452.92s)]
*  there were delegates elected through the primary process the delegates hold the [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3458.2000000000003s)]
*  power if some other candidate wanted to raise their hand and say I'm gonna run [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3463.12s)]
*  against Harris they're allowed to do so they did it and they and they were [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3467.76s)]
*  calling it the presumptive nominee now because journalists called all the [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3473.0s)]
*  delegates to say do you support Harris and a majority said yes and so that's [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3477.5s)]
*  why the media said he's just a presumptive nominee which is what they [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3481.78s)]
*  always do just typically it's through in the middle of these electoral contests [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3483.78s)]
*  there are ways to stop Harris if Democrats wanted her to be stopped they [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3487.58s)]
*  don't and that's why this is going to be a legitimate process even though it's [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3492.74s)]
*  not going through the traditional primary process as we know it since 1972 [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3497.18s)]
*  but there's no way for voters to signal their preference for another candidate [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3501.9s)]
*  the primaries were over when the Democrats decided to pull this switcheroo [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3507.18s)]
*  yes you're right the primary voters and caucus goers elected delegates who were [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3512.3799999999997s)]
*  pledged to Joe Biden not to Kamala Harris and this talking point that in [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3518.94s)]
*  electing Joe Biden the Democratic primary voters were also like de facto [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3523.7s)]
*  electing Kamala Harris that's just not true there's no vice presidential primary [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3528.3399999999997s)]
*  there's a presidential primary Joe Biden would have theoretically been more than [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3531.98s)]
*  entitled to select a different vice presidential nominee if he had wanted to [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3536.14s)]
*  now in practice he almost certainly would not have but that would have been [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3539.14s)]
*  up to him so I mean when I say democratic legitimacy I'm in terms of [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3542.62s)]
*  I'm talking in terms of electoral input by the masses you know which is what the [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3547.3799999999997s)]
*  modern primary system was supposed to enable right this was not I'm not [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3553.7799999999997s)]
*  arguing that voters when they cast their ballots in the primaries did so knowing [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3558.9s)]
*  I know if Biden drops out in July it's gonna be Harris that was in top of mind [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3565.42s)]
*  when the votes occurred at the time what I'm saying is delegates are elected [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3569.34s)]
*  through those processes the process literally sends delegates to the [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3574.34s)]
*  convention the party rules allow those delegates to make different choices on [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3578.1s)]
*  the convention floor and those delegates have chosen to back Harris and because [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3584.54s)]
*  you know even though there's no voting process that's been that's created [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3591.7s)]
*  post-primary politicians can read the rule we do have polls we do have [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3597.3799999999997s)]
*  anecdotal data if there was a market for an alternative candidate a politician [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3602.9399999999996s)]
*  would step into that vacuum and try to serve that market but every bit of data [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3609.7s)]
*  that we have is that that market doesn't exist so you're not you're not finding [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3614.18s)]
*  Democrats saying I'm mad about this this is illegitimate everyone's like let us [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3618.94s)]
*  go let us get this done so you're I just don't think there's gonna be a way for [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3622.66s)]
*  anyone to drive a wedge through the Democratic base to say you should be [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3628.54s)]
*  mad about this because the Democrats are not bad about this okay so let's go to [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3632.7400000000002s)]
*  the this July 8th letter you probably recall this that Joe Biden issued to [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3636.98s)]
*  congressional Democrats it was the same day that he turned in his defiant phone [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3642.34s)]
*  in call to mourning Joe he also sent a letter to congressional Democrats [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3647.38s)]
*  adamantly insisting that he was gonna stay in the race come hell or high water [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3651.58s)]
*  and he said the following this was a process open to anyone who wanted to run [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3656.02s)]
*  only three people chose to challenge me one fared so badly that he left the [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3661.82s)]
*  primaries to run as independent it's obviously a thinly veiled reference to [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3665.9s)]
*  RFK jr. another attacked me for being too old and was sounding defeated [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3669.38s)]
*  another veiled reference to Dean Phillips the voters of the Democratic [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3673.22s)]
*  Party have voted Biden says they have chosen me to be the nominee of the party [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3677.58s)]
*  then he asks do we now just say this process didn't matter that the voters [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3682.98s)]
*  don't have a say I declined to do that Biden's Biden says I feel a deep [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3688.22s)]
*  obligation to the faith and the trust of the voters of the Democratic Party that [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3694.3799999999997s)]
*  they have placed in me to run this year it was their decision to make not the [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3698.4199999999996s)]
*  press not the pundits not the big donors not any selected group of [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3701.3s)]
*  individuals no matter how well intentioned the voters and the voters [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3705.6600000000003s)]
*  alone decide the nominee of the Democratic Party and here's the kicker [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3709.2200000000003s)]
*  bill and I want your answer to this one here I want you to answer Joe Biden's [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3713.1000000000004s)]
*  question not my question answer Joe Biden's question he asks how can we [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3717.78s)]
*  stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party I cannot do [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3722.78s)]
*  that I will not do that so Bill that was July 8th what's the answer today [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3727.82s)]
*  they're negating the entire process he did not have a strong argument which is [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3737.06s)]
*  why he quit people were it was very evident that he was unlikely to win and [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3743.7400000000002s)]
*  I believe I know I realize that Biden has not copped to this publicly there [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3753.14s)]
*  appears to be a health problem there I would prefer transparency in that regard [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3758.8999999999996s)]
*  where that we're not getting I will concede that but everyone was pretty [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3764.3399999999997s)]
*  clear most I mean I just showed everyone there's that there's obviously were [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3770.46s)]
*  Biden diehard so I'm quite aware of them on X I clearly Biden has inner circle I [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3773.3799999999997s)]
*  think Biden was slow to get to the place where he got I think that I think when [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3777.8599999999997s)]
*  he wrote that letter I think that was probably written very sincerely in the [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3781.3799999999997s)]
*  moment but a whole lot of people recognized that he was not up to this [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3784.02s)]
*  task and then what reporting we have it appears that once the internal polling [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3789.58s)]
*  was shown to Biden by people close to him he had to accept that and so once he [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3796.22s)]
*  decides he is no longer running anymore all those July 8th arguments are [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3802.3799999999997s)]
*  completely moot and obsolete he is literally just not the nominee anymore [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3807.18s)]
*  he's not a candidate for the office anymore and that frees up the delegates [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3811.7s)]
*  who were elected to choose who they want to choose and the majority of them and [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3816.06s)]
*  would appear to be unanimously one Kamala Harris right but the argument [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3820.9s)]
*  here is that not just that the polls are showing me potentially losing to Trump [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3828.18s)]
*  the argument here was that if the donors and the press and all the know-it-alls [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3834.2999999999997s)]
*  try to coerce me out of the race what they'll be doing is invalidating the [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3838.7799999999997s)]
*  Democratic will of the Democratic Party's voters and that'll undermine we [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3843.5s)]
*  Democrats in our ability to make the case against Trump and the Republicans [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3849.42s)]
*  that we quote stand for democracy because it'll show that we're quote [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3853.54s)]
*  ignoring it in our own party so I don't understand how that same argument [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3857.3399999999997s)]
*  couldn't be made today because the exact thing that Biden was warning about has [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3862.7799999999997s)]
*  come to pass whatever his poll results showed the Democratic Party [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3867.18s)]
*  apparently in its upper echelons decided that it would be in their best interest [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3871.4199999999996s)]
*  to negate the results of the primaries so I don't see what is flawed about [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3874.74s)]
*  Biden's argument here in the sense that by negating those primary results you're [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3880.58s)]
*  showing that the Democratic Party clearly doesn't have that same [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3887.54s)]
*  commitment to democracy that it likes to pontificate about am I missing something? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3890.08s)]
*  It would be a valid argument if he was standing for election [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3895.6s)]
*  So it was valid on July 8th? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3900.4s)]
*  If he was standing for election at the Democratic convention and the delegates [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3901.4s)]
*  who were elected to vote for him turned on him and elected somebody else whilst [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3907.92s)]
*  looking at Biden in the face that argument would hold water that would be [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3913.12s)]
*  delegates not doing what they were elected to do however Biden withdrew [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3918.0s)]
*  that changes everything about that argument and if Trump or anybody else [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3922.68s)]
*  wants to prosecute this case to say Kamala Harris is an illegitimate [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3929.28s)]
*  candidate because she did not go through a traditional primary process every bit [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3935.6s)]
*  of poll data that we have suggests that that argument is gonna fall extremely [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3939.64s)]
*  flat almost every American regardless of party wanted Biden to not be in this race [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3944.28s)]
*  and as on the Democratic side is concerned there is a massive amount of excitement that they have [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3951.6400000000003s)]
*  another alternative instead of Joe Biden right now and I like I say this as someone who was a [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3957.28s)]
*  very big Joe Biden defender approached up until the debate so I'm not someone who's had a real [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3961.8s)]
*  animus towards Joe Biden I'm just telling you what everything we're seeing in the past week [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3966.48s)]
*  shows just a practically euphoric sense of excitement for what is happening here and so [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3972.04s)]
*  I think being a kind of a sour puss about the process just isn't gonna get anyone very far [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3978.92s)]
*  well I guess I'm inclined to be a sour puss about many things and maybe including the Democratic [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3983.56s)]
*  primary process of 2024 which I actually covered you know in fair depth I went to New Hampshire I [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3990.2s)]
*  went to Iowa I went to you know lots of places you know I was talking to people about the process [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=3995.68s)]
*  in New Hampshire you might recall Biden actually wasn't technically on the ballot and they had a [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4001.3999999999996s)]
*  write-in Biden campaign because what the DNC under Biden's effective control wanted to do was [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4008.16s)]
*  rejigger the primary process in 2024 to put a premium on South Carolina or put it first [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4014.7999999999997s)]
*  chronologically because that was where Biden's more natural support base was and basically what [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4022.4799999999996s)]
*  they did that was incredible was they tried to more or less disenfranchise New Hampshire despite [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4027.2s)]
*  its you know vaunted first in the nation primary status by saying look I mean the DNC sent a [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4033.6s)]
*  threat letter to this New Hampshire Democratic Party saying you have to instruct candidates in [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4038.48s)]
*  this primary con primary race that the outcome is gonna be meaningless they use that exact word [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4045.2799999999997s)]
*  meaningless and so I don't know I guess I just remember this stuff and just say it's all flushed [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4050.4s)]
*  down the memory hole with such abandon I don't know it just grows me the wrong way you're probably [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4057.04s)]
*  right that this euphoria that's overtaken a lots of Democratic elites and people in the media whatever [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4061.8s)]
*  probably is superior in their minds to like having any cognizance of the bizarre process that got it [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4067.2000000000003s)]
*  to this point but I still I can't shake my curiosity about it and you know maybe it's because [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4075.8s)]
*  oftentimes I feel like I'm in the wood in the weeds of a lot of these procedural issues so I'm [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4081.36s)]
*  unusually interested but I don't know I mean do you sympathize with me at all on that score well [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4086.28s)]
*  let me say let me say three things I'll try to say them quickly number one well I think one I [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4091.6800000000003s)]
*  think the euphoria we're talking about is not strictly elites I think in polls suggests this [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4098.56s)]
*  is broad-based I think the average American average American didn't think Joe Biden should [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4103.84s)]
*  be in the race average Democrat very excited about Kamala Harris it's not just Nancy Pelosi [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4108.32s)]
*  it's not just donors so that's number one number two I think the New Hampshire play by Biden was [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4113.28s)]
*  stupid I think the obsession with putting South Carolina first was stupid I've written about this [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4119.8s)]
*  in the past South Carolina had all the influence that you could possibly want batting cleanup [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4124.72s)]
*  is a great place to be it's better than being first it was very this is superficial notion that [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4131.08s)]
*  we shouldn't have a small white state go first we should have a probably African-American state [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4136.919999999999s)]
*  go first ignored the fact that the African-Americans number in the Democratic Party were picking the [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4140.599999999999s)]
*  nominee out of South Carolina every single time as it was the whole thing was done but the third [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4145.36s)]
*  thing I would say is Donald Trump when he was the incumbent very much Jerry rigged the 2020 [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4152.599999999999s)]
*  primary process to make that a non contest as well it's hardly unusual for an incumbent [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4156.72s)]
*  president to have his thumb on the scale of the party machinery and make that a very smooth [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4162.4800000000005s)]
*  process so I understand it being off-putting but hardly unprecedented and hardly unique to Democrats [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4166.4400000000005s)]
*  so Bill as a fellow white dude I'm curious for your thoughts on the Democratic Party seeming [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4171.2s)]
*  embrace of white identity politics we saw this big zoom call white dudes for Harris last night [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4180.12s)]
*  lots of big celebrities on the call lots of white dude Democrats in Congress and so forth you had [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4187.2s)]
*  who was the guy Sam wise from the Lord of the Rings movies he had Mark Hamill who recited his [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4197.84s)]
*  you know Luke Skywalker taglines and on and on and on and it seems like the Democratic Party is [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4205.12s)]
*  now going out and then this got a ton of coverage so did the white women for Kamala session so I've [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4211.8s)]
*  declared this particular edition of our show a white dudes only show inspired by the Democratic [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4218.8s)]
*  Party seeming recent turn toward white identity politics are you ungratified by this do you welcome [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4226.04s)]
*  being so personally catered to by the Democrats as a kill cohesive racialized interest group well [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4231.88s)]
*  first everybody does identity politics and they've been doing it since the beginning of politics we [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4240.4800000000005s)]
*  just saw Donald Trump go to turning points conference begging Christians to vote for him [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4246.36s)]
*  that's identity politics we've seen people stand behind Donald Trump with a blacks for Trump sign [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4250.68s)]
*  that's identity politics so nothing new here nothing surprising nothing shocking I think this [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4255.88s)]
*  is a little bit different this white dudes thing it's it's not you know it's not the official [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4262.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris campaign doing it this and it sprung up on its own it's got a lot of celebrities [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4269.88s)]
*  involved I know some elected Democrats but you had you had you had every vice presidential nominee [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4274.6s)]
*  who could get a potential vice presidential nominee who could get on the call Tim Walls [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4279.68s)]
*  JB Pritzker Roy Cooper yes they all fell over themselves to get on this so if even if it wasn't [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4283.92s)]
*  run by the official campaign apparatus it was the closest thing to it no no no one's disavowing it [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4289.92s)]
*  of course but this this is less about trying to tailor a message to a constituency as I think [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4296.52s)]
*  being it's a little bit tongue-in-cheek it's a little bit trying just to send a message to you [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4305.2s)]
*  average white person you don't need to be afraid annoyed off you know put off by not having someone [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4311.92s)]
*  who has your demographic at the top of the ticket and you I heard you talking about Obama with a [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4320.08s)]
*  mr. Ziegler before I mean Obama was a master at navigating those racial waters and trying to not [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4324.2s)]
*  seem scary to white voters and did it you know as good as anyone could possibly do it in 2008 this [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4332.96s)]
*  is sort of a different you know version of that but it's in the same vein it's just a way to say [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4342.0s)]
*  look this is not a candidate who's gonna cater to a narrow slice of America we're trying to do things [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4348.28s)]
*  to show she's gonna she's gonna appeal to a broad swath of America and that's just the way politics [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4355.72s)]
*  works and it has since the beginning of time okay so final topic Bill you've written for the Washington [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4360.68s)]
*  Monthly you called on Biden to withdraw on July 5th but you also called him to resign the presidency [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4366.8s)]
*  you called for him to resign the presidency and you follow this up by doing a long historical [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4372.92s)]
*  disquisition on Woodrow Wilson which I found interesting people should read that article if [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4379.280000000001s)]
*  they want to get some historical context on that Woodrow Wilson obviously was incapacitated [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4383.64s)]
*  effectively by a stroke as he was negotiating the potential entry of the United States into the [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4388.48s)]
*  League of Nations which never happened in part it's suspected because Wilson became erratic and [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4394.679999999999s)]
*  even lost some of his political acumen and therefore the Senate essentially rebelled against him and he [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4401.5199999999995s)]
*  could not get the treaty ratified that would have been required to admit the US to the League of [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4407.599999999999s)]
*  Nations and you're you likened to Biden's predicament to this obviously you can't make a [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4411.879999999999s)]
*  perfect parallel for virtually any historical scenario but you've been saying that Biden [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4417.72s)]
*  shouldn't just withdraw from the race he needs to resign the presidency and make Harris the [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4423.64s)]
*  president and now if we're taking Biden at his word he's saying he's gonna serve the next six [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4428.76s)]
*  months of his presidency he's not gonna resign he's not gonna heed your advice so number one [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4434.52s)]
*  isn't that a huge political liability for whoever the Democratic nominee is obviously it seems like [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4441.320000000001s)]
*  it's almost certainly gonna be Harris but even if it were somebody else I don't know Gavin Newsom [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4446.68s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer anybody they would have to be answering for the fact that the current Democratic [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4450.76s)]
*  incumbent president is somebody who had to withdraw from the race on the grounds of diminished mental [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4456.68s)]
*  acuity you know that became a consensus view within his own party and yet he's persisting on in the [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4462.84s)]
*  office of the presidency even in that diminished state to the point that you so diminished in fact [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4471.320000000001s)]
*  that it led to you calling for him to resign so isn't there a huge political liability there and [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4476.28s)]
*  what about it on a substantive level I mean shouldn't we just as Americans be a little [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4481.08s)]
*  bit worried about Biden's ability to for example I don't know there could be a war breaking out as [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4487.24s)]
*  we speak or at least an escalated war between Israel and Hezbollah in which the U.S. is going [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4492.92s)]
*  to inevitably have a very intimate and direct operational role you never know what could spiral [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4497.719999999999s)]
*  out of control with Russia and Ukraine Taiwan etc there any number of obviously hugely consequential [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4504.12s)]
*  scenarios that could unfold that the president has to be alert and capable to manage and we have [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4512.68s)]
*  somebody in office who is saying he's going to be there for the next six months it's a long time [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4519.8s)]
*  a lot could happen in six months so what's your response to that well I think you raised the two [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4524.599999999999s)]
*  relevant points what's the political risk and what's the substantive risk and I had concerns [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4531.56s)]
*  on both those counts when I wrote that in terms of the politics of it so far Democrats have [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4538.6s)]
*  navigated Biden staying in office you know without fault Biden hasn't copped to any kind of health [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4547.320000000001s)]
*  issue any kind of neurological problem Republicans were the ones that demanded he resigned Democrats [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4555.72s)]
*  shrugged it off and we aren't really talking about that all that much anymore so I think in the short [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4561.64s)]
*  run they've avoided the I mean I was concerned that Harris would be bombarded with questions how [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4568.92s)]
*  can you possibly stand there while we have a sitting president with an obvious health problem [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4577.08s)]
*  and you think that's okay she hasn't been hammered with that question and since no one has [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4583.88s)]
*  why hasn't she I'm not I'm not one to just flippantly line up with Republican grievances [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4591.08s)]
*  or conservative grievances about mainstream media but shouldn't that be a pretty obvious question [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4596.28s)]
*  like shouldn't Harris had to have wouldn't wouldn't you think that at least on like I don't know one or [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4600.92s)]
*  two occasions since being crowned presumptive nominee she would have to address that very [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4607.16s)]
*  straightforward question were you aware of Joe Biden's diminished cognitive faculties that had [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4612.2s)]
*  ever raised concerns for you but nobody's even mentioning it anymore because they're so overcome [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4618.2s)]
*  with this euphoria that seems a little odd to me I think she's going to get all those questions [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4622.84s)]
*  you know I don't think she's done I think when she has her first sit-down interview which I don't [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4629.96s)]
*  think she's had which is also bizarre which is also a bizarre sign of how seamlessly she's been [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4635.0s)]
*  able to circumvent any standard hurdle to getting this nomination like the one of the points of a [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4642.76s)]
*  protracted primary process is not only that you would have to compete for votes and delegates but [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4649.24s)]
*  you'd have debates you have to do interviews to scrutinize yourself before the public she's done [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4653.08s)]
*  none of that she is you're right I don't think she has done an interview since Biden withdrew [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4660.2s)]
*  from the race and why should she the media is beside itself with euphoria so she doesn't even [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4664.04s)]
*  have to do it right I mean they're giving her a pass well I wouldn't blame the media for that she [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4668.6s)]
*  was able to lock up that's official delegate support which gets her crown presumptive nominee [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4674.92s)]
*  by the media and okay why is the New York Times and CNN and the Washington Post and MSNBC and [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4681.0s)]
*  the Washington Monthly why aren't they clamoring for her to do a sit-down interview ASAP [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4687.96s)]
*  I mean I think this is going to happen I think it will happen probably very soon this is literally [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4695.56s)]
*  a week ago you know or not nine days ago so I think these things are going to happen I think [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4700.84s)]
*  she's going to get those questions and we'll see what the answers are I think there is a [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4705.56s)]
*  uh well let me let me let me shift to the substantive part of the of the question [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4712.28s)]
*  I think the Wilson history is instructive here I'm again we they're two different people their [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4717.32s)]
*  condition are condition are not necessarily the same of course probably not the same so I can't [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4722.919999999999s)]
*  know exactly what is going to happen to Biden physically and mentally over the next six months [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4727.5599999999995s)]
*  but we do see in the Wilson example people may know that he had a very big stroke uh in October [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4733.0s)]
*  1919 the seventh year of his presidency left him uh basically incapacitated he did recover somewhat [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4740.84s)]
*  but he never never copped with publicly fully uh never there's no entertainment of him resigning [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4747.8s)]
*  and he just you know you know powered through with the help of his wife doing a lot of the [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4753.32s)]
*  a lot of the heavy lifting uh but there were signs of problems in the months before that even in the [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4757.16s)]
*  years before that but he was having many strokes decades before you know but never really had his [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4765.0s)]
*  underlying neurological condition properly diagnosed and never didn't have his high blood [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4771.32s)]
*  pressure properly diagnosed so he wasn't being treated uh and so it was a very very slow moving [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4775.72s)]
*  uh progression of cerebrovascular disease and we had a point in April of 1919 when he's in he's [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4782.04s)]
*  in France he's literally negotiating the treaty he's not delegating it to a secretary of state [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4790.52s)]
*  he's doing it he's there for months it's a very stressful endeavor uh he gets a very high fever [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4794.12s)]
*  he has bouts of delirium delirium is different than dementia but if you have early signs of [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4800.76s)]
*  dementia it can exacerbate it he has a mini stroke after the fever uh and there are people that say [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4804.599999999999s)]
*  like Herbert Hoover who was in his administration that he wasn't the same person after that now it's [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4812.2s)]
*  not total night and day it's not like he didn't know up from down uh but he wasn't as sharp he [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4816.92s)]
*  wasn't speaking as well uh he had a harder time selling what was a controversial treaty when he [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4823.64s)]
*  came back to the states uh but he even but he wasn't so bad off that even his defenders didn't [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4829.320000000001s)]
*  want him to quit his defenders said we want you out there we want you to go on a speaking tour we [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4836.04s)]
*  want you to sell this treaty we want you to sell the league of nations and he booked an 8 000 mile [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4840.68s)]
*  29 city train tour even though his doctor in some of his inner circle said i don't know if you got [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4847.160000000001s)]
*  the strength for this right now but he felt he was the indispensable indispensable man [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4853.400000000001s)]
*  he does it some of the speeches were great some of the speeches were not so great uh and then [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4857.72s)]
*  eventually he pushed himself too hard he ends up having the full blown stroke so what uh where [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4863.240000000001s)]
*  this is potentially relevant is by i don't think by and is like so at the lunch he can't you know [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4869.96s)]
*  can't twiddle his thumbs can't do the basis of the job right now but we're seeing some signs of [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4875.96s)]
*  decline and i don't think there's been i got three and a half year cover up i think something [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4881.56s)]
*  happened more recently and i would very much like to have a a fresh medical assessment so we can [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4886.52s)]
*  find out what that was saying you got a test in february doesn't count so i think something [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4891.8s)]
*  happened since february but i'm not a doctor and i can't diagnose from afar we should have a fresh [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4895.96s)]
*  medical uh checkup in my opinion we haven't gotten that if you if you want to criticize that i would [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4900.200000000001s)]
*  agree with that criticism uh but for a substantive standpoint he's running a risk that something else [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4905.56s)]
*  might happen between now and january that would make him worse off than he is today today can he [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4912.04s)]
*  handle the base of the job yeah i think probably i can't know for sure but i think probably but it [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4918.280000000001s)]
*  may not stay that way and if something does happen that's very obvious to the eye that might end up [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4922.76s)]
*  being a bigger problem for harris politically maybe that would actually precipitate a resignation if [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4927.4800000000005s)]
*  it got really bad uh so uh it does leave me with a bit of concern uh but as a political matter as [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4932.12s)]
*  of today it hasn't proven to be a problem well i tend to suspect that this outburst of euphoria [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4939.4s)]
*  over much within much of the media over this coronation of kamala harris has [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4949.16s)]
*  suspiciously lessened the interest in joe biden's cognitive aptitude i haven't seen many [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4955.32s)]
*  thorough new york times or washington post investigations or political leaks on joe [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4962.2s)]
*  biden's ability to conduct his basic duties of office in the past uh 10 days or so maybe that'll [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4966.839999999999s)]
*  pick up again but um it seems like it's been set aside in favor of this cheerleading for for kamala [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4972.839999999999s)]
*  harris without like we've established her even sitting down for interview to answer some of these [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4981.0s)]
*  very fundamental questions uh but uh bill share we're gonna have to leave it there thank you for [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSYOTHzMd1I&t=4985.72s)]
