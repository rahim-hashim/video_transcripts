# Trump Demands Iran's UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo)
*  When the Israelis first attacked Iran, the Americans, including Donald Trump and Secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=0.0s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio, were very eager rhetorically to distance themselves from it, coming out [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=11.22s)]
*  that night and saying, this is a unilateral Israeli attack. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=16.46s)]
*  The United States is not involved. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=19.72s)]
*  Now there was a lot of skepticism, including from me, about whether that could possibly [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=22.36s)]
*  be true. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  It was unimaginable that the Israelis, given their full-scale dependence and reliance on [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=27.06s)]
*  the United States for military support, financial support, diplomatic support, would possibly [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=31.06s)]
*  launch a major war of this kind without not only advising Donald Trump in advance but [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=35.62s)]
*  getting his approval. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=40.7s)]
*  After all, Trump had been pretending to restrain the Israelis. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=41.7s)]
*  He publicly was telling them as late as that day that he doesn't want them to attack Iran [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=45.82s)]
*  because that would sabotage the diplomatic resolution that he still believed he could [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=50.94s)]
*  achieve. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=55.22s)]
*  But it was inconceivable that the Israelis would just go and defy Trump and launch a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=56.62s)]
*  war on their own. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=60.66s)]
*  And increasingly, every day, it's become clearer and clearer through reporting, particularly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=61.66s)]
*  through Donald Trump's own statements, that he not only knew about the war in advance, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=65.7s)]
*  that he not only greenlit the war in advance, but that he ordered his administration to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=70.46s)]
*  plan the war directly with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=75.94s)]
*  And especially once he began to see that the war was perceived as a success, Trump began [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=78.22s)]
*  getting more and more explicit, more and more blatant about his view that the credit for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=83.46s)]
*  this war goes first to him, that he's the one who's essentially the author of this war, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=88.54s)]
*  the father of it, the person who's now presiding over it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=93.66s)]
*  And over the past 24 hours, Trump's posture has dramatically transformed in a way that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=97.98s)]
*  I will confess I find genuinely alarming for reasons I'm about to show you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=103.86s)]
*  Donald Trump is not just talking any longer about America having participated in this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=108.06s)]
*  war or supporting the Israeli effort. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=112.86s)]
*  He's now talking about this war as though it is his, as though it is United States' [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  war that we started for no blends and that he intends to conclude through what he is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=120.46s)]
*  now calling unconditional surrender. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=127.46s)]
*  And he's no longer even pretending what they were trying to feign just a few days ago, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=130.74s)]
*  which is that the Israelis launched this war unilaterally. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=135.06s)]
*  Donald Trump is now saying this is our war, we're the ones who are dominating Iran, we're [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=137.22s)]
*  the ones who are beating Iran, and we won't even accept the ceasefire or negotiations [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=141.7s)]
*  of any kind, we want a complete end to this issue forever. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=145.74s)]
*  And he presented all of those views, all of those proclamations, not in a address to the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=150.54s)]
*  nation, though he does intend to give one, I'm not sure exactly when, but he did so instead [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=156.22s)]
*  in a series of tweets or whatever they call postings on True Social that he later then [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=161.78s)]
*  posted on X and we want to just show you several of them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=166.3s)]
*  This was late last night after we concluded our show yesterday evening where he said, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=170.06s)]
*  America first means many great things, including the fact that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=175.86s)]
*  make America great again. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=182.02s)]
*  So that's pretty standard course for him just supporting the Israeli war based on this utterly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=184.5s)]
*  unproven premise that Iran was seeking nuclear weapons, something we've been being told for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=189.42s)]
*  30 to 40 years only for it to always become disproven, and Trump now has just asserted, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=194.26s)]
*  even though his own Director of National Security Tulsi Gabbard told the Senate three months [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  ago that it wasn't true, that Iran suddenly decided that it was going to seek a nuclear [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=203.7s)]
*  weapon and was very close to getting one and that's why this word was justified. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=208.62s)]
*  He was asked on Air Force One last night by CNN's Caitlin Collins about Tulsi Gabbard's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=213.34s)]
*  statement to the Senate that the consensus of the intelligence community was that in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=220.7s)]
*  fact Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=225.42s)]
*  They had a nuclear energy program as they've had one for many years, but that the Ayatollah [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=228.14s)]
*  had not authorized nor decided that the Iranians should pursue a nuclear weapon, that their [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=233.1s)]
*  posture with regard to nuclear weapons hasn't changed at all, and she asked him, this is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=238.7s)]
*  not some random person inside the intelligence community, this is not some person who isn't [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  loyal to you, this is the person you fought to get confirmed into this position by arguing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  that Tulsi Gabbard would clean up the intelligence community to make it reliable enough for you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=252.9s)]
*  to depend upon when making decisions. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=257.42s)]
*  She's the one that you picked, and she said the consensus of the intelligence community [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=259.98s)]
*  and the intelligence itself, which she's reviewed, is that Iran was not in fact pursuing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=264.18s)]
*  nuclear weapons, and here's what he had to say when she asked him that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=269.94s)]
*  You don't believe Iran should be able to have a nuclear weapon, but how close do you personally [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=273.54s)]
*  think that they were to getting one? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=278.34s)]
*  Because Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said Iran wasn't [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=280.14s)]
*  building a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=285.94s)]
*  I don't care what she said, I think they were very close to having one. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=287.14s)]
*  I got us one on you and... [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=289.94s)]
*  It was a little low, so let's just play this over. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=290.94s)]
*  So here's Caitlin Collins asking him about Tulsi Gabbard's statement. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=293.94s)]
*  Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=296.74s)]
*  I don't care what she said, I think they were very close to having one. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=298.74s)]
*  So he says, I don't care what she said. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=302.54s)]
*  It's kind of a humiliating statement to make about the director of national intelligence [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=304.74s)]
*  that you chose. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=310.74s)]
*  I don't care what she says. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=312.54s)]
*  The whole reason she's there is to provide you with the intelligence. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=315.14000000000004s)]
*  But obviously Trump is deeply vested in the idea that this is a noble war that he helped [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  launch, that he has now ordered US military assets to fight in. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=324.14000000000004s)]
*  They're already US military assets active in that region, intercepting ballistic missiles [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=328.34s)]
*  sent from Iran, both in the skies and other ways. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=335.14s)]
*  And they're certainly active in providing intelligence and in planning the war. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=339.34s)]
*  And now we're getting closer and closer to the moment where Trump is making very clear [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=343.94s)]
*  that he's now going to start giving the Israelis everything that they demanded, as American [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=347.34s)]
*  presidents typically do, in this case meaning the B-2 bombers that are uniquely large enough [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  to carry the bunker busters that are needed to destroy Iran's premier enrichment facilities [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=357.74s)]
*  that are buried very deep underground. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=364.74s)]
*  The Israelis can't do that on their own. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=366.54s)]
*  And here was what Trump said this morning that I found to be the most significant, at [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=369.54s)]
*  least at that point, of his pronouncement. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  He said this, quote, we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=375.74s)]
*  And obviously to me at least, the key word there is we. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=382.34000000000003s)]
*  We now have complete and total control over the skies over Iran. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=385.54s)]
*  Now unless Trump identifies as an Israeli or believes that Israel is a state in the United [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  States, something that a lot of people do believe, they don't usually say that, but [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  they do think that way, then we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=399.14000000000004s)]
*  It must mean that in Trump's mind, it's the United States military that's responsible [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=404.94s)]
*  for this war, that's fighting this war, that this is now an American war. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=408.94s)]
*  He went on to say Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment and plenty of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=412.54s)]
*  it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived and manufactured, quote, stuff. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=421.14000000000004s)]
*  Nobody does it better than the good old USA. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=426.14000000000004s)]
*  So Israel's barely even mentioned in this framework any longer in Trump's mind. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=430.54s)]
*  This is a war between the United States and Iran. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  He's giving credit to the Iranians for saying you have a lot of good sky trackers and air [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=436.94s)]
*  defense systems, but we don't care because it's no match for our technology. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=442.94s)]
*  He's not even mentioning Israel anymore. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=446.94s)]
*  It's just absorbed into Donald Trump's mind that this is his war, the war that he planned, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  that he plotted, and to the extent that he perceives this to be a success, which he clearly [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  does, he wants full credit for it, not even supporting a partial credit for it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=458.14s)]
*  Here's Trump issuing another tweet or whatever, another truth on Truth Social. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=463.74s)]
*  He says, quote, we know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=469.74s)]
*  He's an easy target, but is safe there. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=474.74s)]
*  We're not going to take him out, kill, at least not for now, but we don't want missiles [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  shot at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=482.54s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=484.54s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=487.14s)]
*  So he's saying we know exactly where Iran's leader is, and we're going to let him live. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=490.34s)]
*  And I feel like this kind of language, we're going to let you live for now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=496.34s)]
*  We're not going to kill you for now. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=500.34s)]
*  But if you shoot at any American asset, any American base in the region, which the Iranians [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=502.34s)]
*  have made quite clear they don't intend to do unless the United States attacks and bombs [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=509.34s)]
*  Iran directly. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=512.9399999999999s)]
*  And obviously, if the United States attacks and bombs Iran directly, you have to expect [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=514.3399999999999s)]
*  that Iran's going to attack back, just like they're doing with Israel. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=519.94s)]
*  I keep hearing these American media people talking about these ballistic missiles sent [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=522.94s)]
*  from Iran as though there's some sort of like aberrational, shockingly immoral, disproportionate [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=526.94s)]
*  response. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=533.5400000000001s)]
*  Israel started the war. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=534.5400000000001s)]
*  Unprovoked, they sent airplanes and missiles and bombs and had intelligence assets inside [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=536.94s)]
*  shooting missiles and bombs, killing the military command, killing their families, killing whoever [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=544.34s)]
*  had the misfortune of living in those buildings, killing all sorts of civilians. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=550.5400000000001s)]
*  Of course, Iran is going to shoot back at Israel with whatever they have, any country [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=554.14s)]
*  would. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=558.34s)]
*  And the same is true for U.S. involvement in the war. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=559.5400000000001s)]
*  If the United States directly starts bombing Iran, as Donald Trump increasingly is hinting [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=562.94s)]
*  and suggesting that he intends to do and all signs suggest is inevitable. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=567.34s)]
*  Of course, Iran is going to then shoot at American bases and American service members [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=572.34s)]
*  and other American interests in the region. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=577.94s)]
*  And then Donald Trump is saying, if you do that, we're going to murder the leader of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=579.94s)]
*  Iran, which if that's a war tactic, I guess it means you can bomb the White House, you [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=583.14s)]
*  can kill Netanyahu. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=588.34s)]
*  Putin can kill Vladimir Zelensky by these standards. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=591.14s)]
*  So this is Trump threatening Iran's leader directly, giving him orders saying, we're [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=596.34s)]
*  going to let you live. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=599.34s)]
*  That's what I say. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=600.34s)]
*  I think that there's a kind of power intoxication that has entered Trump's head. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=601.34s)]
*  I don't mean to psychoanalyze him, but I've certainly never heard him speaking about war [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=606.74s)]
*  and destruction in these kinds of almost messianic terms. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=610.94s)]
*  You know, like he's saying, you're going to sign the deal that we told you to sign. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=615.34s)]
*  And he's basically now saying he's not interested in negotiating any longer. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=622.4200000000001s)]
*  He only wants unconditional surrender. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=625.1800000000001s)]
*  It's like a power kind of dynamic that is driving Trump. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=627.82s)]
*  Remember, this is somebody who ran on a platform of saying he wants his legacy to be a peacemaker, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=632.4200000000001s)]
*  that one of the worst and dumbest things the United States has done, one of the most self-destructive [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=638.94s)]
*  has pursued wars in the Middle East, especially regime change wars, which this is quickly [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=642.22s)]
*  becoming. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=646.6600000000001s)]
*  And now here he is just being pulled every day more and more into it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=648.6600000000001s)]
*  And he seems to be taking a lot of pleasure in it and really enjoying this posture of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=652.58s)]
*  war leader. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=658.1s)]
*  Perhaps of all the things that have been posted, and we're going to still show you some others, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=661.22s)]
*  this might actually be the most disturbing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=664.56s)]
*  This wasn't written by Trump. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=666.06s)]
*  This was written by Mike Huckabee, who is an end times evangelical, someone who believes, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=667.8199999999999s)]
*  and that's why Trump made him U.S. Ambassador to Israel, the first non-Jewish person to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=673.66s)]
*  ever hold that position, that the United States has a biblical mandate to protect and support [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=677.62s)]
*  and strengthen Israel, that Israel has to be fully united and dominate and occupy and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=684.7800000000001s)]
*  control all of the land under it, including the West Bank and Gaza, so that in Mike Huckabee's [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=690.5s)]
*  end times messianic religious view, that's when Jesus will come back and then consign [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=697.5s)]
*  everybody who's a non-believer, including all Jews, to hell unless they first repent [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=704.6600000000001s)]
*  and recognize Jesus as their savior. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=708.74s)]
*  That explains a lot of why there's so much support in the U.S. Congress for paying for [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=713.58s)]
*  Israel, for supporting Israel, for arming Israel. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=718.18s)]
*  It's a religious belief. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=720.42s)]
*  It's a theocratic belief that the Bible mandates that the U.S. government support Israel, strengthen [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=721.66s)]
*  Israel, protect Israel, even more so than it has to protect the United States because [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=729.5s)]
*  this is not a nationalistic mandate, but a biblical one. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=732.58s)]
*  Mike Huckabee wrote Donald Trump a tax that Trump, when he received, obviously was very [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=737.62s)]
*  moved by, believes in, wants the world to see because Trump immediately, or I don't [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=742.02s)]
*  know if it was immediate, but quickly after, went and posted it himself on his true social. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=747.06s)]
*  I think the text of this email is very important. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=755.9s)]
*  It's from Mike Huckabee, a pastor, politician, ambassador, and great person. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=758.26s)]
*  That's what Trump introduced him as. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=762.3s)]
*  Here's the text. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=764.38s)]
*  Quote, Mr. President, God spared you in Butler, Pennsylvania, to be the most consequential [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=765.38s)]
*  president in the century, maybe ever. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=770.26s)]
*  The decisions on your shoulders, I would not want to be made by anyone else. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=773.58s)]
*  You have many voices speaking to you, sir, but there is only one voice that matters, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=776.78s)]
*  his voice. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=781.78s)]
*  I am your appointed servant in this land, and I'm available for you, but I do not try [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=783.3000000000001s)]
*  to get in your presence often because I trust your instincts. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=787.4200000000001s)]
*  No president in my lifetime has been in a position like yours, not since Truman in 1945. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=791.38s)]
*  I don't think anyone's confused about what Mike Huckabee means there. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=799.18s)]
*  What was Harry Truman's consequential decision of 1945? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=801.9s)]
*  What shaped history? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=806.64s)]
*  What made him so consequential? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=807.54s)]
*  Obviously, it was ending World War II by dropping two nuclear bombs on Japan, one in Nagasaki, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=808.54s)]
*  one in Hiroshima. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=816.54s)]
*  And that's obviously what Mike Huckabee is suggesting God wants Trump to do, or at least [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=818.22s)]
*  something very similar to it in this case. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=822.86s)]
*  He goes on, quote, I don't reach out to persuade you, only to encourage you. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=825.38s)]
*  I believe you will hear from heaven, and that voice is far more important than mine or anyone [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=829.42s)]
*  else's. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=833.86s)]
*  You sent me to Israel to be your eyes, ears, and voice, and to make sure our flag flies [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=835.0s)]
*  above our embassy. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=839.02s)]
*  My job is to be the last one to leave. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=840.54s)]
*  I will not abandon this post. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=842.18s)]
*  Our flag will not come down. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=843.46s)]
*  You did not seek this moment the moment sought you. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=845.46s)]
*  It is my honor to serve you, Mike Huckabee. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=848.24s)]
*  Now, the tone of that tax is really not the typical tone of an ambassador to the president. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=852.5400000000001s)]
*  It is basically someone who believes that they are required to assume a supremely humble [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=858.02s)]
*  position because they're talking to a person chosen by God to carry out an extremely important [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=865.6600000000001s)]
*  task. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=871.1s)]
*  And that important task is to force Iran into complete and total surrender, to no longer [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=872.1s)]
*  negotiate with them by using all force necessary to require them to do so. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=878.14s)]
*  It's not a very vague or difficult to discern text. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=883.22s)]
*  Its meaning is viscerally clear, immediately clear. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=888.06s)]
*  And after receiving that email, Donald Trump began posting things like this that suggest [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=893.98s)]
*  that he too sees himself in this manner. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=897.46s)]
*  Here's what he posted in the late morning, early afternoon in all capital letters, all [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=900.26s)]
*  uppercase letters, unconditional surrender, which of course that was the term used by [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=906.74s)]
*  Harry Truman and the British for what they were dictating to the Germans, what they were [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=912.4599999999999s)]
*  dictating to Japan. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=916.54s)]
*  And the idea of using two nuclear weapons in Japan, according to Harry Truman, was the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=921.2199999999999s)]
*  best way, the fastest way, the most effective way to ensure that the Japanese would agree [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=926.2199999999999s)]
*  to unconditional surrender, which is what they agreed to after those nuclear bombs were [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=930.98s)]
*  dropped. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=934.06s)]
*  And history debates whether they were going to anyway, whether it was really necessary, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=935.54s)]
*  but that was the history. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=940.18s)]
*  That's clearly what Mike Huckabee is referencing. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=941.5s)]
*  So we're clearly now in a position where we are dictating the terms of how this war ends. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=945.8199999999999s)]
*  We're not even pretending any longer that this is Israel's war. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=950.78s)]
*  Again, there's no mention by Trump as he talks about Netanyahu or what Israel wants. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=953.38s)]
*  There's no pretense if they're in charge. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=957.5799999999999s)]
*  This is Trump's war. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=959.6199999999999s)]
*  And his posture, the way he's speaking, the way he's writing. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=961.38s)]
*  Everything suggests that he's very intoxicated by this role. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=965.06s)]
*  Here he posted on True Social after that, quote, I have not reached out to Iran for [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=968.98s)]
*  quote peace talks in any way, shape or form, responding to a news report suggesting that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=974.8199999999999s)]
*  he did. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=979.26s)]
*  This is just more highly fabricated fake news. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=980.54s)]
*  If they want to talk, meaning Iran, they know how to reach me. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=983.8199999999999s)]
*  They should have taken the deal that was on the table. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=986.3s)]
*  It would have saved a lot of lives. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=989.06s)]
*  Now again, the deal that was on the table was one that everybody knew in advance that [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=992.06s)]
*  Iran could never and would never accept. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=996.38s)]
*  I think this is one of the points that has become most obscured deliberately, most obfuscated. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=999.5s)]
*  Everybody always understood that Iran was going to have a program of enriching uranium [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1005.66s)]
*  and centrifuges because those are necessary to have a nuclear energy program. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1010.2199999999999s)]
*  And the treaties and conventions that Israel signed give Iran and every other country the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1015.5s)]
*  absolute sovereign right to have a nuclear energy program despite their commitment not [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1022.3s)]
*  to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1027.54s)]
*  And the way that you do that is by ensuring that they're only enriching uranium up to [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1029.74s)]
*  a certain percentage, 3%, 4%, and up to enable them to have nuclear energy but not go to [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1032.3s)]
*  90%, which is where they could have a breakout for nuclear weapons. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1037.3s)]
*  And Steve Woodcoff began the negotiations publicly on Fox by saying that he was subject [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1041.6599999999999s)]
*  to a lot of attacks from this. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1045.86s)]
*  For saying this was that in the negotiations, of course, we're going to be open to having [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1047.6599999999999s)]
*  Iran maintain centrifuges and enrich uranium because the idea is they can have an energy [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1052.3s)]
*  program but not a nuclear program. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1058.34s)]
*  And at some point along the way, a nuclear weapons program, at some point along the way, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1059.6999999999998s)]
*  that completely changed in Trump's mind to any attempt by Iran to demand the right of [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1064.1799999999998s)]
*  enrichment, something they've had forever, something they had in the Iran deal, something [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1070.7s)]
*  that international law accepts that they have the right to have. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1073.0200000000002s)]
*  And that's why they could never give up the right to enrich, the right to nuclear energy [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1076.26s)]
*  because it's a sovereign right that every country has, including them. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1078.94s)]
*  It would be a humiliation for them to give that up, on top of which their view is we [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1081.42s)]
*  want to use nuclear energy to power our country so we can sell our oil to as much as possible, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1086.38s)]
*  that we don't want to consume our oil, we want to sell it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1091.18s)]
*  And so when Trump says they shouldn't have taken the deal that I told them to take, he [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1095.24s)]
*  means a completely untenable deal for Iran, one that they could never and would have never [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1098.46s)]
*  accepted and had that been clear from the start that Trump would have gotten to the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1103.3400000000001s)]
*  point set up for him by Netanyahu and Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, that a deal means [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1107.14s)]
*  dismantling the nuclear program, no enrichment whatsoever. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1111.9s)]
*  There would have been no point negotiating. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1114.18s)]
*  Everybody would have known ahead of time this is going to go nowhere. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1116.1000000000001s)]
*  But Witkoff said the opposite. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1118.94s)]
*  Trump on Air Force One was also asked last night how he sees this war ending. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1122.5600000000002s)]
*  In other words, is he willing to negotiate a ceasefire? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1127.5400000000002s)]
*  Is he willing to go back to the negotiating table to try and get a deal with Iran? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1131.18s)]
*  And I want you not only to pay attention to what he said in response to this question, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1134.1000000000001s)]
*  but kind of the way he said it, the way he stood there and just spat out what you're [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1137.7800000000002s)]
*  about to hear. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1143.22s)]
*  Giving up entirely. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1157.38s)]
*  Is that okay, Jim? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1158.98s)]
*  Are you closer? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1159.98s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1160.98s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1161.98s)]
*  Why not? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1162.98s)]
*  Certainly possible. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1163.98s)]
*  Complete. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1164.98s)]
*  Give up. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1165.98s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1166.98s)]
*  So they asked him, I don't know how well you could hear that, but the audio was clear. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1167.98s)]
*  I think it was a little low. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1172.98s)]
*  It's on an airplane and the like. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1174.98s)]
*  But the reporter asked him, what is it that you're hoping Iran will do? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1176.7800000000002s)]
*  Are you willing to sit down with them and negotiate a ceasefire? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1181.2600000000002s)]
*  He said, not a ceasefire. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1182.98s)]
*  I want an end, a permanent end. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1183.98s)]
*  And he was very careful about specifying that he doesn't want some temporary solution that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1187.34s)]
*  ends the killing. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1192.54s)]
*  He wants Iran to give up. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1193.82s)]
*  And that's what he then went on to say was, or just completely giving up. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1194.82s)]
*  So we had two choices, sort of like a permanent end to this problem or complete giving up. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1199.26s)]
*  And then he went back to true social. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1203.74s)]
*  And that's when he started demanding, we accept nothing less than unconditional surrender. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1206.5s)]
*  Do you know that feeling when your coffee actually does what it's supposed to do? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1211.98s)]
*  I'm not asking you internally. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1218.38s)]
*  I want to know. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1220.06s)]
*  Do you? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1221.06s)]
*  Can you answer in the chat? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1222.06s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1223.06s)]
*  Do you actually know that feeling when coffee does what it's supposed to do? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1224.06s)]
*  Tell me the answer. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1225.98s)]
*  I'm asking. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1226.98s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1227.98s)]
*  It clears your head. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1228.98s)]
*  It lifts your energy. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1229.98s)]
*  It doesn't leave you crashing an hour later. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1230.98s)]
*  That's what good coffee is supposed to feel like. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHom3U3KWo&t=1232.6200000000001s)]
