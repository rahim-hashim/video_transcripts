# Why Is The U.S. Determined To Remove Assad? Syria Expert Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi Explains
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E)
*  Ultimately the overarching question that I have is this one, which is, and again I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=0.0s)]
*  want to just look at it from for the moment a United States perspective, even [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  though President Obama did authorize the CIA program that proved unsuccessful to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=15.8s)]
*  remove Assad, he was widely criticized by both parties in Washington, even by [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Hillary Clinton who was the Secretary of State for kind of restraining the CIA [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=27.64s)]
*  for not letting them really do the sorts of things they felt like they could have [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=32.2s)]
*  done to remove Assad and ultimately Obama came to view the Assad government [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=37.16s)]
*  and the Russian government as potential partners in the region when it came to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=43.36s)]
*  as I said jointly targeting al Qaeda and ISIS organizations that were in Syria [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=49.64s)]
*  that instead of looking as al Qaeda and ISIS as our common allies against Assad [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  it made more sense I think Obama concluded to look at Russia and Syria as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  our allies against the common enemies with these terrorist organizations and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=68.6s)]
*  then Donald Trump came along and sort of made that more explicit by saying [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=73.68s)]
*  why is it in the United States interest to remove the government of Bashar al-Assad [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=78.76s)]
*  I'd rather work with Assad and the Assad government in bombing our common [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  enemies with these which is ISIS and these terrorist organizations and you [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  have Donald Trump and Barack Obama more or less coming to the same conclusion [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=94.44s)]
*  about why the United States maybe not only can live with the Assad regime but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=98.76s)]
*  why it would be better and more in the US interest to have the Assad regime [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=103.76s)]
*  there than the alternative so why is it that despite that rationale despite [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=107.92s)]
*  that recognition that came from Obama through Trump there continues to be [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=114.36s)]
*  this lingering view apparently and not just the West but the United States that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=119.04s)]
*  it is an important strategic goal to destroy the government of Bashar al-Assad [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=124.04s)]
*  even though we may not know who might replace it what is the strategic [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=131.4s)]
*  interest there for the people who still want that I mean does all ultimately [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  even go back to the late 2011 2012 when the US took this stance and said that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=142.44s)]
*  Assad must go and then they committed to that and then initially I think there [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=149.16s)]
*  was this expectation that perhaps really the insurgency could could do it by [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=154.0s)]
*  could do that by itself there was after all a widespread expectation that the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  the government could collapse by the end of 2012 and I heard that from a lot of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=163.68s)]
*  people the time including actually Iraq's national security adviser to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=168.4s)]
*  Prime Minister Nouriel Maliki former adviser that is at the time but that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=173.92s)]
*  didn't happen and you did of course see the Iranians and Hezbollah initially [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=179.16s)]
*  leading the intervention to prop up and support the Syrian government and I think [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=184.2s)]
*  that there was a recognition really that really a military intervention I mean [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=191.64s)]
*  the ones who were more hardline on there I think they had some I think a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=197.28s)]
*  supposition it was correct that to actually really overthrow it you would [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=201.6s)]
*  have to go all the way in and overthrow the government militarily and then of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  course that obviously raises the question of what would what would you do [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=211.32s)]
*  after that and you know and a philosophy an issue of well you broke it so you own [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=215.28s)]
*  it right so this is actually why I think then Obama settled on this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=220.88s)]
*  calibrated pressure strategy which was give support to these CIA vetted groups [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  put pressure on the government and hopefully at some point it will the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=232.92s)]
*  government will feel the pressure enough to come to the table and negotiate this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=238.0s)]
*  political transition I think by the way that was also partly based out of the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=242.64s)]
*  live your experience where you had the overgrowth of that be and you had you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=246.5s)]
*  know this anarchy and today even today the splitting of Libya into two rival [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=249.72s)]
*  governments right so and Iraq as well where you know removing the same regime [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=254.56s)]
*  was not that difficult but what came afterwards was oh no no I fully agree [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=262.88s)]
*  about yeah the Iraq experience I think also informed Obama's calculation though [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=269.56s)]
*  no that's fair and thank you for raising that so yeah the calibrated pressure [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=272.92s)]
*  strategy though I think was mistaken because because as you say when they [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=277.84s)]
*  when the insurgency made major gains in 2015 by taking over at the province it [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  did not problem the government to say okay let's go to the table that you get [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=291.2s)]
*  the Russians to to intervene and at the same time of course with US policy you [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  had this this issue that Islamic State had taken over much of the east of the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=301.23999999999995s)]
*  country and much of the north of it as well and that meant that you know there [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=306.68s)]
*  was this counter IS focus counter as it became a very big focus of US policy and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=313.56s)]
*  hence this relationship they established with the Kurdish led people's protection [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=318.28s)]
*  units of the link to the BKK and then the US rebrand helped rebrand as the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=322.32s)]
*  Syrian Democratic forces even though its approach to governance is actually very [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  much a one-faction hegemonic authoritarian rule actually not very [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=331.92s)]
*  different from a shams approach of one faction hegemonic authoritarian rule [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  albeit with a more a set of feet twist to it so yeah US policy is still very [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  much based on this idea that we keep the consensus blob view as you might call it [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=349.0s)]
*  has been very much based on we keep up this partnership with the Syrian [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=355.92s)]
*  Democratic forces we continue to put pressure on the Syrian government to to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=359.24s)]
*  principally through economic sanctions which have very much helped isolate the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  country and damage the value of its currency and hopefully we can use that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=370.88s)]
*  as leverage to either to make them agree outright to a political transition or [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=375.48s)]
*  has actually came out quite recently in media leaks the that apparently the US [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=381.52s)]
*  and the United Arab Emirates have been discussing to lift some of the US [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=386.72s)]
*  sanctions on Syria in the hope that Assad would perhaps turn would distance [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=390.24s)]
*  himself from Iran this by the way these talks they were going on allegedly [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  before this before this insurgent offensive take place just just the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  context right so that's but I just want to return though to that that question [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=405.44000000000005s)]
*  which I guess was most vividly and explicitly articulated by by Donald [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=410.68s)]
*  Trump certainly during the 2016 campaign which was why is it in the interest of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=418.08s)]
*  the United States to change the government of Iraq if you go and look [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=424.68s)]
*  back at those early parts of the Bush Cheney war and terror they partnered [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=429.12s)]
*  with Assad in a lot of different ways in what they were calling the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=434.36s)]
*  prosecution of the war on terror including sending all sorts of terrorist [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=440.48s)]
*  suspects to Syria to be interrogated with torture that was one of the places [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  we love to send people that we were rendering and picking up and kidnapping [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=451.56s)]
*  to Syria the United States government had a relationship with Syria didn't [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=455.44s)]
*  really like the fact that the Syrians were quote-unquote interfering in Iraq [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=459.36s)]
*  even though the United States was sort of interfering in Iraq as well but that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  was the language of the I understand that there was some tension but when you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=467.6s)]
*  look at the Syrian government which obviously is not a government of Islamic [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=472.04s)]
*  extremism quite the contrary is hostile to Islamic extremists extremism which [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=477.88s)]
*  is why you see this a lot of extremist groups fighting to dislodge Assad what [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  is it about the Assad regime that makes so many people in the United States [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=488.48s)]
*  perceive it to be in the American interest to remove it is it just the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=492.56s)]
*  fact that they're an ally of Iran and removing Assad would weaken Iran [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=497.12s)]
*  despite what might come after that or are there other reasons why so many [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=502.44s)]
*  people on the West seem to think that removing Assad is an important goal I [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  mean when I see people complain morally about the government I can understand [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=512.84s)]
*  that if you're actually consistent about your in your moral beliefs I mean if you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=520.56s)]
*  certainly oppose say repressive security apparatuses of other governments in the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=525.64s)]
*  region and you're actually consistent about that but this is quickly dispensed [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=531.9599999999999s)]
*  with that given how happy that in states is [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=536.76s)]
*  and Egypt so you know I think that's not the reason so I agree that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=540.84s)]
*  fundamentally the reason why the why you know there's policy consensus [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=551.24s)]
*  against the tend to be policy consensus against government is it's precisely [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  because it is seen as this important ally when it is to be fair an important [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=561.24s)]
*  ally of Iran and the broader you might call the resistance axis principally in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=565.76s)]
*  acting as a conduit and logistics archery for supply of weapons that is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=572.24s)]
*  bullet and you know of course ultimately a lot of the issue about designation of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=577.8s)]
*  terrorist groups is the groups we don't like so that's why his bar gets [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=582.64s)]
*  designated as a terrorist group because the only thing the United States doesn't [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=587.6s)]
*  like what it does in fighting against Israel in the past and now so yeah it's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=590.72s)]
*  fundamentally fundamentally a geopolitical thing rather than actually [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  consistent moral principle yeah so Jeffrey Sachs who's a long time leading [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=601.84s)]
*  economist for the United States and has participated in economic rescues in in [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=611.24s)]
*  many parts of the world and has now become integrated as well into a lot of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=617.12s)]
*  the foreign policy apparatus has become a very very very vocal critic of US [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=622.0s)]
*  policy in the Middle East he regards the US supported war in in by Israel and in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=627.28s)]
*  Gaza to be a genocide as a result he's been removed very very quickly from a [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=633.04s)]
*  lot of the mainstream media platforms to which he used to have access but he was [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=638.6s)]
*  on Piers Morgan show for the second time I think Piers Morgan put him on for the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=643.04s)]
*  first time a couple months ago and Piers Morgan as long as it's it produces [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=647.88s)]
*  enough controversy that people pay attention we'll keep putting you on and [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=652.4s)]
*  he was on I think yesterday maybe today to talk about what exactly was happening [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=655.24s)]
*  in in in Syria and Jeffrey Sachs is theory about why it's become so [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=661.56s)]
*  important to remove Assad is that if you go back to the mid 1990s with [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=670.64s)]
*  Netanyahu's book and the emergence of neoconservatism and its modern [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  expression in the United States with Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan and the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=683.6s)]
*  project for new American century they had this list of countries where regime [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=687.08s)]
*  change was crucial both for the Israeli perspective and I guess as a secondary [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=692.08s)]
*  thought for the American perspective and you go down that list and as we know [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=696.92s)]
*  every single one of those countries has been the subject of regime change [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  operations including Libya and Lebanon and obviously Iraq and Syria and the one [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=703.5999999999999s)]
*  left on the list that still hasn't really been undermined yet is the big [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=712.88s)]
*  prize of Netanyahu that he's trying to lure the United States into which is [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=718.5999999999999s)]
*  Iran and so his theory was that this is essentially nothing more than the United [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=723.84s)]
*  States acting in servitude to Israeli interests who have an interest in for [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=729.84s)]
*  example as you said weakening Iran undermining the provision of weapons [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=733.76s)]
*  from Iran to Hezbollah that takes place through Syria and with the consent and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=739.84s)]
*  and cooperation of Syria Hezbollah is a force in the Middle East that targets [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=744.2s)]
*  Israel that does not really target the United States is it an overstatement or [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=748.92s)]
*  is it in essence there is there some truth to it that this is really about [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  Israeli interests wanting to remove Assad more so than making sense from the [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=760.92s)]
*  perspective of American interest to the extent those can be separated? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  I do actually think that's overstated why because if you look at Israel and its [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=770.7199999999999s)]
*  approach to Syria in the war it's actually been a bit more complicated [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=777.76s)]
*  than just one regime change actually within the look at the Israeli discourse [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=781.72s)]
*  I mean there were certain voices who are quite prominently you know quite [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=788.56s)]
*  prominent within you know policy and security circles within Israel like [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=792.88s)]
*  Ehud Yari they were critical of Israel's approach because they felt it wasn't [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=796.96s)]
*  actually they felt it wasn't supportive enough of the insurgency and wasn't [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=801.36s)]
*  anti-Assad enough to actually try to overthrow the government and to be fair [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=805.04s)]
*  the Israel's approach on the broad question of a central government in [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=808.64s)]
*  Syria is that yeah Assad sucks from their perspective because he gives [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=813.76s)]
*  what he has served as his conduit to support Hezbollah but they felt that in [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=818.16s)]
*  the decades before the war broke out you know the Golan front the Golan the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=824.04s)]
*  border of the occupied Golan Heights was fairly quiet and they liked the idea [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  They thought in general that the Israel policy consensus was that if it's a [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=832.8s)]
*  choice between having a central government or just complete anarchy will [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=837.84s)]
*  rather have a central government so therefore Assad can stay barring any [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=842.04s)]
*  alternative any viable alternative to him but at the same time there are we we [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=847.6s)]
*  want this we want this country to be kept weak and divided we wanted they [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=853.84s)]
*  wanted to support this they had this policy of what they call a buffer zone [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=858.96s)]
*  along their borders of supposedly to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from getting [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=863.24s)]
*  to the border of the Golan Heights they at the same time made a commitment to [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=869.44s)]
*  the Druze minority in Israel that there was a certain village over on the other [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=873.96s)]
*  side of the Golan border that they wouldn't let it fall to the insurgents [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=878.0400000000001s)]
*  out of some kind of commitment because of Druze being served in the IDF for [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=881.84s)]
*  example so Israel's policy also was this this melange of different [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=886.48s)]
*  inclinations and it didn't actually go all the way to yeah let's go and support [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=892.32s)]
*  an army rebel army to go march on Damascus and give it s port on the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=898.24s)]
*  contrary in 2018 when the Syrian government Russians took over over the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=903.64s)]
*  south again they weren't invested enough in the insurgents to actually make some [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=907.4s)]
*  forceful stand for them so I agree that fundamentally the US opposition to [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=912.56s)]
*  Syria is a matter of geopolitics because of the resistance axis and the Iran [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=917.16s)]
*  angle but it's not quite though that you know Israel wants to remove Assad [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  because Israel wants that because in fact Israel's approach is a lot more [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=927.1199999999999s)]
*  complicated than that so I hope that's an interesting nuance to to the debate [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=931.0s)]
*  yeah no I mean I'm a big fan of Professor Sacks I was surprised though [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=935.8s)]
*  at how almost single-minded was his perspective about what was taking place [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=939.76s)]
*  in Syria particularly particularly with his insistence that at the core of [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=946.48s)]
*  everything was Netanyahu and almost nothing else and everything kind of flowed from that [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIR85SQF6E&t=953.4s)]
