# The Murderous Life & Legacy of Henry Kissinger: Perfect Symbol of the Rotted US Security State
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0)
*  Now let's look at a few of the specifics of the kinds of things Henry Kissinger did. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the worst was his support for what became the completely savage junta that ruled [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Argentina, the military junta that ruled Argentina in the 1970s in which hundreds of thousands [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=20.6s)]
*  of people were disappeared. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=27.86s)]
*  And here is a national security archive posting from August of 2004 that reveals that Kissinger [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=30.74s)]
*  told the Argentine generals in 1976 who were at the head of this military junta, because [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=39.94s)]
*  this was at a time when these countries that relied on the United States and were in the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=46.86s)]
*  corner of the United States in the Cold War had to observe the limits the United States [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=52.16s)]
*  imposed for what they could and couldn't do. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=57.18s)]
*  And Kissinger wasn't a fan of limits and he told them quote, if there are things that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=61.26s)]
*  you have to do that have to be done you should do them quickly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=65.9s)]
*  A newly declassified document obtained by the National Security Archive shows that amidst [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=71.58s)]
*  vast human rights violations by Argentina security forces in June 1976, Secretary of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=76.3s)]
*  Kissinger told Argentine Foreign Minister Admiral Cesar Agusoguzetti quote, if there [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=82.9s)]
*  are things that have to be done you should do them quickly but you should get back quickly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=88.22000000000001s)]
*  to normal procedures. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  Another document recently unearthed by the National Security Archive and posted for the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  first time there shows that on July 9th, 1976, Secretary Kissinger was explicitly briefed [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=96.72000000000001s)]
*  on the rampant repression taking place in Argentina. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=103.34s)]
*  Quote their theory is that they can use the Chilean method. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=107.7s)]
*  Kissinger's top aid on the Latin America, Henry Schaulderman, informed him quote, that is, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=112.22s)]
*  to terrorize the opposition even killing priests and nuns and others. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=116.66s)]
*  Kissinger reiterated his message during another meeting with Cusetti in New York on October [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=122.9s)]
*  7th telling him the quicker you succeed the better. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=127.06s)]
*  A day earlier on June 9th, 1976, clandestine Argentine security forces had ransacked the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  Catholic Commission for Refugees in Buenos Aires and stolen refugee records. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=136.94s)]
*  The day after Cusetti and Secretary Kissinger met on June 11, 24 Chilean and Uruguayan refugees [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=141.66s)]
*  were kidnapped, held illegally for two days and tortured by a combined Argentine-Chilean-Uruguayan [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=147.38s)]
*  squadron. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=153.9s)]
*  Cusetti also described the intelligence coordination with neighboring dictatorships quote, the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=154.9s)]
*  terrorist problem is general to the entire southern cone. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=159.86s)]
*  To combat it we are encouraging joint efforts to integrate with our neighbors, all of them [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=163.9s)]
*  Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay, Brazil. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=168.26s)]
*  This collaboration was codenamed Operation Condor. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=172.5s)]
*  By the end of 1976, 10,000 Argentines had been disappeared or assassinated by the Argentine [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=175.82s)]
*  security forces. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=182.22s)]
*  Half a dozen American citizens had been kidnapped and tortured. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=183.22s)]
*  On the international front, the cooperation between Argentine military and intelligence [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=186.9s)]
*  forces and other southern cone militaries left hundreds of Uruguayans, Chileans, Bolivians, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=190.18s)]
*  Paraguayans and Brazilians disappeared, tortured and or dead. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=195.06s)]
*  Here is the Buenos Aires Herald, the largest newspaper in Argentina, in April of this year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=202.06s)]
*  I just want you to see these things don't go away in the consciousness of the countries [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=207.86s)]
*  to whom the United States does these things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=212.02s)]
*  When the people in these countries think of the United States, especially when you have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=215.58s)]
*  trained over here saying, come be in our corner. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=219.22s)]
*  We don't invade countries, we don't bomb countries, we don't engineer coups, we want to do business [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=224.61999999999998s)]
*  with you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=229.2s)]
*  These perceptions linger for obvious reasons. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  If you lived in a country where there was a bloody coup and a bloodbath that followed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=234.89999999999998s)]
*  where the government that you or your parents voted for was removed from power with the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=241.1s)]
*  help of a foreign government wanting to control your country and its resources and imposed [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=248.18s)]
*  on your parents or your family or your country was a brutal dictatorship that slaughtered [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=252.74s)]
*  tens of thousands of dissidents and journalists and activists and members of the opposition [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  party and piled up bodies by disappearing them and you knew the United States or some [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=263.1s)]
*  other country was directly responsible for it, of course you would have great animosity [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=267.42s)]
*  toward that other country and you wouldn't trust the things they say and you would scoff [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=271.62s)]
*  at the idea that they're devoted to spreading freedom and democracy around the world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  When they start a new war and they say we want to go help you would of course be very [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  cynical and abjaded about that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=283.34s)]
*  And the more countries where that happens, talking about large countries here, then of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=287.02s)]
*  course the more anti-Americanism there's going to be in the world. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  And if you're the only superpower and there's no alternative then on some level you let [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=299.02s)]
*  countries do in their resentment and there's not much that they can do but the minute there's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=303.86s)]
*  a multipolar world or some alternative those countries can't wait to put the knife in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  the back of the United States because they feel like they've been waiting decades if [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  not generations for vengeance. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=320.1s)]
*  This is the sort of thing that has serious consequences all over the world. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=324.06s)]
*  This is the Buenos Aires Herald from this year. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=329.3s)]
*  Forty-six years of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=331.54s)]
*  They took on the dictatorship looking for their children and have not stopped since. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=335.62s)]
*  Once a week, come rain or shine, a group of mothers gathers in a Buenos Aires square and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=339.5s)]
*  walks. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=344.14s)]
*  They wear white handkerchiefs tied to their heads with names sewn on to them. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=345.14s)]
*  Today marks the 46th anniversary of their first demonstration on April 30th, 1977. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=348.7s)]
*  On that Saturday, the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo first got together at the square which [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=355.02s)]
*  would give them their name. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=360.17999999999995s)]
*  Since then they have returned demanding to know the fate of their disappeared children [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=361.9s)]
*  2,392 times. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=365.14s)]
*  In 1977, as silence and fear coated social life in Argentina, the Buenos Aires Herald [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=367.17999999999995s)]
*  was one of the few media outlets that reported on the forced disappearances denounced by [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=374.17999999999995s)]
*  families and friends of those who went missing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  The Mothers as well as the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo would visit the Herald's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=380.7s)]
*  newsroom to tell their stories and provide information for its reporters to write about [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=384.06s)]
*  what was otherwise completely made invisible. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=388.54s)]
*  Now, let's assume you're in Argentina and you know that one of the people who enabled [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=392.26s)]
*  all that to happen in your country was Henry Kissinger who representing the most powerful [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=400.14s)]
*  country on earth, polled the generals who had assumed dictatorial control of your country, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=405.34000000000003s)]
*  go take care of whatever you need to take care of in the quickest way possible knowing [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=411.86s)]
*  that they were talking about exactly this, giving them the green light, the go ahead, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=415.3s)]
*  providing them the support and the arms needed to stay in power as they did it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=419.7s)]
*  These are things you don't learn in American schools. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=425.1s)]
*  I went to school, elementary school, middle school, high school in the United States. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=429.3s)]
*  I know what I was taught about my country and what I should think about my country and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=434.94s)]
*  this history was not included, but it is included in most of the world. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=438.34s)]
*  And it's a reason why so often Americans think other people in other parts of the world are [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  crazy in their views. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=449.78s)]
*  But maybe that's because we are as propagandized as any other place in the world and maybe [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=451.73999999999995s)]
*  our perspective of our country's role in the world is what is distorted or incomplete. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=459.14s)]
*  Again, it is very hard to say what the worst thing Kissinger did. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  I probably would put Laos and Cambodia at the top. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=470.74s)]
*  One of the worst things in the United States in the latter half of the 20th century was [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=474.54s)]
*  its very close partnership with the extremely savage dictators of Indonesia, the military [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=477.54s)]
*  leaders of Indonesia, and the mass murder, the genocide really that they perpetrated [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=485.14s)]
*  Denise Timor. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=494.5s)]
*  And Henry Kissinger was at the heart of that as well, as was the entire United States government. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=497.18s)]
*  Indonesia is today one of the top four or five most populous countries on the planet. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=502.82s)]
*  And Indonesians also know of this history, of course, much better than the United States [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=509.42s)]
*  does. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=512.94s)]
*  So imagine you're in Argentina, you're in Indonesia and Henry Kissinger dies and you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=515.28s)]
*  see Joe Biden and Blinken and Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush saying this was the greatest [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=519.7s)]
*  man, we loved him, we took advice from him to this very day we did. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=526.26s)]
*  A month ago I was taking advice from Henry Kissinger. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=529.86s)]
*  What would you think about the United States government? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=533.22s)]
*  From the Washington Post in 2001, the 1975 East Timor invasion got US go ahead. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=537.34s)]
*  President Gerald R. Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger gave Indonesian [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=545.66s)]
*  President Suharto, easily one of the worst monsters of the 20th century, the go ahead [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=549.7199999999999s)]
*  for Indonesia's 1975 invasion of East Timor that left at least 200,000 people dead. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=555.5799999999999s)]
*  Newly declassified documents show it has long been suspected that Ford and Kissinger approved [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=562.06s)]
*  the invasion of the former Portuguese colony. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=567.02s)]
*  They met with Suharto in Jakarta on December 6, 1975, the day before he sent Indonesian [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=569.72s)]
*  forces into East Timor. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=575.38s)]
*  In a secret State Department telegram, Ford and Kissinger assured Suharto that they would [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  not object to what the Indonesian leader termed, quote, rapid or drastic action in East Timor. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  Quote, we will understand and will not press you on the issue, Ford said, according to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=587.72s)]

*  Kissinger told Suharto, quote, it is important that whatever you do succeeds quickly. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=602.72s)]
*  Same thing he told the Argentinian generals. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=608.36s)]
*  He also urged Suharto to wait until he and Ford returned to the United States, quote, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=610.82s)]
*  the president will be back on Monday at 2 p.m. Jakarta time, he said. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=614.96s)]
*  We understand your problem and the need to move quickly, but I'm only saying it would [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=618.88s)]
*  be better if it were done until after we return. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=621.76s)]
*  Ford said that was the only request that he had of Indonesia, knowing they were going [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=625.24s)]
*  to invade and massacre the people of East Timor. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=629.94s)]
*  He said, just do us a favor, wait until we're back home for you to start it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=633.58s)]
*  Now, you might be thinking, well, why is it the responsibility of the United States to [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=638.22s)]
*  stop Indonesia from invading and massacring the people of East Timor? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=642.1800000000001s)]
*  That is not the point. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=646.9200000000001s)]
*  The point is that the United States had helped put these people in power. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=649.1800000000001s)]
*  We're propping them up in power with military-aided money. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=654.62s)]
*  They were controlling Indonesia like they control so many countries today through aid [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=658.66s)]
*  and through weaponry. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=662.98s)]
*  So it wasn't as a question of the United States failed under Henry Kissinger to take action [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=665.3s)]
*  to stop atrocities in other countries. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=669.86s)]
*  It was Henry Kissinger who gave it the green light, who enabled it to happen. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=672.36s)]
*  Massive amounts of bodies piled up by supporting dictatorship at the same time that the American [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=676.62s)]
*  people largely believed because their media and their government told them that all of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  these wars and all of these military actions and all of the CIA cues were all designed [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=689.84s)]
*  to just make the world freer, when in fact we were implanting and controlling the most [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=695.6s)]
*  savage despots on the planet, the exact opposite of what the American people were told to believe [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=703.2s)]
*  about their country. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=707.88s)]
*  Here from Sciences Po in October of 2011, three centuries of violence and struggle in [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=711.52s)]
*  East Timor, quote, incidents of mass violence have on many occasions made East Timor a focus [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=716.4s)]
*  of attention. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=721.04s)]
*  That has received the greatest media coverage. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=722.84s)]
*  Those that received the greatest media coverage were perpetrated during the Indonesian occupation [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=725.72s)]
*  from 1975 to 1990, which saw the death of 20 to 25 percent of a population that totaled [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=729.54s)]
*  700,000 in 1975. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=738.04s)]
*  So when we're talking about 200,000 people being massacred and murdered in this invasion [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=742.7199999999999s)]
*  that Henry Kissinger said, just the only request I have is you wait until we're back home, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=750.48s)]
*  turn that out of a population of 700,000. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=754.4s)]
*  They wiped out a quarter of the population. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=759.78s)]
*  In December 1978, the Indonesian military admitted to having interned 372,900 Timorese [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=763.72s)]
*  people, 60 percent of the population, in 150 camps, confined in with very little land to [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=769.6800000000001s)]

*  Cross says, quote, was as bad as Biafra and potentially as dramatic as Cambodia. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=781.52s)]
*  The situation did not improve in subsequent years. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=787.5600000000001s)]
*  Three other famines occurred in 1981, 1982, 1984, 1987. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=790.2s)]
*  This is a monster, Henry Kissinger, and his view of the world was very clear, which was [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=799.52s)]
*  if anything in some way advances American interests, then we should do it regardless [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=807.22s)]
*  of the body count, regardless of the ethical considerations or the moral considerations [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=814.82s)]
*  or the legal considerations. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=820.5400000000001s)]
*  In other words, we're not interested in the democracy of other countries at all, even [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=821.5400000000001s)]
*  though we keep saying that that's what makes us better than the Soviet Union, even though [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=825.86s)]
*  we keep telling the American people that that's what our project is. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=829.1400000000001s)]
*  Our project is the opposite. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=834.38s)]
*  Henry Kissinger's view was not that we should sit at home and ignore the rest of the world. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=835.7800000000001s)]
*  That's an isolationist view. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=842.94s)]
*  Henry Kissinger was not an isolationist. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=844.0600000000001s)]
*  He was the opposite. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=845.7800000000001s)]
*  He was an interventionist. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=847.0200000000001s)]
*  He wanted to go around intervening in other parts of the world, not under the pretense [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=849.58s)]
*  of helping those countries, although, of course, that was the propaganda, but not his pretense [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=854.94s)]
*  that he would offer to himself. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=860.2600000000001s)]
*  Instead, it was if we need something that we want to take here, if we need to control [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  a country here, we're going to put in whoever we want and whatever the cost is in terms [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=867.1400000000001s)]
*  of human life to do it is the cost we're going to pay. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=870.7s)]
*  It's like a sociopathic foreign policy spread all over the world. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=875.7s)]
*  This morning, one of the senior foreign policy officials in the Obama administration, Ben [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=884.86s)]
*  Rhodes, with whom I've had all kinds of clashes and for whom I have all kinds of critiques, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=890.7s)]
*  wrote an article in the New York Times about Henry Kissinger's death that was very mildly [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=896.66s)]
*  headlined Henry Kissinger, the hypocrite. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=901.98s)]
*  But it was actually a much better and more scathing indictment of Henry Kissinger than [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=904.1s)]
*  that headline suggests. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=912.06s)]
*  Now, ironically, a lot of the critiques that Ben Rhodes made of Henry Kissinger apply very [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=914.38s)]
*  much so to the Obama administration and to Obama officials. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=922.58s)]
*  But nonetheless, it was a critique that you don't often hear of the American foreign policy [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=928.22s)]
*  community from a top level foreign policy official published in the New York Times. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=934.7s)]
*  And one of the focal points of this op-ed was this illegal war that Henry Kissinger [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=939.9s)]
*  and Richard Nixon started where we were in the Vietnam War and we were losing. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=945.66s)]
*  That of course what the Pentagon papers proved that American officials knew we were losing. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=953.9s)]
*  We were unlikely to win, that a stalemate was the best possibility. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=958.1s)]
*  While we were telling the public, while the government was telling the public for all [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=962.2199999999999s)]
*  those years that victory was six months away, that they just had to keep being a little [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=966.18s)]
*  more patient and paying for a little bit more and sending their sons to die in the juggles [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=970.22s)]
*  of Vietnam inside the Pentagon, inside the White House, including in the Nixon administration, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=974.28s)]
*  they knew that victory was impossible. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=979.48s)]
*  And it was Daniel Ellsberg who exposed that in the Pentagon papers and that was why Nixon [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=982.92s)]
*  and Kissinger despised Daniel Ellsberg. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=986.8s)]
*  They broke into his psychoanalyst office. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=990.48s)]
*  Henry Kissinger suggested he was a Soviet agent because he exposed the truth. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=992.28s)]
*  One of the things that happened as part of the Vietnam War was that Nixon and Kissinger [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=997.88s)]
*  started a secret war that not even the U.S. Congress knew about in Cambodia and Laos on [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1005.16s)]
*  the other side of the Vietnam border based on the view that there were Viet Cong operating [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1009.68s)]
*  from Cambodia and Laos and it was at a time when the Americans really were getting humiliated [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1015.4s)]
*  and starting to lose the war. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1020.9s)]
*  And the order that Kissinger gave to the Pentagon, to the military, to take this illegal war, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1023.8000000000001s)]
*  this secret war that was not known to the Congress let alone authorized by it, let alone [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1029.64s)]
*  to the American people, was to shoot and bomb everything that moves. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1033.64s)]
*  Shoot and bomb everything that moves. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1039.16s)]
*  The United States dropped so much ordinance on Laos and Cambodia that it might have been [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1041.88s)]
*  the most amount of bombing it did including World War II as I'm about to show you. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  To this very day, children of Laos are killed when they find undetonated bombs and traps [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1055.12s)]
*  of all kinds in their country. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1062.76s)]
*  It was one of the most savage and indiscriminate war crimes committed in that time. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1067.02s)]
*  It was domestically illegal and morally reprehensible. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1073.92s)]
*  And we all know it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1081.28s)]
*  Hillary Clinton knows it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1082.92s)]

*  And yet, just nothing but oozing praise for this person while we report to be the moral [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1090.68s)]
*  authority and beacon of freedom in the world. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1098.0800000000002s)]
*  For him, this is Ben Rhodes in the New York Times, credibility for Kissinger, credibility [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1100.88s)]
*  was rooted in what you did more than what you stood for, even when those actions rendered [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1105.2600000000002s)]
*  American concepts of human rights and international law void. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1110.96s)]

*  rained down more bombs than it dropped on Germany and Japan in World War II. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1121.0800000000002s)]
*  That bombing, often indiscriminately massacring civilians, did nothing to improve the terms [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1127.58s)]
*  on which the Vietnam War ended. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1133.34s)]
*  If anything, it just indicated the lengths the United States would go to express his [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1134.78s)]
*  displeasure at losing. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1139.72s)]

*  of global affairs. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1146.54s)]
*  After all, history is written by men like Henry Kissinger, not by the victims of superpower [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1148.84s)]

*  Now one of the major culprits in all of this has been the corporate media and I've talked [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1218.8799999999999s)]
*  many times before about how people like to debate what is the ideological bias of the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  corporate media. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1229.8s)]
*  I was thinking about this recently in fact when if you ask supporters of Israel, they [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1230.8s)]
*  will tell you that the New York Times is one of the most viciously anti-Israeli pro-Palestinian [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1237.96s)]
*  newspapers on the planet. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1243.8400000000001s)]
*  But if you ask pro-Palestinian activists, they will tell you the New York Times is a [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1246.56s)]
*  fanatically Zionist newspaper that's owned by a family, the Salzberger family, that are [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1251.7s)]
*  fanatical supporters of Israel. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1258.02s)]
*  They editorialize in favor of Israel. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  And it made me realize that people love to complain about the media being biased, everyone [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1262.64s)]
*  insists the media is being biased. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1267.66s)]
*  I've never once heard, never once, anyone say the media is biased but on this particular [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1269.18s)]
*  important issue it's biased in favor of my view. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1277.9s)]
*  Everyone always thinks the media is against it, against them, everybody. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1280.7s)]
*  But when people argue is the media a bias toward the left, is it biased toward the right? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1286.8000000000002s)]
*  I do think on cultural issues and the like you can have that debate and they're clearly [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1293.86s)]
*  biased toward the left. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  On cultural issues like abortion and LGBT issues and gun control, those sorts of things. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1299.54s)]
*  But on issues of war and foreign policy, it's absolutely not a bias of the left or the right. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1306.0s)]
*  The bias is subservience to the security state. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1313.1399999999999s)]

*  years of autocracy in Chile. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1799.2s)]
*  The files published by the NSA made clear Kissinger's central role in the Chilean coup. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1801.76s)]
*  In 1970, he warned Nixon that Chile would become, quote, the worst failure of his administration [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1806.76s)]
*  and that it might develop into, quote, our Cuba without U.S. intervention. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1812.2s)]
*  He chaired the committee that oversaw CIA operations to undermine the Lendi government, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1816.62s)]
*  quote, I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1820.82s)]
*  irresponsibility of its people. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1825.1599999999999s)]
*  Kissinger said the issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1828.82s)]
*  for themselves. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1834.4599999999998s)]
*  Now, as any of you know, I live in Brazil and have lived here for 18 years and my husband [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1835.4599999999998s)]
*  was a congressman and I started a media outlet here and did reporting in Brazil. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1842.18s)]
*  I know Brazilian political culture quite well. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1846.8600000000001s)]
*  And Brazil had its own U.S. sponsored coup in 1964. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1851.26s)]
*  And that wasn't on the ledger of Henry Kissinger. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1857.5800000000002s)]
*  He wasn't in government yet. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1859.66s)]
*  But it was very similar to the kinds of coups Henry Kissinger loved to engineer all over [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1861.18s)]
*  the world. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1865.3s)]
*  And Brazil had elected not even a left-wing government, a center-left government that [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1868.14s)]
*  was doing things like offering land reform and rent control. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1872.6200000000001s)]
*  And first the Kennedy administration and the Johnson administration said, we're concerned [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1877.5400000000002s)]
*  you're moving too far left. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1882.14s)]
*  Remember, this is a democratically elected government in Brazil. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1883.3000000000002s)]
*  The CIA, JFK, and Lyndon Johnson are sitting in Washington telling the Brazilians thousands [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1886.42s)]
*  of miles away. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1894.06s)]
*  You're moving too far left in your economic policies and if you don't stop that, we're [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1897.1399999999999s)]
*  going to do something about it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1902.74s)]
*  And the Brazilian president said, I was elected by the Brazilian people. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1905.5s)]
*  We have radical economic inequality and I intend to fix that. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1909.06s)]
*  And Brazil was determined to be neutral, to stay out of the access of the United States [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1914.82s)]
*  or the Soviet Union in the Cold War. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1918.58s)]
*  But neutrality wasn't enough for Washington. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1922.7s)]
*  They demanded that governments be fully pro-Washington. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1924.9s)]
*  And so the CIA under LBJ worked hand-in-hand with Brazilian generals to violently overthrow [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1929.0s)]
*  the democratically elected government in Rio de Janeiro that was the capital of Brazil [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1934.24s)]
*  at the time, force the Brazilian president into exile, took over the country, and proceeded [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1938.9s)]
*  to rule Brazil as a military dictatorship supported by the US and the UK for the next [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1946.14s)]
*  21 years from 1964 until 1985 when it began to redemocratize. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1951.42s)]
*  And there was all kinds of brutality, disappeared journalists, exiled dissidents, murdered and [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1958.02s)]
*  disappeared people of all kinds. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1964.46s)]
*  And obviously the shadow of that dictatorship hangs over Brazil. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1967.46s)]
*  And if you ask somebody who's in Brazil what they think of the United States, that coup [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1970.94s)]
*  60 years ago is going to color what they think of the United States and what they think of [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1976.46s)]
*  the United States claims that they're going to war to protect democracy and spread freedom. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1981.8600000000001s)]
*  And this repeats itself over and over and over and over. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1986.54s)]
*  What was done in Brazil was not even close to the top of the list of horrors, but it [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1988.98s)]
*  still shapes views of the United States in a way that I think many Americans are incapable [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=1993.42s)]
*  of understanding because they aren't told that history. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=2000.98s)]
*  So when they hear this anti-American sentiment they think people just hate the United States [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=2004.04s)]
*  irrationally. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=2007.3999999999999s)]
*  And so much of this was on the ledger of Henry Kissinger. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dSCLaAPH0&t=2010.32s)]
