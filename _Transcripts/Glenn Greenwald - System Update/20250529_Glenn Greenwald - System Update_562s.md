# Democrats' Narcissism on FULL DISPLAY
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU)
*  And just as the final nail in the coffin, which is perhaps a metaphor now that I said [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=0.0s)]
*  it out loud, that's in poor taste, is this piece of the puzzle where we have had, if [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=11.84s)]
*  we pull up the graphic, a significant number of Democrats who have quite literally died [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=18.04s)]
*  a margin that would have prevented the Democrats or enabled the Democrats to block the passage [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=24.84s)]
*  of Biden's big, beautiful budget bill in the House had they stayed alive. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=31.28s)]
*  Now, remember, DNC vice chair David Hogg got an enormous amount of pushback for simply [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=35.6s)]
*  saying he wanted to start a PAC that funded challengers to incumbents, observing accurately [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  that younger members of the party like AOC and people who are outsiders like Bernie Sanders [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=50.04s)]
*  are the ones that have managed to capture whatever energy is left in the husk of the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  Democratic Party. And for that, Democrat elites have rallied the ranks to literally push him [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  out of his position at the DNC and are frankly using sort of identity politics as a lover [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=67.4s)]
*  to get him out. Even as Democrats are unable to whip sufficient votes to block Biden's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=72.96s)]
*  priorities, precisely because their members are so old and enfeebled, they are quite literally [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=79.96s)]
*  dying in office. What do you make of it? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=85.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, of course, the final nail in the coffin was the perfect turn of phrase. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=88.36s)]
*  But what better represents the narcissism and selfishness and moribund nature of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  Democrats than the way that they are refusing to resign? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=99.6s)]
*  Because again, this this gets back to the idea of, you know, the Democrats are constantly [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  fear mongering. And I want to be clear. I mean, Trump is is something to be feared. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=107.83999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he is not a he's not an anti-war candidate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=112.0s)]
*  He is terrible for many reasons. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=115.63999999999999s)]
*  The Democrats often criticize him for the things that aren't even that bad, which is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=118.8s)]
*  another irony. But, you know, they fear monger. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  They say he's an existential threat. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  He's a fascist. And yet, if they're so worried about this, why don't they retire so that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  they have a better chance of having someone in from the Democratic Party who can vote [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  against his bill? I mean, literally his bill passed because Democrats refused to resign [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=137.44s)]
*  despite having being very sick or old. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=142.44s)]
*  And it reminds me also of the way that if if Kamala Harris cared so much about defeating [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=146.28s)]
*  Trump, if this was the most important election ever, then why didn't she listen to the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=152.6s)]
*  base, which was clamoring for her to depart from Biden on several issues and most notably [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=157.28s)]
*  on Gaza? We know now that from someone who worked with her, it was because she didn't [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  want to be rude. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=167.28s)]
*  And it's not it's gauche to depart from your president's policies when you're the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=168.84s)]
*  running mate. We also know that Joe Biden said we don't want any I don't want any [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=173.24s)]
*  daylight between us, kid. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  And so for Biden, his legacy, much like these Democrats who are dying in office, their [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=180.04s)]
*  legacies are more important than defeating Trump and Trumpism or helping the people that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  they claim to serve. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=191.56s)]
*  For Kamala, not I guess ruffling feathers was more important or not upsetting donors [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=193.28s)]
*  or not being able to run around with Liz Cheney or not incurring the wrath of AIPAC. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  So it just belies the whole claim that this is something that is an existential threat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=204.04s)]
*  I think that I mean, we are facing existential threats. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=208.88s)]
*  We're facing existential threats that neither party is willing to deal with, especially [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to climate change. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=215.88s)]
*  But the it's very hard to convince people that you're taking this seriously as an [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=217.4s)]
*  existential threat when you don't do the minimal things needed to either win an election [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=222.64s)]
*  or prevent a Republican from taking your seat in the case of people who are not resigning. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's really hard, frankly, to see in concurrent election cycles, the voting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=233.88s)]
*  population stand up and clearly, clearly be clamoring for a legitimate, sincere populism. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=240.28s)]
*  I mean, the outrage around inflation, cost of living, housing prices, gas prices, food [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=246.56s)]
*  prices, education prices. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  These are the sectors that are driving inflation and which are causing life to be so [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  precarious for so many Americans. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=261.76s)]
*  It's nice now that Democrats are like acknowledging that economic precarity, economic [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=263.32s)]
*  anxiety is a real thing because for, I don't know, like eight years after the 2015-2016 [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=267.88s)]
*  cycle, they acted if you said, well, yeah, people voted for Trump because of economic [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=274.96s)]
*  anxiety. They said, oh, that's just racism. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=278.56s)]
*  That's just a synonym for racism. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=280.88s)]
*  We won't take that argument. So now they're finally embracing it and trying to say we're [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=282.24s)]
*  going to do a Joe Rogan sort of a situation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=285.36s)]
*  But again, they're not backing any of those policies. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=287.48s)]
*  You're still getting Democrats out here arguing against baseline things like raising the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=289.92s)]
*  minimum wage, which hasn't been raised since Bush was in office, the longest period without [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=294.76s)]
*  a minimum wage raise since it was invented in like the 1930s. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=298.8s)]
*  And meanwhile, Americans are struggling. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  So this huge lane is opening up. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the right side of the aisle, I think people who voted for Donald Trump in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=307.04s)]
*  good faith, hoping that he was going to follow the sort of Bannon wing of his party and do [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=310.12s)]
*  real economic populism are seeing that Bannon is engaged in a battle with the other wing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=314.0s)]
*  of the party that frankly bought the election. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=319.48s)]
*  The tech wing, the Elon Musk, the Mark Andreessen, the folks who are very openly saying we [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=321.36s)]
*  need to do AI, we need to put the public out of business. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=325.92s)]
*  We're going to make all of these arguments that legitimize defunding the welfare state [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=329.92s)]
*  that so many Americans, including so many Americans in very low income red states in the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=335.8s)]
*  South and elsewhere, are relying upon to survive. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=340.48s)]
*  And we can do that because we literally bought this election. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=343.72s)]
*  And I'm afraid that that tech wing, the billionaire wing who has no alignment of interest [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=346.36s)]
*  for the working class in this country, most of whom are frankly not even American or [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=352.52s)]
*  relatively recent transplants, are going to win out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=357.48s)]
*  And it's going to be too late for a genuine populism to actually restore democracy [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=360.68s)]
*  that reflects the people's values. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=366.4s)]
*  What do you think? I think it's a justifiable fear. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=367.84s)]
*  And I think what you're saying, it really does ring true. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=372.32s)]
*  Again, we've seen in the cases of of the leadership of both parties, we've seen a real [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  embrace of anti-populism. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=382.11999999999995s)]
*  And one of the most frustrating things was to see people equate Bernie Sanders with Donald [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=385.52s)]
*  Trump because there's a big difference between actual populism and pseudo populism, just [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  like there's a big difference between being anti-war and being pseudo anti-war. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=395.88s)]
*  And Trump is great at appealing to populist sentiments. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  But of course, he's not someone who cares about the working class, the middle class. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  He is someone who in some ways is more dangerous than traditional Republicans because he [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  talks a good talk. He knows how to sound like he's a populist. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  He knows how to sound like he's against the status quo. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=416.32s)]
*  But of course, in some ways, the most dangerous thing to have is someone who substantively [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=419.04s)]
*  is status quo, but performatively and stylistically is not. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=423.8s)]
*  Yeah, it is interesting to see him float things like we're going to do a tax on the rich, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=428.64s)]
*  right? But then walk it back. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=432.68s)]
*  And you can read that in a couple of different ways. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=435.2s)]
*  You can say Donald Trump is just a bad faith actor he never met in the first place, or [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  you can read it as well. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  He actually is someone who's got a good sense of what the wind is blowing and what the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=444.64s)]
*  base wants. And maybe he would be happy to do a little bit. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=447.84s)]
*  You know, he's a billionaire himself. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=451.2s)]
*  You know, I wouldn't take it too far that he was willing would be willing to do too much [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  redistributive justice to return the hardworking, increased productivity of the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=456.12s)]
*  working classes back into their pockets the way that it was 50 years ago or so before a [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=462.12s)]
*  bunch of laws redistributed to the very top, including Trump's own 2017 tax cuts. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=466.4s)]
*  I wouldn't take it too far. But there's a way you could read it that says, well, maybe [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=472.16s)]
*  Trump did get a sense that, you know, you need bread and roses. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=474.8s)]
*  You need to get the masses a little bit to keep them on your on your on your team and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=477.56s)]
*  that the corporate interests within his own party won't even let him do the bare minimum. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=482.56s)]
*  And so it's not clear to me how much there is a real war between the Steve Bannon to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  seem to be more genuinely committed to working class politics, even if it's also mixed [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7C0U7F1NuU&t=492.15999999999997s)]
