# Jeffrey Sachs Tears Apart Biden's Ukraine/Israel Catastrophes
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY)
*  Professor Sachs, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's always great to talk to you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=8.6s)]
*  Likewise. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=10.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=11.6s)]
*  So every time we get together, we talk about war, which I guess is the nature of being [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=12.6s)]
*  an American. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=17.16s)]
*  When we talked to you six months ago, there was one war. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=18.52s)]
*  When we talked to you two months ago, there were two. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=20.7s)]
*  Now there are many. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=22.36s)]
*  It's hard to know where to begin, but why don't we just start with Ukraine, which is [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=23.36s)]
*  the oldest one and work our way up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=26.36s)]
*  There seems to be a lot of chaos in Kiev, where President Zelensky just fired his top [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=28.68s)]
*  commander. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=32.44s)]
*  There's certainly chaos in Washington, where they can't figure out how to get the next [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=33.44s)]
*  $60 billion to Ukraine, even though they want to. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=36.64s)]
*  What do you make of where we are in this war? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=39.76s)]
*  Well, on the battlefield, Russia is taking apart Ukraine, and the death toll for the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=42.24s)]
*  Ukrainians is terrifying. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=50.72s)]
*  But Washington remains steadfast on one point, which is no negotiations, no discussion of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=54.54s)]
*  real solutions, a war-only approach. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=62.66s)]
*  It's pathetic, absolutely pathetic. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=66.82s)]
*  And the idea of putting another $61 billion into more deaths for Ukraine, more destruction [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=70.5s)]
*  for Ukraine, without a word about politics and a solution to this, is Biden's complete [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=77.8s)]
*  failure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=86.44s)]
*  So I find the situation shocking. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=87.84s)]
*  I find it shocking that a large part of the Senate and almost all of the Democratic Party [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=91.64s)]
*  mindlessly goes along with this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=97.32s)]
*  We have heard since those two months even more stories about how the US stopped the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=100.46s)]
*  negotiated settlement in 2022. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=107.17999999999999s)]
*  This is mind-boggling in the complete absence of any interest whatsoever in ending this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  war. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=120.1s)]
*  Well, let me ask you about that, because you've been a critic from the start of the US role [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=121.1s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=125.58s)]
*  I have as well. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=126.58s)]
*  There's no consolation to have been vindicated given how disastrous the war has been. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=127.7s)]
*  But certainly everything you're describing now is visible to everybody in Washington, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=132.18s)]
*  even if somehow it wasn't at the start of the war, that Ukraine cannot win. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=138.06s)]
*  There's no way to expel all Russian troops from Ukrainian soil, let alone from Crimea. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=141.34s)]
*  There's just no possibility of any of those objectives being fulfilled. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=146.14s)]
*  What at this point do you think is the objective? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=149.7s)]
*  And looking back, what has been the objective all along? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=153.78s)]
*  Well, I think the objective all along for the last 30 years was to put the US and NATO [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=158.42s)]
*  into Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=165.1s)]
*  And at each point, Biden, Sullivan, Blinken, Nuland, this has been going on for more than [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=166.98s)]
*  a decade. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=176.34s)]
*  And before that, it was Nuland as part of the Bush administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=177.34s)]
*  They thought they could bluff their way in or frighten Putin on their way in and so forth. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=181.74s)]
*  It's just been one stupid, cruelly ignorant miscalculation after another. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=187.62s)]
*  They got to the point where every gambit failed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=194.22s)]
*  The only thing that they accomplished was spending more than 100 billion of US money [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=197.66s)]
*  and about 500,000 casualties in Ukraine, a catastrophe. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=201.86s)]
*  And now they have an election coming. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  So to my mind, at least one part of this story is just get to November without an embarrassment. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=210.98s)]
*  No matter how many more deaths they cause, another 61 billion dollars doesn't matter. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  It's not their money. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=223.66s)]
*  They're just trying to avoid embarrassment for what has been an absolutely disgraceful [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=225.14s)]
*  foreign policy for a decade. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=232.33999999999997s)]
*  We're in the 10th anniversary of Biden, Nuland, Blinken, Sullivan participating in the overthrow [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=236.9s)]
*  of the Anikovych government. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=243.18s)]
*  And this is what it's brought. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=244.86s)]
*  Complete disaster for Ukraine and nothing good for the United States. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=246.82s)]
*  Guess if there's one silver lining, it's the fact that this request for 60 billion dollars [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=251.5s)]
*  has been pending before the Congress for several months now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=257.12s)]
*  They struggled for a long time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=260.46s)]
*  As of this week, they're trying everything and so far nothing's working, not just to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=263.38s)]
*  send 60 billion dollars to Ukraine, but also another 17 billion dollars to Israel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=267.54s)]
*  Is this just something that you think is kind of an election year theater in Congress where [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=272.32s)]
*  they're kind of trading for things and eventually will send it? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=278.12s)]
*  Or do you think it actually reflects some change in the politics in terms of what Americans [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=281.62s)]
*  think about sending huge amounts of money to finance other countries' wars when our [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=286.02s)]
*  country is in many ways falling apart? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=290.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think it is exactly the fact the Americans are completely against this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=292.58000000000004s)]
*  Spend another 61 billion dollars with the massive budget deficits, with the cuts in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  essential services. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=304.1s)]
*  I point out in a post today that the 61 billion exceeds our nutrition programs for women and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=305.82000000000005s)]
*  environmental protection agency, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Labor [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=316.78s)]
*  added all together. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=321.78s)]
*  But it's gains for these senators. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  I think what's interesting is, in fact, it's routine for the senators to routinely vote [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=326.02s)]
*  mindlessly money for the military industrial complex. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=334.7s)]
*  And the fact that they're with these hiccups right now and they want to do it but they [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=339.29999999999995s)]
*  can't do it is because it's so atrocious what they're being asked to do. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=343.78s)]
*  Something that is a disaster in Ukraine and that is complicity in genocide in the case [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=348.78s)]
*  of the war in Gaza. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=355.38s)]
*  And so it's completely unjustified, this money. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  And yet they're still trying, trying because their normal mode is to vote money for the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  military. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=368.29999999999995s)]
*  And for this to be even a hiccup right now is something different. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  It's because the American people are absolutely against it and because the real purposes of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=373.88s)]
*  this are so awful that there's no justification. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=379.5s)]
*  And interestingly, while there's debate, there's no substantive discussion. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  You don't hear Chuck Schumer who pushes this every day give a speech explaining anything [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=391.38s)]
*  or discussing the context or what's really going on. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=396.42s)]
*  It's mindlessness. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=401.26s)]
*  They just want to vote money for the military and they want to avoid any embarrassment before [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=402.8s)]
*  the November election. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=408.3s)]
*  But there's no substance behind it and that's why they're tripping up right now. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=409.98s)]
*  Moving to the second war, which is the one where financing and arming Israel to carry [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  out in the destruction of Gaza. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=420.64s)]
*  We spoke in November about a month into the war and obviously you were making a lot of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=423.0s)]
*  observations about how atrocious that war was at the time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=427.64s)]
*  We're now four months into the war, three months later. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  Things have gotten cataclysmically and exponentially worse. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=434.08s)]
*  Where do we stand in this war and what now do you think Israel's actual objectives are? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=440.24s)]
*  They're saying this war is going to last for several more months. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=444.32s)]
*  They just rejected Hamas's counter offer for a ceasefire. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=446.84s)]
*  Netanyahu seems intent on continuing this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=450.35999999999996s)]
*  What do you see as the driving motives here? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=453.04s)]
*  Well, I think the key event since we last talked was the ruling of the International [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=456.12s)]
*  Court of Justice, which said that there are plausible grounds that Israel is committing [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=463.88s)]
*  genocide. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=469.76s)]
*  That means, by the way, that America is complicit in a genocide if that's what the ultimate [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=471.68s)]
*  finding is. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=478.6s)]
*  I think that there are good reasons for the court to have made that ruling. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=479.88s)]
*  When you find genocide, it's both a matter of the incredible destruction and cruelty [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=485.52s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  Two million people displaced, around 30,000 dead, 70% of whom are women and children. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=494.48s)]
*  We watched the demolition of universities, of schools, of mosques, of hospitals, of apartment [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=500.88s)]
*  buildings before our eyes with gleeful members of the Israeli Defense Forces. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=507.48s)]
*  The second part of a genocide finding is intent. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=514.08s)]
*  The intent is that the Israeli cabinet doesn't disguise what they want. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=519.04s)]
*  They want the Palestinians gone. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=525.52s)]
*  They want ethnic cleansing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=528.16s)]
*  If it means death because the Palestinians won't leave, so be it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  They don't hide this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=534.64s)]
*  What is amazing, actually, is that since this ICJ ruling, Israel hasn't changed an iota. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=536.12s)]
*  Not a bit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=547.08s)]
*  It continues the killing. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=548.36s)]
*  It continues the slaughter. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  It continues the murder and cold blood. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=552.12s)]
*  And now it says it's going to assault the south of Gaza, where it told the Palestinians [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=554.68s)]
*  to leave for safety. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=560.24s)]
*  The statements by the cabinet have remained absolutely as vile and genocidal as before. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=562.76s)]
*  So they don't even take note. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=571.16s)]
*  Well, maybe we should be a little bit careful. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=573.0s)]
*  Not anything like that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=575.64s)]
*  They had a big event in Tel Aviv, where the settlers are saying, we're going to resettle [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=577.4s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=585.72s)]
*  They have to leave. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  This is greater Israel. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  And there it is before our eyes. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=590.6s)]
*  Today, it's incredible to watch Secretary Blinken. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  He wrings his hands. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=597.6s)]
*  He says, oh, yes, it would be better with a two-state solution. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=599.92s)]
*  That's what the Saudis are telling us and what we know. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  But this is up to the Israelis. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=609.36s)]
*  It's saying as clear as can be, Israel runs American policy. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=612.4s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=619.92s)]
*  Even though we finance them, even though we finance them, it's the most bizarre dynamic. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=621.44s)]
*  I know we provide the munitions. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=627.44s)]
*  We provide the financing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=629.6s)]
*  We're asking for emergency aid. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=630.88s)]
*  And Blinken's saying there's nothing we can do. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=632.64s)]
*  It's all up to the Israelis. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=634.48s)]
*  Well, let me ask you, the one thing that has changed since the ruling is that there was [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=637.04s)]
*  one group doing actual work in delivering basic humanitarian assistance, nowhere near [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=643.12s)]
*  sufficient, but still some to the Gazan population that has been on the brink of starvation and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=649.92s)]
*  now suffers the genuine prospect of mass famine, which was the UN Rescue Aid Agency. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=655.12s)]
*  And Israel just decided to accuse it, having 12 members who participated in October 7th [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=660.8s)]
*  and being linked to Hamas. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=666.8s)]
*  And now the United States and multiple other European countries that have been funding [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=667.92s)]
*  the destruction of Gaza are now saying, we're going to cut off funding to the only aid agency [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=672.64s)]
*  that's actually doing something on a substantive level to keep the people in Gaza from just [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=678.56s)]
*  dying in mass numbers from treatable infections and starvation. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=683.28s)]
*  What do you make of those accusations? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=687.3599999999999s)]
*  Complicity in genocide. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=690.4s)]
*  Even if the accusations were true on their face, and we have not the slightest idea [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=693.3599999999999s)]
*  whether they are, and people that have seen the dossier supposedly say that it's absolutely [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=699.3599999999999s)]
*  absurd, but even if it were true on the face, the reaction to cut off an aid agency at this moment [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=704.4s)]
*  with hundreds of thousands on the brink of starvation is absolutely complicity in a genocide. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know what they think they're getting away with. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=721.6s)]
*  The whole world's eyes are on this. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=725.68s)]
*  There will be a report by South Africa shortly again to the court. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=728.48s)]
*  There's nothing hidden in any of this. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=734.4s)]
*  Of course, it having being held accountable for genocide doesn't stop the genocide by itself, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=738.4s)]
*  but the American leaders are absolutely complicit in this. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=745.44s)]
*  And the senators like Schumer, who just given the money doesn't matter, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=750.16s)]
*  are complicit in this too. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=754.88s)]
*  Doesn't anybody speak a word of honesty anymore? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=756.96s)]
*  This is really the question. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=759.92s)]
*  Kirby, who is the spokesman every day, the one that said that the accusations were completely [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=762.4s)]
*  meritless when South Africa first made the application and then dismissed the court's [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=769.36s)]
*  ruling, brushed it aside in one moment, does not say a word of truth on any day. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=774.16s)]
*  And this is how we are right now. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=780.96s)]
*  Of course, the world's extremely dangerous when it is so miserably governed. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=782.64s)]
*  And when the United States, which is a big military power, is absolutely without decency [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=787.6s)]
*  and limits. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=795.76s)]
*  Well, last question, because I know you have to leave. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=796.56s)]
*  But speaking of being miserably governed and dangerous, the United States, the Biden [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=798.88s)]
*  administration said at the start that their primary objective was to avoid an escalation [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=802.56s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=806.72s)]
*  Obviously, that's failed. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  We are now repeatedly bombing Yemen with no congressional debate or authorization. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=808.72s)]
*  Continuously bombing targets both in Iraq and Syria that we say are linked to Iran. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=812.72s)]
*  We've had three of our own troops killed in a military base in Jordan that very few people [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=817.6s)]
*  knew existed. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=822.56s)]
*  What do you see is the risk of regional escalation now? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=823.6s)]
*  Look, Israel's policy is not even about Hamas. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=827.6s)]
*  Israel's policy explicitly, it's the policy of the cabinet ministers. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=831.52s)]
*  It's their stated intentions every day. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=835.92s)]
*  It is the core of the policy platforms of the parties in power is control over all of [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=838.56s)]
*  Palestine. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=847.36s)]
*  This is not a secret. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=848.32s)]
*  And they want the Palestinians to leave or don't die or something else. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=850.8s)]
*  With that approach, there can be no peace. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=855.2s)]
*  There can be no avoidance of escalation. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=858.48s)]
*  And the United States says, well, it's up to Israel. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=861.76s)]
*  We're just going to keep going along with it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=865.12s)]
*  This is so you can't even understand how pathetic this is. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=868.0s)]
*  The United States, we have some choices, but this administration apparently just says, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=874.72s)]
*  no, they're not our choices. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=880.88s)]
*  They're Israel's choices. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=882.16s)]
*  Well, the choices that Israel makes are absolutely leading to wider and wider war. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=883.52s)]
*  And we know that it's no secret that these religious national extremists in Israel want [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=890.16s)]
*  the United States to go to war with Iran. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=895.44s)]
*  So if that's what Israel wants, is that what we're going to do? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what we're going to find out. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds6vrDY4isY&t=900.4000000000001s)]
