# Inauguration Special: Aaron Mat√©, Michael Tracey & Jenin Younes on Next Trump Admin Hopes & Fears
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU)
*  Alright, we are back. We are joined by two esteemed guests. Janine Eunice, Aaron Mate, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=0.0s)]
*  who you all know and love. Man of the hour, living legend. And Megan is also back. And [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  so we are here in the Sleet at the Spotify pop-up studio. There's lots of music blasting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=21.12s)]
*  around, but now we're going to delve into the real issues of the day. And Aaron, you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=29.04s)]
*  and I were at this event last night. They called it a Peace Bowl. What were some of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=35.68s)]
*  your observations from that event? Like Megan and I were talking just before you got here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  It seems like a pale imitation of like some resistance fervor trying to be replicated [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=46.36s)]
*  now and like no one really cares anymore. You had all these kind of cringe-worthy kind [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=52.32s)]
*  of left-wing kind of platitudes and things. I mean, I don't necessarily begrudge people [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=59.56s)]
*  for holding it or wanting to attend something and maybe wasn't overtly pro-Trump like every [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=65.44s)]
*  other event that's being held in Washington, D.C. But what were some of your observations? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=69.12s)]
*  Then we do have some clips that I want to share with both of you and get your reaction [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=73.64s)]
*  to, but just your broad takes on the state of the resistance. Also, by the way, in the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=76.76s)]
*  New York Times, we talked about earlier today, they were reporting that the woman who actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=81.0s)]
*  knitted the prototype for the original pussy hat in 2017 for the Women's March, even she [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=85.56s)]
*  is so dispirited that she doesn't bother to protest this time around. So I guess what [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=93.04s)]
*  does it tell you about the resistance or lack thereof? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Taking this back to 2017 and the first day of Trump's administration, the resistance [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=104.48s)]
*  embodied by the Women's March and the parallel rallies at the airports against the Muslim [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  ban. What explains how all that is dissipated? Well, I mean, again, I'm very influenced and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=115.2s)]
*  biased by the issues I've focused on. So one of them, of course, is Russiagate. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=121.68s)]
*  Really? I hadn't heard of that. Which I think killed everything. How could it not? When [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=125.72s)]
*  you channel resistance to Trump and all the legitimate ways to oppose him into a dumb [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=132.72s)]
*  conspiracy theory and your savior figures become people like MSNBC pundits screaming [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=138.56s)]
*  about Russia every night and Robert Mueller, John Brennan, John Brennan and enrolling people [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=145.56s)]
*  in further in a neocon orthodoxy and just, you know, reducing resistance to watching [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=152.56s)]
*  cable news and hoping that Robert Mueller is going to issue the long awaited indictments [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=157.28s)]
*  for Russia conspiracy. So I think that killed it right there. And then now you have, I mean, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=161.56s)]
*  fast forwarding to today, although in that time, that sort of cemented this like faith [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=166.32s)]
*  in institutions. That was like the mantra constantly. The institutions were going to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=172.32s)]
*  hold Trump to account. And by that, they meant the courts. They meant special prosecutors [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=176.28s)]
*  after Robert Mueller. It was Jack Smith hoping for all these various legal cases against [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=181.64s)]
*  Trump, the classified documents that now nobody cares about the hush money case. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=186.88s)]
*  They resurrected the espionage act to charge Trump and now nobody cares. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=191.32s)]
*  And the various scams, the lie about Hunter Biden's laptop being from Russia, the Russian [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=197.88s)]
*  bounties in Afghanistan. So a combination of outright scams and conspiracy theories, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  most of them tied to Russia fantasies. And then this belief in law, this like developed [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=210.4s)]
*  belief in lawfare. And of course it's going to show for nothing. And so now Trump is coming [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=215.6s)]
*  back in. So no wonder people are feeling deflated. And then you have the Gaza genocide, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=219.92s)]
*  as I call it. I know not everyone describes it that way, but and that certainly split [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  the Democratic base. A lot of people who supported the Democrats and were able to oversee some [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  of their other missteps, including on Russia gate, were very let down by Biden's policy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  and the failures of the Democrats to hold him to account and the failure of Kamala Harris [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  to chart a different course. So those are the main factors that I see right now instead [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  of the deflation. Yeah. Among many in the deflation of the resistance. And last night [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  at this peace ball, you know, I, I, I saw a lot of very commendable statements, people [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=257.36s)]
*  outraged by Gaza and feeling betrayed by that. But even there, and even in that movement, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=265.32s)]
*  you have areas where I just have my disagreements that I think made a real movement impossible [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=270.96s)]
*  . For example, you had these progressive lawmakers last night who have taken a lot [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=277.24s)]
*  of heat for their brave stances on Gaza. Rashida to leave Corey Bush. Jim McGovern was there [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=281.6s)]
*  as well. But what do they do when it comes to voting for the Ukraine proxy war, enriching [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=287.48s)]
*  the very military industrial complex that last night they were talking about fighting. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=292.6s)]
*  They all voted yes every single time in lockstep. And I blame Russia gate in part for that because [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=296.72s)]
*  Let me just stop you there because I have to play this clip. Okay. Yeah. And excuse me, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  Janine for passing you over on that question. We'll get to you. I promise on that same issue. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=308.04s)]
*  But we want everyone to react. But this is like one of the most unbelievable interviews [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=311.72s)]
*  I think I've ever conducted. Okay. So Corey Bush is out of Congress now as of January [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=317.0s)]
*  3rd. She lost her democratic primary in Missouri to Wesley Bell, who was funded by a pack and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=322.88s)]
*  pro-Israel lobbying groups. And she was pilloried for calling for a ceasefire very early. A pack [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  spent over eight million dollars. Yeah. So her and Jamal Bowman were the two main democratic [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  incumbents who were ousted. And what was most cynical about those primary campaigns is that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=341.08s)]
*  the pro-Israel funders would air ads in the districts of the Congress people that often [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  had nothing at all to do with Israel. They would claim like she wasn't loyal enough to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  supporting President Biden's infrastructure plan and stuff. Yeah. When obviously they didn't [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=357.36s)]
*  give a shit about infrastructure. But anyway, so you got to hear this because I asked her about [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=362.32s)]
*  this very issue that you raised about the handful of Democrats in Congress who have been critical [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=367.68s)]
*  of the Israel policy having this incredible blind spot for Ukraine policy. So I've never heard. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=374.48s)]
*  Being progressives who are supposed to stand for funding social programs and not funding wars. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=381.2s)]
*  That's like the bedrock of being a progressive. But yet we couldn't find one to vote once against [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  the Ukraine proxy. Literally not one. Not one. Democrats were 100 percent united in voting for [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=392.64s)]
*  those appropriations packages around Ukraine. OK, so let's listen to this and we're going to splice [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  it in an editing so people can hear about. I'm just going to play it on my computer for now. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  You mentioned in your speech earlier at this event that we're at the Peace Ball. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=407.76s)]
*  We want to basically advocating for a general movement of peace. I'm wondering how you relate [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  that to the issue of Ukraine because it seems like the Democrats in Congress were virtually [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=416.0s)]
*  united, actually 100 percent united in funding Ukraine, which whether you like it or not, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=420.88s)]
*  that does involve sending a giant amount of munitions and weapons and armaments into a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=426.32s)]
*  hugely destructive war where you have hundreds of thousands of casualties, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=430.88s)]
*  Russians and Ukrainians piling up in the battlefield. And the only criticism was coming [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=434.88s)]
*  from a section of Republicans. So is there any little any contradiction, do you think, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=441.6s)]
*  in terms of you calling for peace or Democrats calling for peace and not being able, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=447.12s)]
*  not being willing to at all reevaluate the policy on Ukraine, which has really been extremely [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=450.56s)]
*  catastrophic? It's it's some of the most brutal warfare since World War One, like 100 years ago. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=455.36s)]
*  And Democrats, from my perspective, just to be honest with you, have been very missing in action [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=461.68s)]
*  in kind of critically evaluating that policy and just going along with it, whatever the Biden [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  Harris administration wanted in terms of weapons. Really, what about diplomacy? What about some other [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=471.44s)]
*  option rather than just dumping endless weapons into into Ukraine? Is that fair? Do you think? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=475.68s)]
*  I think the other part of that, though, is the threat of U.S. troops by the masses moving to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=482.0s)]
*  the ground was a very real thing. At least that's how it was presented. It had been presented to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=495.44s)]
*  us in Congress and for me presented by who? Presented by the administration that, you know, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=501.28s)]
*  that that would be a very real thing. You know, so our work. So did we want to keep U.S. troops [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=508.23999999999995s)]
*  from having to go to Ukraine? You know, so that was that that was the thing that people were weighing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=514.88s)]
*  So the White House presented, just to clarify, the White House, the Biden White House presented the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=520.56s)]
*  issue to you as if you don't supply the weapons that they say are required, that could that could [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=524.4s)]
*  involve that that might mean that U.S. troops would have to go into the combat? If we don't, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=529.6s)]
*  not not saying that if we don't supply the weapons, it was if if you all don't support, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  if you all don't support these bills, then that could be the outcome. And so for many, and I can't [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=539.6s)]
*  speak for everyone, but the question when I look at my own district, when I look at my own district [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  and I think about those who who often are the ones who end up with the least amount of help, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=552.0s)]
*  the least amount of services often don't have what they need when they return back. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=559.76s)]
*  I wanted to support my my community in that. So that's what that was about, making sure that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  we weren't sending the same black and brown bodies to go and do this bidding [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=572.24s)]
*  and then using using the money and the resources to go and do that. I can't speak for everyone, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  but I know that that was what some people that was some people were thinking. And so I can't, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  like I said, I can't speak for everyone. I didn't have those conversations, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  but that was just a very real thing. So I want to clarify one thing. Sorry, I forgot to put my [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  microphone in my face. Your thinking at the time, you know, when these appropriations bills came [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  forward in terms of arms for Ukraine was that by approving arms for Ukraine, you were lessening [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=604.48s)]
*  the likelihood that as you put it, black and brown soldiers or people that had joined the military [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=610.16s)]
*  would end up getting deployed to Ukraine. So that's how the administration framed it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=616.16s)]
*  So I assume they offer through no fault of your own. You're not somebody who spent a whole lot [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=620.64s)]
*  of time probably focused on the issue of Ukraine over the course of your career. You have other [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=623.68s)]
*  interests mostly. Right. And so they presented it to you or your interpretation was that by [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=628.0s)]
*  providing those munitions, you were basically saving or no. Okay. So no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=635.2s)]
*  it wasn't providing munitions. It was supporting these bills, supporting these bills to, to hold [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=642.24s)]
*  off Russia, supporting these bills. Was there funding for funding for all for ammunition? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=651.52s)]
*  It was for what the funding was for. This was a way to stop us from sending US troops who, for me, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=658.4s)]
*  what I was already dealing with in my district were mostly black and brown and marginalized [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=667.6s)]
*  folks that we were trying to help. It was to stop that from being, from being the next occurrence. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=672.16s)]
*  That's what that was. Those bills provided munitions. But with the, I've given you a lot of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=679.04s)]
*  time, a lot of time. And so, you know, and for you to turn this into a Ukraine thing was not, you know, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=684.48s)]
*  so I, you know, I'm trying to answer your question. I'm trying to be, I thought I was trying, I'm [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=689.76s)]
*  trying to be respectful, honestly. I just thought that Ukraine was relevant given that we're at the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=694.56s)]
*  peace ball. That's another conflict going on. You don't think so? No, no, no, no, absolutely. I just, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=698.4s)]
*  what I'm saying is, is that I, you keep like going, asking question after question after question. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=702.72s)]
*  I only answer two questions with everybody else. I gave you like what, six? That's fine. Yeah. So, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=711.28s)]
*  you know. All right. Well, I appreciate it the way I didn't mean to be rude at all. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=715.76s)]
*  You weren't being rude. You took the opportunity to just, I did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=720.48s)]
*  Anyone would do. I get, I get, I'm just saying I just, okay. Yeah. All right. Well, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=727.04s)]
*  I don't want to speak for other people about, cause I haven't had those conversations. So yeah. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=731.36s)]
*  All right. Well, uh, former Congress, Cory Bush of Missouri. Thank you. All right. Thank you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=736.4s)]
*  Thank you. All right. So, uh, Aaron, that might be the favorite, my favorite of you [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  her argument. I never heard this before. Have you that voting for Ukraine funding was presented [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  to her or at least she interpreted the case that was being made by the Biden administration as [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=756.72s)]
*  by voting for these appropriations bills, which she seemed not even to be totally clear, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=762.1600000000001s)]
*  included funding for munitions. Cause remember people like Cory Bush are never even asked about [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=767.28s)]
*  Ukraine. Exactly. They're asked about you, Israel, a fair amount because they have a position that is [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=772.32s)]
*  going against the grain somewhat, but on Ukraine, like it's just exempt from any scrutiny. Whereas [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=776.88s)]
*  Republicans are asked about it all the time to like probe the fishers within the Republican [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=783.2s)]
*  coalition. Um, but she's saying that she voted for those Ukraine funding bills to protect [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=786.88s)]
*  black and brown bodies in St. Louis. First of all, I want to say, I have a lot of admiration for [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=794.08s)]
*  Cory Bush. I do. She's a first term Congress member. She gets targeted by AIPAC. She's already [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=801.12s)]
*  under a lot of pressure, you know, coming from a working class background, being a black woman, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=806.32s)]
*  being a progressive, there's all these forces aligned against her. So her position on Ukraine, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=810.48s)]
*  I don't even fault her for it, but I do blame the progressive leadership in Congress who [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=815.04s)]
*  basically forced someone like her into a position where if they were to take a different stance to [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  vote against all this money for Ukraine proxy war, they'd be even more vulnerable and, uh, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=825.52s)]
*  and targeted. And I understand why someone in their position would have a hard time doing that, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=832.64s)]
*  but the answer she's giving to you just make no sense. First of all, if it's true what she's [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=836.8s)]
*  saying that the administration said that, you know, if we don't get this money for the Ukraine [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=841.76s)]
*  proxy war, then we might see a situation where our own forces have to fight. Then basically [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=845.8399999999999s)]
*  that shows the Biden ministry, if it's true, the Biden administration said that then the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=851.92s)]
*  Biden administration would have committed a pretty big lie because the Biden administration always said [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=854.9599999999999s)]
*  we're not going to send troops to Ukraine no matter what. So they wrote, so if they were using that [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=860.16s)]
*  as sort of like blackmail behind the scenes, and it's a big if by the way, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=864.08s)]
*  I don't want to take what she said there as like on faith as like that was like a threat issued by [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=869.6s)]
*  Biden, but it's quite possible that they did regardless if that's what they did, it's incredibly [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=874.8s)]
*  cynical because they weren't going to send troops to fight in Ukraine. That was never an option. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=879.28s)]
*  The whole point of the Ukraine proxy war, the whole reason to prolong it was to use Ukraine [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=883.52s)]
*  to bleed Russia. That's what Jake Sullivan acknowledged. That's what Lloyd Austin [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=888.24s)]
*  acknowledged. Everybody knows now that that was the aim. So this threat that we might have to send [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=891.76s)]
*  troops one day. And then if the Biden administration did threaten that, and Cori Bush buys that, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=896.56s)]
*  it's just ridiculous because what you should do in that situation is call their bluff [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=901.76s)]
*  and say, I'm sorry, like you're not going to blackmail American taxpayers by threatening to [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=906.8s)]
*  send our own troops into this disastrous war that nobody wants and that could have been avoided. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  But Aaron, I think it's probably fair to say that she just does not have a foundation of knowledge [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=916.48s)]
*  of course, which she could have drawn to call the bluff. So she's just taking the cues from [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=920.72s)]
*  the people who are briefing her. It's not like when she was like an activist in Ferguson or [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=925.0400000000001s)]
*  whatever, she was spending a lot of time thinking about Ukraine. A hundred percent. And that's where [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=929.6s)]
*  I felt people like Pramila Jayapal and Bernie Sanders, every other progressive leader in Congress [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=933.28s)]
*  who's been there for a lot longer than Cori Bush, who knew exactly what was up, who knew there [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=939.76s)]
*  wasn't a threat of the U.S. going off to war, but still then allowed to basically told everyone to [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=944.08s)]
*  go along with funding it, spending well over a hundred billion dollars to prolong a proxy war [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=950.0s)]
*  that could have been avoided before Russia invaded and certainly afterwards when there were peace [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=954.96s)]
*  talks. And amazingly, this is forgotten, but there was a 24 hour period where people like Cori Bush, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=958.88s)]
*  after voting for all these multi-billion dollar bills, signed on to a letter calling for diplomacy. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=965.2s)]
*  But after a little freak out online from neoconservatives. This was the progressive [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=970.8s)]
*  caucus letter. Yes. That they repudiated. They withdrew it. They all, and they apologized for [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=975.84s)]
*  daring to call for diplomacy and using the overwhelming U.S. leverage. And then Cori Bush [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=982.08s)]
*  says that, you know, so to protect black and brown bodies and to, you know, be able to care for them. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=987.44s)]
*  That to me is the most cynical part. I don't know if she's being consciously cynical, but to invoke [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=993.2s)]
*  this like nomenclature of black and brown bodies to try to provide some bizarre extraneous [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=997.52s)]
*  justification for supporting, you know, more funding. I mean, that's almost a parody of like [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1002.8s)]
*  left-wing lingo being deployed in whatever circumstances seen as necessary at the moment. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1007.52s)]
*  Especially when all that money that was spent on this horrible war could have actually served [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1013.92s)]
*  marginalized communities. That's the whole point. That's what I thought being a progressive is about [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1018.24s)]
*  is not supporting foreign conflicts, at least those that are unnecessary like this one and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1022.4799999999999s)]
*  destructive and instead spending on social welfare at home. And had progressives taken up that mantle, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1028.48s)]
*  they could have provided an alternative to the Republicans who opposed the Ukraine proxy war [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1034.96s)]
*  money. And I think benefited from that electorally because there was a significant percentage of the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1039.76s)]
*  population that also didn't want to see all this money spent fueling conflict abroad. So it's sad [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1044.64s)]
*  for me to hear someone like Cori Bush, who I think is a genuine advocate of peace, of social justice, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1049.68s)]
*  all these noble things, being intimidated into going along with it and then coming up with the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1055.44s)]
*  type of really questionable rationale that we just heard. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1062.24s)]
*  Janine, do you have a thought on that? Because Cori Bush really was very much out front calling [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1066.08s)]
*  for a ceasefire early on. I think it was either maybe even October of 2023 in Israel. There's a [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1073.52s)]
*  lot of activist pressure applied to her and other Democrats around the Israel issue. And [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1080.08s)]
*  yet there's another major conflict that's been roiling the world and the U.S. political system [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1087.6s)]
*  for even longer than the post-October 7th conflict in the Nile. And she just doesn't have a cogent [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1093.52s)]
*  thing to say about it at all, despite having voted for every appropriations bill funding U.S. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1099.12s)]
*  provisions in Ukraine. So what do you make of that dynamic? Sometimes I feel like I'm the only [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1105.52s)]
*  journalist who ever asked these people about this issue, really. Yes, you are. On both sides. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1109.84s)]
*  It's bizarre. I mean, I think she's kind of emblematic of a lot of Democrats who have what [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1114.48s)]
*  I would call the right position on Israel-Gaza, because in a way that's more obvious. You're [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1120.24s)]
*  talking about people who've been under occupation and siege in Gaza for many years, decades, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1124.24s)]
*  and are now being bombed, genocide committed against them. So it's kind of easier to be on [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1129.2800000000002s)]
*  the right side of that one. But I think a lot of progressives don't quite understand what the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1136.0s)]
*  correct stance is. Not that there's only one correct stance, but the real issues. And I use [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1140.4s)]
*  my mother as an example all the time, because she's very smart, but she sort of reads the New York [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1145.92s)]
*  Times and takes everything they say at face value. She doesn't look behind that. And she thinks we [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1149.5200000000002s)]
*  should definitely be in Ukraine. And that's sort of the agenda that's being pushed by the progressive [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1154.32s)]
*  left and the left-wing media at this point. And I think a lot of people don't really look behind [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1159.2s)]
*  that as obviously Cory Bush did. And this is where I fault, by the way, progressive media, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1162.24s)]
*  where people like Cory Bush go, which is their base of support. And whatever- [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1167.76s)]
*  Give us some examples, like Democracy Now. Like my former home, Democracy Now, which, again, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1173.9199999999998s)]
*  they represent a type of progressive media outlet that after the Russian invasion forgot all the [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1180.3999999999999s)]
*  reporting they did for years. And I was a part of when I used to work there on the role of NATO [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1186.08s)]
*  in Ukraine and the coup of 2014 and the Minsk Accords. All this context that is so important [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1192.08s)]
*  to understanding that Russia's invasion, whatever you think of it, and you don't have to justify it [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  to just recognize all the factors in which there was a provocation and this could have been [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1204.8s)]
*  resolved peacefully. And certainly the answer was not necessarily to flood Ukraine with billions of [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1209.36s)]
*  dollars worth of weapons and obstruct the peace talks that began between Ukraine and Russia [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1214.3999999999999s)]
*  immediately. And shows like Democracy Now sadly forgot all this and bought into a lot of the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1218.4799999999998s)]
*  proxy war. And then when progressives like Cory Bush would come on, would never challenge them on, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1224.24s)]
*  hey, why are you voting to authorize tens of billions of dollars in warfarin? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, I think part of what happened was Russia also became the bad guy during the Trump [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  administration and a lot of progressives sort of bought into that. Trump and Russia were [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1236.8s)]
*  one. And so I think that sort of fit into the narrative and convinced a lot of progressives [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1240.8s)]
*  that being in Ukraine was the right thing. Russia criminalized diplomacy with Russia. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1246.56s)]
*  Ukraine did. Sorry, Russia criminalized diplomacy. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1251.84s)]
*  And Ukraine literally passed like a presidential order. Yes, to rule it out. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1255.52s)]
*  And they enacted an order prohibiting any diplomacy with. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1260.48s)]
*  But the ideological and narrative foundations for that was Russiagate where all of a sudden, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1265.04s)]
*  in the liberal mind and many progressive minds too, Trump and Russia became synonymous. So [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1271.2s)]
*  everything bad about Trump was then the fault of Russia and therefore dealing with Russia was [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1275.76s)]
*  therefore treason. And that helps set the stage for the Ukraine war. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1279.76s)]
*  Yeah. And they also created this kind of superstructural narrative about how Russia [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  was responsible for any emergence of like dangerous right wing populism anywhere in the [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1286.96s)]
*  world. Hillary Clinton famously gave a speech in August of 2016 where she kind of introduced this [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1292.32s)]
*  theory. And the exact quote to the best of my recollection was she called Putin the grand [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1300.08s)]
*  godfather of global extremism. I think she went to miss spoken, but she ended up saying grand [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1307.04s)]
*  godfather of global right wing extremism. And that carried forth ever since where Putin was [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1312.24s)]
*  responsible for Le Pen in France and whoever. And there might be some kind of conversions of [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1320.4s)]
*  interests here and there, but it was always really overstated in terms of the direct proximate, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1327.2s)]
*  causal relationship that he would have with any of these incredibly disparate movements anywhere [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1332.72s)]
*  in the world. Like remember Putin was blamed for the trucker protests against Canada. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1336.8s)]
*  Yes. So it goes on and on and on. But as far as the incoming Trump administration though, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1340.8s)]
*  I wanted to play just a quick brief clip and Jenny and I promise we will get to the Israel thing [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1346.72s)]
*  soon. But I want to play a brief clip. Here's Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary nominee. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1351.52s)]
*  Yes. I don't know if you saw this. He had his confirmation hearing this past week [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1357.04s)]
*  and he's being questioned by Senator Mark Warner and the issue of Ukraine comes up. So I just want [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1362.24s)]
*  to have this be like a window into what policy continuity or divergence might be on the offing [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1369.2s)]
*  as the Trump administration comes in. I believe that the sanctions regime, especially, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1375.76s)]
*  first of all, I would say in my adult life that the tragedy going on in Ukraine is one of the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1384.16s)]
*  greatest tragedies of my adult life and ending that as soon as possible, an entering role that [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1393.2s)]
*  Treasury can play in that if confirmed, I would like to do. As we discussed, I believe that the [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1401.92s)]
*  sanctions were not fulsome enough. I believe that the previous administration was worried about [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1410.16s)]
*  raising U.S. energy prices during an election season and I am [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1422.72s)]
*  perplexed to see that National Security Adviser Sullivan on his way out the door [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  is raising the sanctions level on Russian oil companies and indeed the oil prices in the U.S. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1440.64s)]
*  are up about 9% this month. So what was good for that administration is being foisted on us, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1449.04s)]
*  but having gone from, I think, low-level sanctions to mid-level that if any officials [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1457.52s)]
*  in the Russian Federation are watching this confirmation hearing, they should know that if [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1466.72s)]
*  I'm confirmed and if President Trump requests and as part of his strategy to end the Ukraine War [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1472.0s)]
*  that I will be 100% on board for taking sanctions up, especially on the Russian oil majors, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1480.72s)]
*  to levels that would bring the Russian Federation to the table. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1487.84s)]
*  And I will only take 30 seconds. Let me just get 30 seconds. Thank you for that because I think [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1494.48s)]
*  it's important that we don't take these tools out of the toolkit. We can litigate what the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1498.64s)]
*  past administration did and when they did it, but increasing pressure on Putin to bring about a [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1504.88s)]
*  resolution, I very much appreciate your willingness and I hope you will be an advocate for keeping [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1510.3200000000002s)]
*  those sanctions on and actually advancing them even further. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1515.68s)]
*  Senator Warner. Okay, so Aaron, that's the incoming Treasury Secretary criticizing the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1519.3600000000001s)]
*  Biden administration for not applying severe enough sanctions to Russia and saying that the [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1527.12s)]
*  incoming Trump administration, they'll be less reluctant to actually hit them where it hurts by [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1532.4799999999998s)]
*  ramping up sanctions on the Russian state oil companies. Actually, this has been something [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1538.6399999999999s)]
*  that's been proposed in Trump circles or Trump adjacent circles for a while now as to how his [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1543.76s)]
*  policy approach would differ. And something that really bugged me over the course of this 2024 [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1548.4799999999998s)]
*  campaign was that when Trump would talk about the issue of Ukraine-Russia, he would usually [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1552.8s)]
*  say something like the war never would have happened. Had he been in power, he'll solve the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1557.6s)]
*  war as president-elect, which we have now less than 24 hours, I guess, for him to do that. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1562.72s)]
*  So we'll have to wait and see what happens by noon. But there was very little specific sussed out. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1567.84s)]
*  And this is the incoming Treasury Secretary, and this has been echoed by others, saying that they [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1574.0s)]
*  want to actually increase the bellicosity with Russia, and somehow that's going to give the US [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1578.24s)]
*  enough leverage to force Putin to capitulate or to submit to US demands. So I don't know, do you [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1583.36s)]
*  feel like this stuff wasn't fully fleshed out enough during the campaign, or what is your reaction? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1590.16s)]
*  Well, that narrative contradiction that you identified where everyone assumed Trump was [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1594.48s)]
*  going to be accommodating with Russia, soft on Russia, however you want to put it, and then [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1599.28s)]
*  there was zero policy evidence for it. In fact, all the evidence went in the other direction, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1603.76s)]
*  because in Trump's first term, he did impose massive sanctions on Russia. He did tear up [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1608.64s)]
*  a really important nuclear arms treaty, which no one talks about, but puts the planet at peril, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1614.16s)]
*  the INF Treaty, which Trump destroyed, but everybody ignored it because it undermined [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1619.68s)]
*  the prevailing narrative that he secretly was doing Russia's bidding. And now- [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1624.48s)]
*  And by the way, with the tearing up of the INF Treaty, Russia developed the new intermediate [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1630.16s)]
*  range ballistic missiles that it just showcased for the first time two months ago or so when it [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1636.16s)]
*  launched that really extravagant attack as kind of a demonstrative attack on a Ukraine, I think, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1643.76s)]
*  arms production facility. Yes, and restoring that treaty was at the center of the proposal Russia [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1648.96s)]
*  put out in late 2021 as part of its offer to avoid invading its take or leave it off. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1654.0s)]
*  One of its key goals was to restore the provisions of the INF Treaty. So Trump played a major role [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1661.76s)]
*  in fueling the conflict that then led to Russia's invasion. But he has said still recently some [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1667.36s)]
*  things that I do think are a departure from everybody else. He's talked about how there [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1674.8s)]
*  does have to be a peace deal that recognizes Russian concerns. He's empathetic with Russia's [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1679.28s)]
*  hostility towards NATO encroachment on its borders. And he said that if he were president, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  he wouldn't have authorized what Biden recently did, which was letting Ukraine use long-range [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1690.48s)]
*  missiles to strike into Russia. So Trump has said a few things recently that if he falls through on [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1695.3600000000001s)]
*  them would be a stark departure. But as you point out, people around him don't have that position, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1701.04s)]
*  including this Treasury Secretary. And his record in office was to be a hawk. Now, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1706.88s)]
*  the one thing though, another argument for thinking why maybe he will go in a different [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1713.0400000000002s)]
*  direction now towards peace is that the tech oligarchs around him, they do want friendly [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1718.5600000000002s)]
*  relations with Russia. Elon Musk, others, they've been critics of this proxy work for a while. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1723.5200000000002s)]
*  And just, you know, whereas in the first term, Trump wanted to get in with like [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1729.1200000000001s)]
*  the neocons of DC. That's why he appointed all of them like John Bolton. Now he's got people like [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1732.8000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk in his ear. And he does to me be like, but he's got Mike Walz and Margarubia. Yeah. But [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1737.92s)]
*  if you compare the relative power there, who was more power, Elon Musk or Mike Walz? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1745.92s)]
*  Let me say something on this because I, and this gets into the Gaza dispute. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1748.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. We let's make the transition. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1752.4s)]
*  I do think Trump 2.0 is going to be very different from Trump 1.0. And I say this [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1753.76s)]
*  to someone who cried when Hillary Clinton lost the election. I've had a bit of a [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1757.6000000000001s)]
*  why I never humiliated myself. I actually, well, I was, you know, I was sitting next to Mike Tracy. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1761.12s)]
*  But I, at first he's, he's said a lot of things and he said a lot of things during his campaign [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1768.4799999999998s)]
*  that troubled me. And he appointed a lot of people when it, especially when it comes to [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1773.6s)]
*  Israel, Palestine, who troubled me, but he has immediately gotten out and brokered a ceasefire [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1776.2399999999998s)]
*  deal that Biden didn't bother to in 15 months. And I think he may be playing 40 chess to an extent. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1780.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, maybe he's not that smart, but maybe he is. And he's a businessman. I don't [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1786.8s)]
*  think he likes war. I've recently watched some clips of him from the Iraq war era where he [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1790.32s)]
*  expressed real distress about the veterans coming home, amputated about the Iraqi people. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1794.6399999999999s)]
*  Now he's not beholden to any of the interests that he initially was, you know, in order to get [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  reelected. So I think we're going to see something very different. And I, I think he may be trying [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1804.72s)]
*  to please some of his donors by putting in place some of these people who are hawks, but I think [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1808.56s)]
*  we're going to see something really different. I mean, he might disappoint me. Maybe we'll be [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1813.28s)]
*  sitting here in two months and I'll eat my words. But the fact that the first thing he did before [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1817.2s)]
*  he even took office was broker the ceasefire deal, which is very good for the Palestinians who are [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1821.28s)]
*  dancing with joy in the streets. I bought my dad a mega hat as a joke because he's so happy with [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1825.76s)]
*  Trump. Okay. So this, this even in the Marco Rubio Rubio confirmation hearings, he said, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1830.64s)]
*  we want to end the dying in Ukraine kind of echoing Trump's words. Apparently he said that [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1837.6000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine would have to make concessions. So I think it even Marco Rubio, maybe there could be a change [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1842.32s)]
*  there. Maybe he could be less hot fish. But we'll see. I mean, ultimately they're all beholden to the president, right? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1846.96s)]
*  They're his, so they can't, you know, Trump has to okay, whatever they do. I guess, you know, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1850.8s)]
*  my point about Rubio is that if you compare the incoming second Trump administration to the [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1856.48s)]
*  first Trump administration, the secretary of state is much more ideologically neocon. If you want to [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1862.16s)]
*  use that term in the second administration than the first Rex Tillerson was kind of like an [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1867.6000000000001s)]
*  apolitical. That's true. Yeah, that's true. Exxon Mobil CEO who wanted to talk to Russia. Yeah, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1871.6000000000001s)]
*  exactly. Whereas Marco Rubio and not only I kind of have advocated for jettisoning the term neocons, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1876.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it obscures more than it reveals at this point. It's just like anybody with, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1881.84s)]
*  with foreign policy views who I don't like is like therefore a neocon. So whatever terminology we [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1885.44s)]
*  might use, Marco Rubio has a much more robust record of favoring really hardcore interventionist [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1890.32s)]
*  policy measures than the first incoming secretary of state did. Now Pompeo is much more in accord [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1898.3999999999999s)]
*  with Rubio than he was with Tillerson. But that's why there seems to be me to be more continuity. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1904.64s)]
*  And Trump made a lot of these kind of gestures toward disliking war. And he, he, part of the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1910.4s)]
*  reason why I think he won in 2016 was because he was calling out like the trillions of dollars [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1917.68s)]
*  that have been spent in the Middle East. Yes. And then a lot of those expenditures were never [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1922.0s)]
*  really reinvested in the United States. As he advocated, he actually escalated in Afghanistan, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1926.64s)]
*  which people don't know or maybe never remember or never knew in the first place. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1931.92s)]
*  He had a record number of bombs dropped in Afghanistan in the year 2018 and 2019. And we're [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1936.8000000000002s)]
*  told that Trump is like somehow opposed to the military industrial complexes of the military [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1943.76s)]
*  industrial complex was really unhappy with having to produce the munitions to drop at record rates [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1948.64s)]
*  in Afghanistan. So I grant there are some like rhetorical gestures that he makes, but on the [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1954.48s)]
*  issue of Gaza, okay, I've been told that I need to repent and apologize. I guess you a formal apology [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1960.08s)]
*  for just like covering the campaign when Trump was basically attached at the hip with Marian [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1967.52s)]
*  Adelson. Yes, it still is. It still is. Marian Adelson is something like floating around DC [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1973.12s)]
*  somewhere. She was at the Peter Thiel party last night with Don Jr. and Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1977.76s)]
*  She's hosting her own event with Zuckerberg. The Adelson-Zuckerberg dynamic duo [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1982.96s)]
*  is hosting their own party tomorrow, which maybe we'll be able to sneak into. I'll wear a false [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1989.92s)]
*  mustache. I want to go. And Trump explicitly campaigned against the ceasefire. He and the [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=1994.16s)]
*  Republicans were basically universal in denouncing Biden for somehow being in Haq to Hamas or [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2002.5600000000002s)]
*  pandering to anti-Semites, not being sufficiently pliant to Israel in provisioning weaponry. And I'm [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2008.72s)]
*  sorry, Israel calibrates its policy action very acutely to political dynamics in the United States, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2015.92s)]
*  especially Netanyahu, who's basically an American. He lived in Pennsylvania. He knows all the players [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2024.3200000000002s)]
*  involved. So for the entirety of 2024, Netanyahu was able to kind of triangulate against the Biden [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2029.92s)]
*  administration. Now, the Biden administration didn't impose leverage to any substantial degree. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2037.76s)]
*  However, there was still a political opening that Netanyahu could exploit, knowing that there was a [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2043.04s)]
*  campaign season underway. Trump was probably favored to win for the entirety of the year. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2049.2s)]
*  And so therefore, he could use the fact that the one entire party was explicitly against any [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2054.24s)]
*  cessation of hostilities in Israel and actually wanted them to expand. Jared Kushner said, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2060.64s)]
*  Israel should invade Lebanon. And then the next day they do it. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2067.36s)]
*  Well, Trump. So should I have not covered that? Like, what's the alternative here? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2070.72s)]
*  No, but the tweet I took issue with was you said in November that the imams, you made fun of the [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2075.12s)]
*  imams who voted for Trump and said, are they so happy now with a laughing emoji? And I said- [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  About the appointments. About Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2087.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, about the appointments. And I said the appointments alone don't mean anything for [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2089.68s)]
*  Palestinians on the ground. Let's see what happens and withhold judgment. And you said it was absurd [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2092.08s)]
*  for me to say withhold judgment. So I just wanted to make that- [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2096.96s)]
*  I said withhold judgment about the nature of the appointees. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2099.84s)]
*  No, but I said that. But the whole point was that doesn't necessarily mean anything for [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2102.88s)]
*  Palestinians on the ground. If ultimately Trump drives the policy and not the appointees policy, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2106.96s)]
*  then it doesn't really matter in the end. I mean, he may have had to satisfy his donors. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2113.28s)]
*  In fact, I think he had to do this to get elected. And if that's what he had to do, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2118.56s)]
*  and then he knew all along he was going to broker a ceasefire deal, which I had some [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2122.08s)]
*  various reasons for believing he would, then good for him. He did what he had to do. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2125.84s)]
*  I will admit that that particular tweet, it was maybe a bit flippant. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2129.1200000000003s)]
*  I'll repudiate that individual tweet, but I don't repudiate my entire- [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2133.44s)]
*  I wear a flippant tweet. I wear a flippant tweet. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2136.96s)]
*  I don't repudiate the broad thrust of my coverage. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2138.6400000000003s)]
*  No, but in terms of what did Trump actually do here, it is true beyond even Israeli sources [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2143.04s)]
*  who might have a stake in puffing up Trump and making him look good. Other sources, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2149.6800000000003s)]
*  Gulf States, even I think some American sources who have said that Trump's [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2155.2s)]
*  hard line with Netanyahu did leave Netanyahu no choice. I don't know exactly what Trump's [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2160.3199999999997s)]
*  envoy said. Certainly didn't threaten to cut off weapons. So what leverage did they actually use? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2165.04s)]
*  Right. And that's the one- [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2168.7999999999997s)]
*  But I don't think they did. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2169.68s)]
*  I don't think they- No, I don't- [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2170.72s)]
*  I think they did. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2171.9199999999996s)]
*  And that's the one point of leverage that Biden could have employed and never really did, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2172.7999999999997s)]
*  except for the one kind of minor thing where they claim that they were delaying the 2,000 pound [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2176.56s)]
*  bombs for a couple of weeks and then sent them anyway. So my question is what leverage did Trump [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2181.68s)]
*  by way of his envoy, Steve Witkoff, exert that Biden didn't? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2188.64s)]
*  I think it had to be. He said he'd cut off the weapons. That's all I can think of. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2193.7599999999998s)]
*  Do we have any evidence for that? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2196.24s)]
*  No, just what else would it be? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2197.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. There's an account in The Washington Post that basically said [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2199.12s)]
*  it doesn't say that there was a threat to cut off weapons, that the message was delivered, that [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2202.16s)]
*  if you don't reach the ceasefire now, we're not going to be with you. That was basically the threat. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2205.7599999999998s)]
*  So it was a more general- [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2210.3999999999996s)]
*  It was a more general thing. And there was also, and people, especially on the left, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2211.28s)]
*  make a lot of this, there was the tweet that Trump, or the truth that Trump shared. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2215.28s)]
*  I'm sorry, of Jeffrey Sachs, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, criticizing Netanyahu and saying that [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2219.6800000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu is basically the source of all US wars in the Middle East. And people make a lot of that [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2226.32s)]
*  because Trump did share that. And it's a very powerful clip from Jeffrey Sachs. The thing, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2230.88s)]
*  though, there is Jeffrey Sachs in the video also really criticizes Barack Obama for the [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2236.64s)]
*  dirty war in Syria. And that, if I could guess, is why Trump actually shared that. I somehow [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2241.04s)]
*  doubt Trump was trying to send that message. I just agree with both of you on that. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  He just heard the part where Jeffrey Sachs was criticizing Barack Obama and blaming him for it. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2250.3199999999997s)]
*  So then Trump was like, send. But the fact is he left that up. And that does speak to Trump's [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2254.96s)]
*  unique thing. When he was in office, he talked about there being a military industrial complex. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2260.4s)]
*  He does say these things that no one else will say. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2264.72s)]
*  And maybe he said that too in his farewell address. He referenced the military. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2268.48s)]
*  He talked about the tech. No, he said, well, he said President Eisenhower [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2271.6s)]
*  warned about the military industrial complex. So too do I now warned about the tech. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2276.0s)]
*  Yes, and that's because Elon Musk backed Trump. If Elon Musk backed him, he wouldn't have warned [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2279.6s)]
*  about that. Right now, all I'm saying is that there have been a lot of prominent political figures [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2283.12s)]
*  in both parties who at least make reference nominally to the military industrial complex. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2287.12s)]
*  OK, so here's Netanyahu for the first time publicly addressing the ceasefire deal yesterday. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2291.12s)]
*  Since he was elected, Trump was completely committed to the release of the hostages. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2296.24s)]
*  We spoke on Wednesday. He congratulated me on the agreement. And he emphasized, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2301.3599999999997s)]
*  and rightly so, that the first stage is a temporary ceasefire. This is what he said, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  a temporary ceasefire. Towards the next stages of the agreement, we are holding on to some [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2311.6s)]
*  significant assets so that we can bring back all of the hostages and in order to accomplish [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2318.64s)]
*  all the goals of the war. Both President Trump and President Biden have provided full backing [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2325.04s)]
*  to Israel's right to resume fighting, to resume combat if Israel reaches the conclusion that the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2331.3599999999997s)]
*  negotiations over the second stage are pointless. I truly appreciate that. I also appreciate the [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2338.16s)]
*  decision of President Trump to lift all the remaining restrictions on the providing of [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2344.56s)]
*  essential munitions and weapons to the state of Israel. If we need to resume combat, we will do [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2351.36s)]
*  so in new ways and we will do so with tremendous force. He's trying to save face to his people, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2356.96s)]
*  I think, because they're in shock and he has to do something with his right wing members of his [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2367.92s)]
*  coalition. So you think he's just making up the entire interaction with Trump? I think it's [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2372.96s)]
*  possible Trump may have said something, but Trump doesn't mean that either. I don't know. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2375.84s)]
*  That's a lot of mind reading. Those are two very real possibilities. Either he's embellishing [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2382.64s)]
*  because he has to save face to his extremist coalition, he has to look tough, and then Trump [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2387.04s)]
*  never said that, which is quite possible for Netanyahu because he's a serial liar. So I wouldn't [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2392.2400000000002s)]
*  put it past him just to make that up. Or at the same time, Trump is obviously very deferential [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2396.8s)]
*  to Israel and to Mary Madelson. So it also wouldn't surprise me if Netanyahu's account is correct. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2401.12s)]
*  I don't think Trump is deferential to Israel anymore. And another thing his envoy said today, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2405.92s)]
*  Witkoff wants to visit Gaza and see for himself the destruction that the people have endured. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2411.52s)]
*  No one near Biden ever said anything remotely like that. He said he wants to go and visit the [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2415.92s)]
*  people and see what it's like. So I have to say, I'm obviously skeptical of Trump. I'm not ready to [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2423.3599999999997s)]
*  go full in, but I'm very impressed with him so far, what he's done. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2431.12s)]
*  You are wearing red. You aren't fully wearing the hat yet, but I feel like the red top, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2434.48s)]
*  it's like a nod towards your red. Well, and then a TikTok fan. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2440.3199999999997s)]
*  Aaron, I want to present this gift to you. This will be the official Trump yarmulke. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2444.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not giving it to you. This is one of my most prized possessions. I wear this. It covers up the [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2450.72s)]
*  hair fitting actually nicely. So as penance for all my horrible judgment that I need to apologize [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2455.68s)]
*  for, for covering like Trump's rhetoric and policies, I will wear the Trump yarmulke for [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2463.52s)]
*  the remainder of the show. And who gave this to you by the way? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2468.56s)]
*  The Republican Jewish Coalition. And was this when you went on a college campus [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2472.8799999999997s)]
*  wearing a different yarmulke to see if you would be? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2479.6s)]
*  No, that was that was months before. I have a whole catalog of them. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2482.72s)]
*  So it could be that Daniel who is embellishing. But at the same time, Trump, I guess we're not [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2490.24s)]
*  supposed to ignore this, but Trump spent the entire campaign in 2024 saying that Biden had [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2498.9599999999996s)]
*  betrayed Israel and he was becoming like a Palestinian because he was imposing too many [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2503.68s)]
*  constraints on Israel's ability to wage war in Gaza. I don't know what constraints or [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2508.56s)]
*  restrictions they're even referring to because even the 2000 pound bomb one was eventually lifted. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2512.88s)]
*  But maybe there's something I don't know maybe to do with Iran or whatever. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2517.6000000000004s)]
*  And it's that Netanyahu's point is being echoed over and over again by Mike Waltz. Again, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2521.04s)]
*  I never understand like how seriously we're supposed to take the words of the people who [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2526.0s)]
*  are announcing that they're speaking on behalf. So Mike Waltz is not speaking on behalf of Trump? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2530.48s)]
*  No, I don't take the words. I don't take the words of politicians seriously at all. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2536.32s)]
*  Like I assume their words have nothing to do with what they actually believe or any kind. They have [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2540.8s)]
*  no reflection on reality. They're just saying things to get elected and to get money. And you [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2544.88s)]
*  have to look carefully at their actions, what they've done in the past and that kind of thing. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2548.88s)]
*  And I don't think you can ever be certain. But Mike Waltz is not trying to get elected right now. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2553.6800000000003s)]
*  He was appointed national security advisor. Mike Waltz might believe it, but I don't think that [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2557.28s)]
*  necessarily has any influence on Trump's policy. He's speaking on behalf. So you should think [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2562.32s)]
*  speaking in a way that is detached from what Trump's approach is. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2566.56s)]
*  I do think that Mike Waltz and Ruby are both very malleable and they know their role. And whatever [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2571.2799999999997s)]
*  Trump says, I do think they will enact, but that could go either way. So for example, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2576.0s)]
*  Mike Waltz was a strong advocate of letting Ukraine use long range US missiles to fire into Russia. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2579.68s)]
*  If Trump follows through on his criticism of that and stops that, I do think Mike Waltz will go [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2586.72s)]
*  along with that. But at the same time, I also, Mike, listen, I think you're exactly on point. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  All these people are openly saying that we're not backing Israel enough. And I think it's very [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2595.6s)]
*  reasonable to expect that that will reflect their policy once they come into office, especially [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2600.0s)]
*  given who their donors are and what their record is. I mean, Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2604.48s)]
*  He recognized Israel's theft of the Golan Heights. He, you know, and he said he bragged about how he [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2610.16s)]
*  was doing this on behalf of the Adelson. So I won't be surprised at all if all your criticisms [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2615.12s)]
*  turn out to reflect exactly what the policy is. But at the same time, I also don't want to rule [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2623.04s)]
*  out the possibility that you're raising that actually we are going to see something different [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2627.52s)]
*  because perhaps Trump, for transactional reasons, sees some benefit in stopping all this carnage [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2631.04s)]
*  and doing something differently than Biden. And he did go to Michigan. He did tell [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2635.2s)]
*  Arabs and Muslims there that he wanted peace. Maybe he'll see that to his advantage electorally [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2639.6s)]
*  to follow through on that. Well, he doesn't need any electoral advantage because he's already elected. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2644.88s)]
*  But I mean, he might see it. I mean, I do think he, you know, he wants to have a legacy and he [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2649.52s)]
*  knows that this would be a great legacy. I also don't think he's a committed Zionist like Biden [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2654.64s)]
*  or Hillary Clinton or those people. I know you don't like the word neocon, but you know, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2659.44s)]
*  that type of person, neoliberal neocon. I don't think he really cares. He has he does have a son [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2663.7599999999998s)]
*  in law. I'm sure, you know, Tiffany's husband is Lebanese and her father has a position in the [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2669.44s)]
*  administration. You know, people are influenced by those around them. He might very well have had [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2675.52s)]
*  some influence there. I do think that's such an important point. He's not a committed ideologue [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2679.92s)]
*  like Biden. Biden actually believes in all this stuff. He's been talking for decades about how [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2684.64s)]
*  we need it. If Israel didn't exist, we'd have to create it ourselves. And you see that in how he [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2688.88s)]
*  talks, how just how much he believes in this Israeli project of having a proxy that acts as [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2692.72s)]
*  the U.S. enforcer in the region. You know, he believes in that. Trump doesn't care about that. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2700.72s)]
*  And that doesn't. But his his lack of maybe committed ideological tendencies overall in [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2705.6s)]
*  the first term contributed to him outsourcing Israel policy to those most hardened dialogues, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2712.4s)]
*  including religious fanatics. Yeah. Like John Hagee, who was a frequent White House visitor, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2718.88s)]
*  who gave the opening benediction at the establishment of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2724.0s)]
*  And he appointed Mike Huckabee as Israel ambassador, who is a literal end times believer [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2731.36s)]
*  and is the most extreme of the extreme and aligns more with the hardcore messianic element within [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2737.68s)]
*  Israel, who until now always loved Trump. I think maybe they should be there if they're repudiating [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2743.68s)]
*  Trump. It might be a bit premature. So I guess my point is the lack of an established or defined [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2750.0s)]
*  ideological tendency, whether it's Zionism or something else, kind of go both ways. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2756.64s)]
*  Sure. But a couple of points there. First of all, I mean, he may well have promised [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2761.44s)]
*  Miriam Adelson, look, I'll make Mike Huckabee ambassador to Israel if you give me whatever [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2764.96s)]
*  amount of money in your support. And he may have known in the back of his mind, OK, I'll do this. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2769.12s)]
*  But that doesn't mean I have to do anything specific on the ground. The other thing is that [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2772.72s)]
*  a lot of people didn't, you know, as I learned after October 7th, a lot of people barely knew [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2775.92s)]
*  what Gaza was. They knew nothing about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He might not [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2780.08s)]
*  have known very much four or five, whatever. I can't remember when he moved embassy seven years ago, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2784.08s)]
*  but he may have learned a lot in the past year. You know, seeing I've heard from people who know [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2788.7200000000003s)]
*  him. I happen to know a lot of Republicans like close to him. I've heard that he's actually very [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2793.44s)]
*  upset. He saw the pictures of the children, you know, dead children, and he said he wanted [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2799.12s)]
*  to put an end to it. Whereas Biden was shown those pictures by people in the State Department [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2802.72s)]
*  working for him. And he said, I don't want, you know, we're not changing our policy. I don't want [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2806.3999999999996s)]
*  to see any more of this. So that's why I mean, that's why I have some hope. And like I reserve [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2808.9599999999996s)]
*  the right to be wrong. I might be wrong. I'm not like 100 percent confident. But if Trump was so [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2813.3599999999997s)]
*  aghast at the gruesome images of the children being bombed, why did he never express a hint [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2819.3599999999997s)]
*  of opposition to the bombing campaign and instead called on Biden to expedite weapons so Israel [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2827.2s)]
*  could more aggressively wage the bombing campaign? Right. I remember Trump's criticism being that [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2833.2s)]
*  Israel wasn't clamping down on the dissemination of images. So it was causing a PR problem. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2837.7599999999998s)]
*  That wasn't the quote. The quote was and it was taken out of context. The quote was these images [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2844.4s)]
*  are very bad for Israel. They need to finish the job and get out of there. He was he was I forgot [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2849.44s)]
*  exactly what he said, but the quote was taken to mean they should just basically nuke it. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2854.08s)]
*  And, you know, that was the end. He was basically saying, get out like now. Stop this. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2858.56s)]
*  This is all very bad. He did not say that they should clamp down on the job, meaning [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2862.7999999999997s)]
*  accelerate the war. That's not when you read that when you read the entire paragraph that [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2866.72s)]
*  wasn't what he said over and over again. It was not until this month that he any any came anywhere [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2872.56s)]
*  close to expressing support for a ceasefire. He was attacking Kamala Harris for fecklessly [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2877.92s)]
*  supporting a ceasefire during the campaign. Mike, I think there's plenty of public evidence to [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2884.16s)]
*  support your position. And I think to support the contrary position, there's a lot of just hope and [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2888.4s)]
*  the fact that the Biden administration was so bad that almost anything would be better. And, you know, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2893.28s)]
*  and we'll the proof will be in the pudding. We're about to find out. I talked I went to the [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2898.16s)]
*  Kentucky State Society of Kentucky Ball on Friday night and I talked to Congressman Jim [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2903.36s)]
*  Jamie Comer, who, by the way, had the pointless impeachment Biden impeachment inquiry that he [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2910.48s)]
*  ran. Everybody forgot about that. They were like, he was being grandly touted as a thing [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2916.2400000000002s)]
*  that was going to really stick it to Biden and just fizzled. But anyway, I asked him about this [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2921.2000000000003s)]
*  issue and he said his and his interpretation was that Hamas was so scared of Trump that they [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2925.28s)]
*  finally gave in to the demand. So it's being spun in a way, at least among some Republicans, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2932.88s)]
*  that this is great for Trump because he finally struck fear into the hearts of Hamas. And Comer [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2939.04s)]
*  specifically said to me, actually look at the exact quote, but it was something like Hamas knows [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2944.32s)]
*  that Trump will give Israel whatever it needs to finish the job. Yes. So there's like a number of [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2947.84s)]
*  interpretations here. Yeah. And I think, you know, if you look at the vast majority of the public [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2952.7200000000003s)]
*  record, it establishes that Republicans are not. I mean, if Trump gets into office and withholds [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2960.32s)]
*  arm shipments in a way that Biden never did, then I will freely acknowledge that that counteract, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2967.84s)]
*  counter contradicts a lot of what thematically I had assumed was being built up to it just based [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2974.48s)]
*  on his rhetoric and policy. But until then, I think people should maybe reserve judgment slightly. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2980.48s)]
*  I 100% agree. 100% agree. Because like trying to replicate the Reagan coming into office with the [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2985.84s)]
*  Iran hostages, part of that could be PR. Obviously, there is a cessation of hostilities in Gaza right [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2990.32s)]
*  now as of this morning. So that's significant. But I'm not willing to declare myself to have [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=2996.8s)]
*  entirely loved everything and apologize. I haven't broken out the champagne yet. But, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3006.56s)]
*  you know, and I could be wrong. I acknowledge very much that like we're at the beginning of this, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3010.56s)]
*  but all the signs I see are very hopeful and they were aligned with what I had sort of perceived [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3014.96s)]
*  before, which I guess makes me a little bit more confident about my assessment. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3019.04s)]
*  Okay. And so here's one thing I'll say too is, you know, the, I can tell you from firsthand [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3022.56s)]
*  knowledge that there are people around Trump who have actual, who have expressed interest [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3027.2s)]
*  in the contrary point of view into in the pro-Palestinian position, if you want to call it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3034.08s)]
*  For what it's worth. So at least there- Would you like to name any names? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3039.6s)]
*  No, I can't. But I can say, and also I can tell you, I will say, and this is where I totally agree [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3042.24s)]
*  with you, Mike, that, you know, if Trump actually withholds weapons, that would be something [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3047.92s)]
*  significant because people like to think that the, like this goal of the Saudi normalization deal, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3052.32s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Israel normalizing, that that's like Trump's big card that he's going to play. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3057.92s)]
*  That's the, that's the peace deal. Yeah. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3062.32s)]
*  But I don't think honestly Israel cares that much about normalizing with Saudi Arabia. I mean, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3064.08s)]
*  the U.S. wants, you know, people in the Trump camp want that because they want to make even [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3070.16s)]
*  more money with Saudi Arabia. But Israel itself doesn't, I don't think, care as much about that [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3074.16s)]
*  as other people might think because they already have, they control the West Bank and Gaza with [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3079.04s)]
*  very little resistance. They, you know, they've just helped overthrow the government in Syria, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3084.3999999999996s)]
*  Hezbollah has been weakened, Iran has been weakened, and they have all the money in the [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3089.2s)]
*  world coming in from the U.S. And so the one card that really matters is the U.S. military and [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3093.04s)]
*  financial support. And unless that is threatened. I think it must have been though, because I mean, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3097.92s)]
*  reports are that, um, Wettkopf went to Trump and basically told him he better take the deal. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3103.28s)]
*  What would be the leverage? To Netanyahu. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3108.48s)]
*  Yeah. What would be the leverage? It's to me, the only thing he has is weapons. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3110.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, to me, my interpretation is that the leverage is that for the first time, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3114.0s)]
*  the position that Israel ought to accept a ceasefire was finally embraced by both parties, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3120.6400000000003s)]
*  including the incoming administration. From May until last year until January, that position was [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3126.32s)]
*  at least only publicly and nominally taken by the outgoing Biden administration. Now that Netanyahu [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3132.56s)]
*  lost the partisan triangulation leverage that he had against the U.S., where he could play politically [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3139.92s)]
*  off the Republicans being opposed to Biden on this issue, then he lost all wiggle room. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3145.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, this is obviously speculation, but I can't imagine that that would be enough. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3150.32s)]
*  Netanyahu did not want to ceasefire. He's now, you know, his right-wing coalition is basically [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3155.12s)]
*  disbanding. A large portion of the Israeli population is mad at him. I guess not, what is [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3160.72s)]
*  it, like 20 percent? But I can't imagine that it, I think it had to be something much more specific [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3165.68s)]
*  than just, okay, it looks like both parties are. I think it's a fair point. I think that's, yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3171.9199999999996s)]
*  So here's Mike Walz on Face the Nation today. Will the Trump team see this through to completion? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3175.2s)]
*  Well, remember, the terms of the deal that we finally have come to was inherited in many [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3182.7999999999997s)]
*  ways from the Biden administration. So it was actually the Biden negotiators that were at the [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3190.48s)]
*  table. And the other side was dealing with them, but kind of looking to us, particularly Steve [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3194.96s)]
*  Witkoff, President Trump's Middle East envoy. And one of the things that we inherited was this [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3202.32s)]
*  framework of women, the elderly, and the sick coming out first. One of the Americans is an Israeli [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3208.32s)]
*  soldier. That means they'll come out in the second phase, but we will get him out, period. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3218.08s)]
*  Aidan Alexander. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3224.88s)]
*  And Aidan Alexander. And I am convinced, Margaret, that this deal would have never happened had [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3225.7599999999998s)]
*  President Trump not been elected. The Trump effect, so to speak. The families believe that. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3231.12s)]
*  They were effusive in their thanks for him and the truth that he put out that put Hamas on notice [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3237.44s)]
*  that there will be consequences if they don't let our people go. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3244.56s)]
*  There is also, obviously, the party, Israel, here, that feels some pressure to get this done. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3248.32s)]
*  One far-right member of the Netanyahu government resigned. Another this morning said he will bring [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3255.84s)]
*  down the Netanyahu government if it does not return to fighting in a way that leads Israel [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3261.36s)]
*  to taking over the entire Gaza Strip. Does Mr. Trump support annexation of the West Bank and Gaza? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3266.64s)]
*  Well, excuse me, very different things. What we're talking about here is making sure that Hamas [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3273.7599999999998s)]
*  is destroyed as a terrorist organization. Hamas is no different than ISIS or Al-Qaeda, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3280.88s)]
*  or any of the worst of the worst that has so brutalized the Middle East over the years. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3287.68s)]
*  And what we have made clear to Bibi Netanyahu, to his government, and I want the Israeli people [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3293.04s)]
*  to hear me loud and clear, if Hamas reneges on this deal, if Hamas backs out, moves the goalpost, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3299.12s)]
*  what have you, we will support Israel in doing what it has to do, number one. And number two, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3305.92s)]
*  Hamas will never govern Gaza. That is completely unacceptable because they've made their intention [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3311.44s)]
*  clear, which is to destroy Israel and to have future October 7th. So I understand the concern, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3317.7599999999998s)]
*  but at the end of the day, Prime Minister Netanyahu supported this deal. He agreed we needed [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3324.48s)]
*  to get those hostages out. And within the next 24 hours, we will see three women coming out alive [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3329.28s)]
*  and hugging their families. And had we not entered this, these people would have died. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3338.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. So that's Walt's basically echoing with what Netanyahu said yesterday, right? Not totally. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3344.32s)]
*  But he's saying that the U.S. under Trump will give Israel full backing to resume fighting [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3350.64s)]
*  in Gaza should Hamas renege on the deal. And if history is any guide, Israel will find the [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3357.44s)]
*  flimsiest pretext to claim that Hamas has somehow reneged on some aspect of the deal. That's what [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3363.6s)]
*  Israel has basically done in every comparable scenario in the past. And Netanyahu apparently [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3368.64s)]
*  has already assured Smotrich, the hardcore right wing member of the coalition who hasn't resigned, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3376.72s)]
*  unlike Ben Gavir, who did that one of the conditions of the acceptance of this deal was that [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3382.24s)]
*  the war will resume. And Walt is saying preemptively that the U.S. will under Trump will support that. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3387.68s)]
*  Now, I know people want to say Walt doesn't speak for Trump. I don't know. Like Walt's goes on [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3394.24s)]
*  television and says, I want to make sure I'm making an announcement clear to Israel on behalf of the [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3398.56s)]
*  incoming president, Donald J. Trump. Like what? We think that he's not speaking with authorization [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3403.28s)]
*  there? That seems implausible to me. He may very well be speaking with on behalf of Trump, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3409.2000000000003s)]
*  but I don't think that necessarily means that Trump is going to OK or return to hostilities. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3415.52s)]
*  Netanyahu can say Hamas did X, Y or Z tiny thing. And so I should get to renege on this deal. But [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3421.28s)]
*  that doesn't mean Trump's going to accept it. And I think his actions so far have shown that he's [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3426.88s)]
*  not going to. Again, I could be wrong. All right. So one final question. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3430.64s)]
*  What are you what's like the most optimistic scenario for the next Trump administration? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3436.72s)]
*  And what's the least optimistic scenario? So it's like the what's the best case scenario [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3444.4s)]
*  in the worst case scenario for all answer first? I think one thing that I think is probably likely [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3448.48s)]
*  to happen is that there will be a rollback of some of these NGOs and all these kind of scam [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3453.76s)]
*  nonprofits that somehow finagle themselves to get government subsidy to run outfits that they claim [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3463.44s)]
*  are combating disinformation and misinformation and basically pressure people to restrict speech. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3471.84s)]
*  I think like Republicans in general are like rightly skeptical of that whole enterprise. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3478.32s)]
*  Especially because it's obviously always employed for or tends to be employed for like nakedly [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3483.52s)]
*  partisan purposes. That's a plausible best. I don't know if it's the overall best case scenario, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3488.48s)]
*  but something I'm looking forward to that I would look favorably upon in terms of bad stuff. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3495.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, it's it's in part related to something that I've been having a premonition about, which [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3500.96s)]
*  is that Trump really seems to have like a world historic cult of personality behind him now [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3506.48s)]
*  or cult devotion. That's not to say that every Trump supporter is a cultist. I'm not saying that. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3512.88s)]
*  There are plenty of people who are, you know, essentially normal who voted for Trump for [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3517.52s)]
*  essentially normal reasons. But he does have a fanaticism among a certain segment of his [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3521.84s)]
*  support base that is will support anything. I mean, in part it relates to like the slightly [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3528.7200000000003s)]
*  more hierarchical nature of maybe people on the right versus the left like you did for better, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3533.92s)]
*  you know, forever. However much you want to criticize how the left has conformed itself. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3538.72s)]
*  There was a big protest movement against Biden over Gaza policy. It didn't really amount to much, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3543.8399999999997s)]
*  but it was there. It's hard to see anything comparable like that happening on the right [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3548.7999999999997s)]
*  against Trump. Right. And so I think back to January of 2020 when Trump did the drone strike [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3553.2799999999997s)]
*  assassination of Soleimani. And I just remember being inundated with people who were angrily [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3559.68s)]
*  insisting to me that this was like part of the America First foreign policy, you know, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3566.0s)]
*  doing drone strike assassinations of meddlesome Iranian generals when they're on like some kind [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3569.92s)]
*  of diplomatic mission to Iraq. So I could just see that there's something unexpected or whatever [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3575.12s)]
*  comes up and along those lines of the Soleimani assassination and you see instant coalescence [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3581.04s)]
*  of the increasingly ascendant like alternative media, right wing adjacent media and the right [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3589.36s)]
*  wing office holders fully in support of it. And they find a way to kind of rationalize it as part [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3595.04s)]
*  of America First. And I think Biden kind of had less less standing to do that among the left, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3600.0s)]
*  not that it really impeded his ability to do very much, whether it was in Ukraine or Gaza. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3608.08s)]
*  But I just kind of I can't prove it. It's just a premonition. I can see something like that happening [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3613.68s)]
*  with Trump that could be somewhat ominous. So how do you answer both scenario questions, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3618.56s)]
*  Janine? Best case and worst case. What I'm really optimistic about is, you know, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3626.24s)]
*  that he gets us out of these wars and he sort of puts an end to the failed neocon policy that [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3631.2799999999997s)]
*  basically every administration for the last couple of decades has held on to. I know you [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3636.4s)]
*  don't like that word. I don't really know a better one. The idea that we need American [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3639.92s)]
*  primacy around the world and we just need to, you know, I think we should be investing our money at [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3643.04s)]
*  home. I don't have a problem with my tax money going to help Americans who are less fortunate [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3648.16s)]
*  than me. I do have a problem with it going to wars abroad. Another topic on which I think he and I [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3653.8399999999997s)]
*  see eye to eye is a lot of free speech stuff, at least to a certain extent. That's, you know, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3659.8399999999997s)]
*  I haven't talked about it. But not anti-Semitism. Not anti-Semitic speech. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3664.24s)]
*  Well, wait, let me get there. Let me get there. OK, that's that's actually and I haven't talked [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3666.8799999999997s)]
*  about that. I'm a free speech lawyer. My bread and butter has been dealing. Sorry, maybe I should [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3671.6s)]
*  have introduced you. I'm actually not a foreign policy analyst. My work for the past couple of [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3675.44s)]
*  years has been suing the government for its involvement in tech censorship. He's been very [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  good on that. He's indicated that he's going to roll back a lot of the measures these agencies [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3686.32s)]
*  have taken to work with the tech companies or threaten them and pressure them to censor speech. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3691.92s)]
*  He also today said he was basically issued an executive order saying he was going to put the [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3696.16s)]
*  TikTok ban on hold, which I'm very pleased about. But as you've said, he has said things on the [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3700.56s)]
*  other side when it comes to anti-Semitic speech for, you know, that's the big exception on the [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3707.68s)]
*  right for when they laugh about hate speech being censored. But of course, anti-Semitic speech should [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3711.12s)]
*  be and we should deport students who are non-citizens who say anything anti-Semitic, blah, blah. He's [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3716.56s)]
*  said he has he's indicated he supports that in some ways. So that would be a really big problem [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3721.84s)]
*  for me. I was always worried he might get us into a war with Iran because he's said some hotheaded [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3727.04s)]
*  things about Iran. I think that much more much less now, much less concerned about that. I think the [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3731.6s)]
*  indications he's made over the past week or so show that he really doesn't want to be embroiled [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3737.2799999999997s)]
*  in more Middle East wars. He could just. He thinks that Iran tried to assassinate him. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3741.04s)]
*  Well, that's yes. That seems like a pretty viable pretext for some kind of action. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3747.68s)]
*  That is probably my biggest concern. But I think the Gaza situation or his [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3754.8s)]
*  brokering a ceasefire in Gaza indicates that he doesn't want to be embroiled in a war in that [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3760.5600000000004s)]
*  region. But I have some concerns. I'm not totally without any concerns. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3765.28s)]
*  Are you have an annex in Greenland? Are you all for that? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3769.76s)]
*  I have like no opinion on that. I can only have so many opinions. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3773.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Not everyone needs to have a strong view on Greenland. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3776.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, you know, one thing that bothers me about him is I don't think he's extremely principled. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3782.5600000000004s)]
*  He can act a little bit hot headedly. So as sort of a general matter, I think that opens us up to [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3788.7200000000003s)]
*  policies that aren't always the best ones. So I don't know that I have like a lot of specific [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3793.36s)]
*  fears, but I do hope that everything he you know, that he takes his decision making processes [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3796.88s)]
*  seriously. Maybe he learned a little bit from his last administration. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3803.6000000000004s)]
*  What's up? How you doing? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3806.0800000000004s)]
*  Good. Somebody outside the window just appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3807.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, that guy person, that person. OK. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3816.96s)]
*  That's one of my MAGA fans. Yeah. Again, Russiagate. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3820.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I have a lot of MAGA fans, too. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3824.0s)]
*  I've had the MAGA fans over the years. I don't know if they're losing them. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3827.68s)]
*  I know. I repudiate my fans left and right until I have none left. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3830.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. My my optimistic, somewhat plausible optimistic scenario is, yeah, Trump sees it [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3836.48s)]
*  in his interest to have peace in Gaza and let Gaza rebuild. Although again, I think that's [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3842.48s)]
*  such an impossible dream. But I that's just my top hope right now. Shuts down the war in Ukraine, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3851.12s)]
*  realizes that this is a disaster, negotiates a peace deal with Russia that meets some of its [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3856.88s)]
*  security concerns. You know, no Ukraine and NATO, a rollback of some of the offensive weaponry that's [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3861.92s)]
*  on Russia's borders and some arrangement for the ethnic Russians in the east of Ukraine [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3867.84s)]
*  along the lines of the Minsk Accords. And domestically, that he doesn't rip people off [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3874.6400000000003s)]
*  as much as he did the first term passing the tax heist, which is what I regarded, which I thought [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3881.76s)]
*  overwhelmingly favored Trump and his wealthy friends maybe being a bit more equitable this time. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3886.64s)]
*  Well, I'm going to predict right now that the Republicans will in fact pass a renewal of the [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3892.3199999999997s)]
*  Trump. But then, you know, like to be fair, you know, I hear this from MAGA people that they, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3897.12s)]
*  you know, who are not high income, who they feel as if the tax cuts benefited them. So, you know, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3902.0s)]
*  I want to be fair to them, but it just and I got it. I'm not an economist, but my sense was that [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3907.6s)]
*  these tax cuts that Trump passed favor Delta wealthy. So being maybe a bit more equitable [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3911.52s)]
*  this time and also more transparency. You know, Trump was the target of one of the biggest scams [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3915.76s)]
*  in U.S. history, Russia gate, where he was framed as a Russian agent by his opponents with the help [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3923.84s)]
*  of U.S. intelligence officials. And we still don't know a lot about it. So there's still, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3928.48s)]
*  you know, recently I had a document released by the FBI that goes to the heart of Russia gate [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3933.92s)]
*  that was heavily, heavily redacted. So I hope that Trump sees it in his own personal interest [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3938.6400000000003s)]
*  to have more transparency on intelligence abuses like Russia gate. And there are plenty others, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3943.92s)]
*  even if you only focused on Democrat abuses, like in Democratic projects like the war in Ukraine, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3948.7200000000003s)]
*  which Democrats really helped start with the coup in 2014 and the dirty war in Syria. He can do a [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3955.28s)]
*  lot of social good by just releasing documents that give the public an idea of what their [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3960.2400000000002s)]
*  government was up to. And that was kept from the public. So, you know, I'm tailoring this [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3964.08s)]
*  optimism to what I think Trump might hopefully see to be in his interest. And one of those could be [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3968.8s)]
*  transparency on these major issues that the public has been kept in the dark about. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7-S78eDFjU&t=3973.76s)]
