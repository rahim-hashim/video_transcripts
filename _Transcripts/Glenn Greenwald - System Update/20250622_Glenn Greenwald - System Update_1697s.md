# BREAKING: Trump Enters Israel's War With Iran
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ)
*  Good afternoon, everybody. As you can obviously see, I am not at home, or at least I'm not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  in the studio. That you can certainly see. I'm actually at a farm, so if you hear farm [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=10.48s)]
*  animals in the background, don't be alarmed. The reason is that I'm surrounded by farm [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=14.88s)]
*  animals. But nonetheless, despite not being able to go into the studio, despite being [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=18.68s)]
*  Sunday, wanted to go live to talk about what is easily the most consequential event and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=22.36s)]
*  decision of the Trump administration yet. And that's saying something since among other [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=29.6s)]
*  things in foreign policy, Trump already authorized and gave the green light to Israel to go and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=35.92s)]
*  abandon the ceasefire that he negotiated right before he was inaugurated to continue to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  destroy Gaza with the United States paying for it and arming it. He also decided to restart [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=44.88s)]
*  the bombing campaign of Yemen and the Houthis, which President Biden also ordered throughout [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  2024, though Trump escalated significantly and then stopped it. But a war with Iran, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=58.08s)]
*  which is obviously what this is, is by far the most consequential and the most dangerous [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=61.8s)]
*  and the most potentially destructive decision yet. I don't think there's really a close [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=68.84s)]
*  second in terms of historic significance. Now, just for those of you who haven't heard, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=73.2s)]
*  and I doubt there are many of you who haven't, last night, President Trump did what he had [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  more or less been signaling quite clearly for many days that he would do, which is he [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=83.6s)]
*  dispatched all sorts of U.S. military assets, including B-2 bombers and off-the-coast submarines [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=89.64s)]
*  to bomb and send missiles toward the three main Iranian nuclear facilities. He dropped [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  at least six bunker busters from B-2, six of them. On one site, he used Tomahawk missiles [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=104.88s)]
*  from submarines to attack two others. And as soon as he was done with that, this gigantic aerial [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  assault and amphibious assault on Iranian soil, on Iranian sovereignty, that according to Trump, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  and we'll get to this in a minute, quote, completely obliterated Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=129.04s)]
*  He then immediately took to social, also gave a speech at the White House surrounded by [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=134.24s)]
*  JD Vance, the Vice President, Marco Rubio, and Pete Hegseth, in which he said, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=139.4s)]
*  Okay, now's the time for peace. We just bombed you, but we don't want any more war. We just [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=144.12s)]
*  wanted to bomb you, drop massive amounts of ordnance on your country, and now we would like to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  have peace. Let's not do any more. And the Iranians, both before the U.S. strike and since, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=154.52s)]
*  have made very clear that they feel obligated and duty-bound to retaliate, as any country [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=160.84s)]
*  would when a foreign country just invades their airspace, invades their sea lanes, and shoots [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  massive amounts of explosive devices onto Iranian soil. The Iranians have all sorts of retaliatory [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=177.56s)]
*  options. There are many troops, the American troops, in Iraq still. We don't talk about that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=184.28s)]
*  very much, but they are still there. And the ostensible mission is to train various units of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=192.04s)]
*  the Iraqi military and to stabilize them and to strengthen them. Unfortunately, for the troops [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=196.92s)]
*  that are there, the dominant units within the Iraqi military are very loyal to Tehran. And so, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=201.72s)]
*  all of those soldiers in Iraq are extremely vulnerable to attack. There are also numerous [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=208.6s)]
*  military bases throughout the region, U.S. military bases. Some are very large and hardened, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=216.44s)]
*  like the one in Qatar, but many are small and vulnerable. The Iranians have already demonstrated [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=221.4s)]
*  their ballistic missile capability. After President Trump assassinated General Soleimani in 2020, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=227.96s)]
*  the Iranians retaliated by shooting at some of those bases, killing service members. They [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=236.52s)]
*  certainly have the ability to do that as well. They have militias in Iraq and elsewhere that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=240.52s)]
*  are capable of that as well. They can target U.S. oil infrastructure or the infrastructure [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=245.32s)]
*  of U.S. allies, such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, and even Saudi Arabia, and cause [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=252.92s)]
*  massive global economic disruption. They can close the Strait of Hormuz, the Iranian parliament, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=258.68s)]
*  which is pretty symbolic and powerless. Voted today to have that happen, though it's the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=264.92s)]
*  Supreme Leader al-Khomeini who will ultimately make that decision. So, for anyone who thinks [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=269.88s)]
*  that the Iranians don't have serious military and retaliatory capability that are at their disposal, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  you're thinking very naively. I remember hearing the night of the attack, the first night of the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=282.28s)]
*  U.S.-supported Israel attack on Iran, all of this triumphalist rhetoric about how the Israelis had [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=290.2s)]
*  decapitated the Iranian military, how they had taken out their key military bases, that there was [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=295.88s)]
*  no way the Iranians could even get together enough command and control communication in order to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=302.76s)]
*  strike back. And of course, the Iranians have struck back. They've struck back against all [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  major Israeli cities, and they haven't even used their most potent weapons to do so, and they've [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=314.36s)]
*  caused a lot of damage and a good amount of casualties, both deaths and people who are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=318.76s)]
*  wounded. They certainly have a lot of more military capability, even though their military has been [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=325.0s)]
*  degraded. So, when you go and attack some other country, there's always a risk that they're going [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=329.64s)]
*  to attack you back. It doesn't even have to be immediate. Iran has proxies and units all throughout [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=336.76s)]
*  the world that can attack South American targets, could target American citizens at any time, in the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  next week, in the next month, in the next year. Every single time we go, the United States goes [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=347.96s)]
*  and starts a new military war, a new military conflict in the Middle East, there's always what [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=354.84s)]
*  the CIA calls blowback. People have made such a big deal about the fact that the Iranians chant [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=361.0s)]
*  death to America. The reason they chant death to America, and it's been a chant of the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=367.23999999999995s)]
*  Islamic revolution since 1979, is because the CIA decided in 1954 to go into Iran, overthrow [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=374.84s)]
*  their democratically elected leader because he was a bit too independent for our liking, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=382.52s)]
*  and replaced him with a brutal, vicious tyrant, the Shah of Iran, who proceeded to murder [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=387.24s)]
*  dissidents and people practicing Islam, people opposed to the government, murder them, torture [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=395.0s)]
*  them, imprison them, drive them into exile, and he ruled over that country with an iron fist for the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  next 26 years until 1979 when the people of Iran overthrew him. And when Iran went and attacked [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=407.32s)]
*  the U.S. embassy and held embassy personnel hostage, they did so because they perceived [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=415.0s)]
*  the United States as their gravest enemy for an obvious reason. If you lived in a country [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=420.52s)]
*  with a democratically elected government and a foreign government came and helped overthrow [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=425.4s)]
*  the democratically elected government that you had and imposed on you, not just a vicious tyrant, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=430.6s)]
*  but one who was a puppet of the United States and Israel, you would obviously hate that country too. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=435.4s)]
*  You can go around South America and talk to any of the countries, the many countries, the people in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=440.76s)]
*  many countries that the CIA did the same to in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and those people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=445.23999999999995s)]
*  remember too, they have extreme anti-American sentiment. Obviously, that's one of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=454.35999999999996s)]
*  consequences of going around bombing, starting wars, overthrowing governments, is that you build [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  up a lot of anti-American sentiment to say nothing of the ongoing U.S. arming and funding [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=463.0s)]
*  of the destruction of Gaza. So maybe as Trump seems to be suggesting slash hoping, the Iranians will [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=467.0s)]
*  just say, you know what, this isn't worth it. They bombed us, but we don't need to do anything back. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=476.28s)]
*  And so all hostilities will end and the Iranians will just go to the peace table and negotiate [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=481.0s)]
*  a deal this time and they'll give up all rights to nuclear energy as Trump is demanding. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=485.24s)]
*  And then the war will be over, but maybe that won't happen. I would say there's a lot better [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=490.28s)]
*  chance that that won't happen. And I would also suggest to you that the people trying to encourage [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=496.76s)]
*  you to believe that this is going to be some quick, easy strike, just a precision strike one night [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=502.35999999999996s)]
*  and there's no more U.S. involvement are the people who are most hoping that they're wrong when they [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  tell you that, or at least that what they get you to believe is wrong. They want you to believe that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  they want to drag the U.S. into a protracted war. And they obviously know that the Iranians [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=520.2s)]
*  have almost a political and moral necessity to prove they're a real sovereign country [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=525.72s)]
*  to retaliate against the country that just openly bombed them and boasted about it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  And if they go and attack U.S. troops or U.S. bases or American citizens or U.S. interests or close [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=540.2s)]
*  the straight-up harmoots, obviously it's going to lead to much greater U.S. involvement in this war. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  We're going to be enmeshed. We already are enmeshed in Israel's war with Iran. Once you go and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=549.8s)]
*  bomb a country that Israel is at war against, you are now a belligerent in that conflict by definition. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=555.4s)]
*  The question is whether it's going to be another protracted, enduring Middle East war that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  escalates, that expands, and if the Iranians do any of the retaliation that they've been promising [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=568.68s)]
*  able to do leading up to the U.S. involvement that they're now battling to do after the U.S. bombing, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=574.76s)]
*  of course the United States will then have to respond and we will be in a multifaceted war [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=581.48s)]
*  with Iran or bombing at least, but we'd have to protect our bases and our troops in the places [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=585.4s)]
*  where Iran has the ability to attack. And so any of you who are thinking, oh, I'm not that worried, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=591.56s)]
*  this is just a one-night, 10-minute precision bombing campaign, I hope you're right, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=595.8s)]
*  but there's no way for you to be certain. So let's go over just a few of the facts here because, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=601.88s)]
*  as always, whenever the United States starts a war or is about to start a war, I think, and I don't [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=607.1600000000001s)]
*  even consider this to be necessarily a negative attribute, Americans want to believe that their [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=613.08s)]
*  government has done the right thing. Nobody likes to think of their country or their government [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=617.96s)]
*  as being the villain or the aggressor or the warmongers, and so there's a natural tendency [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=622.5200000000001s)]
*  for the people of that country to unite behind their leadership. We see it over and over. Every [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=630.68s)]
*  time there's a new war, people unite behind the leadership. The whole country, half the country, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  heated George W. Bush's guts. They thought that he stole the 2000 election. They thought he was an [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=641.0s)]
*  idiot, a moron, and then after 9-11 he had sky-high approval ratings of 90 percent, then 80 percent, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=645.0s)]
*  70 percent, and endured for quite a while when the Iraq war started, still 70 percent approval. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=650.1999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, that's happening in Iran, too. Lots of people who dislike the regime, who are dissatisfied [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=654.52s)]
*  with their government, are now going to have national pride and unify behind their government [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=658.6s)]
*  and its response. So when that happens, the government knows that it can just feed people [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=665.8s)]
*  some propaganda. It doesn't have to be true. It doesn't matter if it's true. Usually it's not true. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=671.24s)]
*  And people are so eager to get behind the government, they just immediately embrace it, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=674.84s)]
*  no critical thinking, no questioning of it. And so, you know, it's a very, very, very, very [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=678.36s)]
*  critical thinking, no questioning of it. So let's just go over a couple, some key facts here. First [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=682.84s)]
*  of all, Iran is now the, is now the eighth country, eighth Muslim country, Muslim majority country, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=688.6s)]
*  that the United States of America has bombed and or invaded, but bombed in the last 15 years. So [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=702.44s)]
*  from Obama to Trump to Biden to Trump, we have now bombed eight different [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=710.2s)]
*  Muslim majority countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Pakistan, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=718.44s)]
*  and now Iran. I think that might have been seven. I think I might have missed one. Let's just get that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  list here right, because I think it's such an important point to consider. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=736.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan, and Yemen, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=746.04s)]
*  and now Iran. So that's eight countries. In 2016, Obama's last year in office, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=751.48s)]
*  he bombed all seven of those countries, and now Trump has added Iran to the list. So that's eight [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  different countries the United States has bombed in that region, and just in the last 15 years alone. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=765.0s)]
*  And so if Iran retaliates, or if there's an attack on the U.S. homeland avenging these bombings or [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=772.2s)]
*  some other bombings, please just don't anybody go around saying, why did they hate us? Islam is a [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=779.64s)]
*  religion of violence and extremism. What kind of people anywhere would accept constant bombing in [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=785.08s)]
*  multiple countries for 15 years? And it's gone on long before that, Trump just taking the most [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=792.04s)]
*  consolidated recent time and do nothing. Say, oh, they don't mind the United States. Yes, they bomb [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  us frequently. They kill lots of innocent people. They kill lots of civilians. They try and pose on [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=803.64s)]
*  us their will, but they're okay. Obviously, there's going to be a huge amount of anti-American hatred, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=810.92s)]
*  not just that, but a desire for vengeance. Eight different Muslim majority countries in 15 years [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=817.8s)]
*  alone. Actually, eight since 2016, since Obama bombed seven of them in 2016 alone with a lot of [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=823.0s)]
*  bombs, and now Trump added Iran to the list. Secondly, this is yet another war where the United [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=830.28s)]
*  States is fighting alongside Israel and against Israel's enemy. We've shown you many, many times, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=839.88s)]
*  you can go back decades, how the greatest wish the United States had, that Israel had, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=848.4399999999999s)]
*  was to lure the United States into a war against Iran. That has been the North Star, the cherry on [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=853.88s)]
*  top of their cake. Prior to the Red War in Iraq, Benjamin Netanyahu came to the United States in [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=860.12s)]
*  2002 and not only said, you should attack Iraq, you should depose Saddam Hussein. He has a nuclear [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=866.04s)]
*  weapon or is about to get one, the same lie as now. But also, if you do that, peace and prosperity [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=872.12s)]
*  and stability and tranquility, I guarantee you, he said, with that word, guarantee will spread [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=878.52s)]
*  throughout the region. As we know, all of that was a lie. None of that happened. Even Tony Blair, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  one of the biggest advocates for the war in Iraq, admits that the removal of Saddam Hussein [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=888.92s)]
*  is what gave rise to ISIS, that power vacuum that we created right in the middle of that region. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=892.6s)]
*  There's always unanticipated consequences, usually very negative ones, even if you decide you're [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=898.84s)]
*  going to fight a limited war. And there are tons of people already who are saying, we want a regime [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=903.24s)]
*  change war. But it doesn't mean Israel manipulated Trump into doing this. This was Donald Trump's [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=908.84s)]
*  decision. No matter how much you think Israel is to blame or you think that Israel is to blame, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=914.12s)]
*  or you think that I'm just going to take care of some [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=922.76s)]
*  chat disruptors. And I'll get right back to this point. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=933.72s)]
*  All right. So when I say that this is an example of the United States going to war with Israel, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=941.48s)]
*  fighting against Israel's enemies at Israel's behest, it doesn't mean that the Israelis [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=948.28s)]
*  hypnotize Trump. It's just a fact that we continuously fight words that Israel wants us [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=954.28s)]
*  to fight against their enemies. There's a memo that Netanyahu wrote back in 1995, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=959.64s)]
*  laying out all the countries he wanted the United States to go to war against. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=969.16s)]
*  There's a memo that circulated after 9-11 in the Pentagon that Wesley Clark said that he saw, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=972.6800000000001s)]
*  and both of those called for the United States to depose the governments of eight different [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  countries, including Iraq and Syria and Libya. And it went down the list, all of which we've done, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=983.96s)]
*  all of which we've been able to do, and we've been able to do, and we've been able to do, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=993.8000000000001s)]
*  and it went down the list, all of which we've done, all of which we bombed, all of which we [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=999.0s)]
*  changed the government of, and Iran was always the last one. That was the Israeli dream for the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1003.32s)]
*  United States to go to war, transform the region in its favor. So this war is a war that serves [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1008.12s)]
*  Israeli interests that the Israelis were demanding we fight. Maybe that was just a coincidence. Maybe [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1015.48s)]
*  it's a huge coincidence that we keep fighting wars against Israel's enemies and wars that Israel [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1021.08s)]
*  demands or requests that we fight, but this is yet another one. And one of Trump's biggest [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1026.36s)]
*  donors was Mary Madelson, who was born in Israel, is Israeli. She became an American citizen to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1034.6799999999998s)]
*  marry the multi-billionaire Sheldon Adelson, but Trump himself said, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1041.4799999999998s)]
*  they come into the White House more than anybody else and always ask for things for Israel, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1045.08s)]
*  and I always give them things for Israel. And in fact, they give them even more than they asked. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1048.9199999999998s)]
*  Trump boasted before the election, he was the most pro-Israel president [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1052.92s)]
*  ever, that he would give Israel everything it wanted. He actually went before groups and said, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1056.76s)]
*  we're going to make Israel great again and the United States great again. So none of this has [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1061.8000000000002s)]
*  been hidden, even though it was surrounded by a huge amount of rhetoric about how we're going to [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1067.0800000000002s)]
*  vanquish the neoconservatives, about how neoconservatism is a rotted and dangerous [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1072.6000000000001s)]
*  ideology that Trump said he was going to expunge from the Republican Party and expunge from the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1078.68s)]
*  country. When Israel wants something, Israel gets it. We're paying and foreign-arming their war in [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1083.3200000000002s)]
*  Gaza. We're letting them annex the West Bank. We let them and paid for them and armed them to [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1090.92s)]
*  take land from both Lebanon and Syria. And now they were demanding that we join them in this war [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1098.68s)]
*  that they started against Iran. And of course, we did it. Now, I don't think it absolves Trump in [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1106.28s)]
*  any way, but it just is a fact that we fight wars in the Middle East constantly at the behest of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1111.96s)]
*  and in service to Israel, even if there's an argument that, oh, it's good for our country as [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1119.24s)]
*  well, like the Iraq war was. I wanted a couple of points about some of the propaganda that has been [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1123.6399999999999s)]
*  issued by the U.S. government, by Trump supporters that have gotten even, there's a lot of Trump [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1131.72s)]
*  supporters, MAGA people, who have long identified as Miss America First, who spent months [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1140.1200000000001s)]
*  warning that a war with Iran would be extremely dangerous, that it would be a violation of [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1146.84s)]
*  everything Trump promised. And overnight, the vast majority of them overnight instantly transformed [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1150.68s)]
*  into cheerleaders for what Trump did here. They didn't even pretend. They just said, yeah, I know [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1158.36s)]
*  I've been jumping up and down, banging on the table, saying that any attack on Iran would be [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1164.76s)]
*  a violation of MAGA's principles of what Trump promised. It would be extremely dangerous and [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1169.6399999999999s)]
*  contrary to our country's interests. And the minute Trump goes and does it, they're handed [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1173.24s)]
*  a bunch of propagandistic lines to use, which they all start repeating, not all, but most, to say, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1178.4399999999998s)]
*  I think President Trump did the right thing. I trust President Trump. So let's go over a couple [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1184.2s)]
*  of those. First of all, President Trump said last night at the White House, flanked by his [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1189.16s)]
*  JD Vance and Marco Rubio and Pete Hagstaff, he said that the United States just succeeded in [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1195.0800000000002s)]
*  quote, completely obliterating Iran's nuclear program. President Trump would have no way of [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1201.32s)]
*  knowing that. There's no damages has been done at these sites. Some of them are buried very far [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1211.0s)]
*  underground, even with bunker busters. I'm sure they were damaged. They might have been severely [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1216.52s)]
*  damaged, but there's no way, especially at Forto, to know whether it's been actually destroyed. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1221.8s)]
*  On top of that, nobody has any idea whether there are other facilities that Iran has where they're [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1229.48s)]
*  enriching uranium and working on centrifuges, or whether this attack was telegraphed enough [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1234.68s)]
*  that Iran was able to move out some meaningful amount of enriched uranium and centrifuges and [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1243.48s)]
*  brought it somewhere else. All of those things are very possible. So this idea that we've [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1249.4s)]
*  completely obliterated Iran's nuclear program, I guess it could be true, but it also might not [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1254.1200000000001s)]
*  be true. And when the government says things, asserts things with no evidence in war, anybody [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1262.44s)]
*  who's over the age of 20 should know enough that you don't just blindly trust what the government [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1267.88s)]
*  tells you, even if you love the president. Because all governments lie in war, they use [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1275.0s)]
*  disinformation of war, they use disinformation to confuse the other side, they use it to manipulate [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1280.44s)]
*  public opinion globally, and they especially use it to manipulate domestic opinion. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1285.56s)]
*  I'm sure they impeded the nuclear program some, they've killed some scientists, they, I'm sure, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1292.44s)]
*  significantly damaged at least some of these facilities if not all. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1299.96s)]
*  But the idea that Iran is just their nuclear program has been eliminated, that is close to laughable. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1303.8s)]
*  But here's the lie that I really want to most focus on, because ultimately this is what is [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1310.76s)]
*  justifying all of this. There are actually two lies that form the core lie itself. So [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1315.64s)]
*  in 2002 and 2003, the reason Americans were convinced to support the war in Iraq is because [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1325.16s)]
*  we were told that Iran had biological weapons and chemical weapons and either had nuclear weapons, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1330.2800000000002s)]
*  Dick Cheney on Meet the Press said that Iran had reconstituted nuclear weapons or were about to get [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1338.92s)]
*  nuclear weapons. And then as far as the question is, well, okay, well, what is Iran going to do [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1344.68s)]
*  with them? They don't have the missile capability to send to the United States, they don't have the [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1350.52s)]
*  ability to, they don't have the ability to, to, to shoot them, we're on a warhead, they can't weaponize [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1355.16s)]
*  them. The argument was, oh, they're going to hand them to Al Qaeda. Jeffrey Goldberg wrote several [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1368.44s)]
*  articles with the lie that some who say it was going to close the alliance with Al Qaeda, they [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1373.48s)]
*  were going to just give them to Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda was going to take them to the United States [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1377.24s)]
*  and bomb them. And when people said, well, a lot of countries say that's not true, the evidence seems [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1380.92s)]
*  very dubious. They sent Colin Powell to the UN using his credibility, holding up those [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1389.24s)]
*  moronic test tubes with some substance inside of them, some grainy satellite programs, and a lot [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1394.68s)]
*  of people got convinced. Oh, yeah, they definitely have a nuclear weapons program. If they don't [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1398.76s)]
*  already have nuclear weapons, we absolutely need to take them out. So, so then the question is, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1404.2s)]
*  well, if they were lying then, as we know that they are, then why would people be so willing [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1412.2s)]
*  to believe that Iran was getting close to a nuclear weapons program, that they had made the [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1421.4s)]
*  decision to try and weaponize enriched uranium into a nuclear weapon? And that question is [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1425.24s)]
*  particularly pressing. Why are people willing to believe this when we all listen to Tulsi Gabbard [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1431.64s)]
*  as director of national intelligence, even though she's trying now to walk it back and pretend she [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1435.48s)]
*  didn't say it, you can listen to the video, she said it verbatim, that the best assessment of the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1439.48s)]
*  intelligence community, this was at the end of March, three months ago, is that Iran has not [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1445.32s)]
*  reactivated their program to acquire nuclear weapons, that the Aetola has not made a decision [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1450.84s)]
*  to seek to develop nuclear weapons, that they suspended that program back in 2003, and nothing [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1456.6799999999998s)]
*  has changed since then. And yet here we have enormous amounts of people who are just willing to [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1463.24s)]
*  believe that Iran was about to get nuclear weapons based on absolutely nothing, even though they know [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1474.4399999999998s)]
*  that just 20 years ago the American government lied in the same exact way for a neighboring [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1480.12s)]
*  country to justify a war there. Why are so many people believing this? And when asked, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1484.28s)]
*  President Pete Hex, after President Trump, like what are you relying on Israel, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1491.8s)]
*  given that you're rejecting the assessment of your own intelligence community, and by the way, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1496.84s)]
*  the U.S. knowledge community is not trustworthy, but Trump now has the people like Tulsi Gabbard [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1500.6s)]
*  in charge of it that he picked, John Ratcliffe of the CIA, that were going to reform these agencies, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1504.6799999999998s)]
*  that were going to make them reliable. But even when his own hand-picked DNI, whom he fought for, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1511.1599999999999s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard says there's no active nuclear weapons program, Trump decides, oh yeah, I'm just [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1515.56s)]
*  telling you that's not true, I'm telling you I've seen intel that they were about to get nuclear [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1520.76s)]
*  weapons, where does that come from? From Netanyahu, from Israel? From where? And why aren't people [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1524.52s)]
*  more skeptical of that? That's the whole pretext for why this bombing was necessary. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1530.6s)]
*  The other, I want to get back to that in a second as well, which is, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1537.8799999999999s)]
*  which is, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1546.28s)]
*  is this idea that, oh, Trump and the U.S. wanted so badly to [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1547.0s)]
*  enrich, to reach an agreement with Iran and wanted to [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1561.24s)]
*  reach a deal so badly that would have avoided the need for this, he was really hoping to diplomatically [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1570.28s)]
*  resolve all of this at the negotiating table, but Iran, they just wouldn't do it. They just refused. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1578.84s)]
*  The U.S. wanted so badly, Trump was trying so hard to avert this, and Iran said nope, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1588.04s)]
*  we're not going to do a deal, we don't want your deal. I think this is a cruel, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1592.84s)]
*  I think this is a crucial point to realize, even though it seems detailed and technical, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1598.2800000000002s)]
*  it's really not, it's central to everything that we're talking about here, which is, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1604.0400000000002s)]
*  the whole idea of the Iranian nuclear program is that the U.S. has always said, even the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1609.88s)]
*  Trump administration in the first term has said, that, that, that Iran has the right to obtain [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1615.8000000000002s)]
*  to, to develop a nuclear energy program. Not the right to develop a nuclear weapon, but the right [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1627.56s)]
*  to develop a nuclear energy program. And this, the reason Iran has that right is because unlike [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1633.8s)]
*  Israel, they're actually a signatory to the nuclear nonproliferation treatment, and the whole point [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1639.8s)]
*  of that treaty, the nonproliferation treaty, was to tell countries that don't yet have nuclear weapons, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1643.56s)]
*  you're permitted to have nuclear energy, you didn't have nuclear weapons, so they have the [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1650.84s)]
*  right under these conventions and treaties, like every country does, to have a nuclear weapons [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1653.96s)]
*  program. Cardozo, just trying to get that noise turned off, the farming noise that I [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1658.68s)]
*  warned you about at the start. So, the idea is always that Iran can have a nuclear energy program, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1675.88s)]
*  and even though they're an oil-rich country, they still want nuclear energy to power their [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1683.64s)]
*  country so that they can sell their oil, which feeds their economy, rather than have to consume [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1687.16s)]
*  their oil. That's the reason that they want nuclear energy and have been using nuclear energy for [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIQSO8goIQ&t=1693.16s)]
