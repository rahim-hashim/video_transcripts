# Who Is GOP Mega-Donor Miriam Adelson & What Does She Want?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg)
*  One of the central facts of American political life that cannot be denied is that income [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=0.0s)]
*  inequality has massively increased. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=11.1s)]
*  It was already quite extreme prior to the pandemic, but during the pandemic, a huge [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=13.46s)]
*  number of small businesses disappeared and the mega corporations and the multi billionaires [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=17.88s)]
*  who own and control them consolidated a huge amount of commerce in their hands, especially [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=22.88s)]
*  when people felt they couldn't go outside. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=29.2s)]
*  As a result, those people got even richer and the gap between the richest people in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=31.48s)]
*  our country and pretty much everybody else grew even further. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=34.92s)]
*  Now, when that happens and lots of people have different opinions about to what extent [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=38.32s)]
*  that inequality should be able to grow, maybe it should be able to grow for as much as it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  wants and can, maybe the government should intervene in some way, whatever your view [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=48.04s)]
*  on that is, there's no question and even the founders often stress this, that if income [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=52.08s)]
*  inequality becomes too large, if wealth inequality becomes too great, then inevitably it will [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=56.68s)]
*  spill over, said the founders, people like Thomas Paine, even Thomas Jefferson talked [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=62.96s)]
*  about this, it will spill over, that inequality will, into the realm of political rights and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=66.92s)]
*  our political processes which are intended to be not based on who has greater wealth, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  but just equal among every citizen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=76.8s)]
*  And that is absolutely what has been happening over the last 20 to 30 years. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=79.64s)]
*  I actually talked on the after show yesterday about my original support in 2010 for the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=82.96s)]
*  majority ruling in Citizens United on First Amendment grounds and I explained why I still [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=89.16s)]
*  agree with that ruling, but nonetheless that doesn't mean simply because I oppose First [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Amendment restrictions as a solution, that this is not a huge problem. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  It is a massive problem, it's getting bigger and it's essentially rendering in some cases [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=100.32s)]
*  our democracy illusory because even the politicians who want to be the most independent, want [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=105.96s)]
*  to be the most heterodox, the most anti-establishment end up relying on just a handful of multi-billionaires [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=111.12s)]
*  who finance their campaign with gargantuan sums of money. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=118.12s)]
*  They then feel captive to those people and their agenda even if they don't necessarily [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  want to follow or agree with that agenda and then even once the election is over, it's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=125.2s)]
*  the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest people who pay for the lobbyists and pay for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=129.76s)]
*  the processes that shape the actual laws that Congress passes, often the same people who [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=133.44s)]
*  finance it getting the same outcomes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=138.24s)]
*  Now one of the people who has broken records this year in terms of the amount of money [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  she has given to support a single candidate, Donald Trump, by donating $100 million to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=146.44s)]
*  a super PAC that is supposed to be independent of the campaign but that supports Trump's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=151.88s)]
*  election is named Miriam Adelson and she is Israeli born, she spent a lot of her life, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=156.12s)]
*  most of her life as an Israeli citizen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  She never gave up her Israeli citizenship, she's now also an American citizen by virtue [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=165.84s)]
*  having married her multi-billionaire husband in 1991 and here's the Wall Street Journal [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=169.84s)]
*  yesterday explaining exactly what it is that she's doing in this election cycle. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=175.12s)]
*  Quote, conservative donor Miriam Adelson gives a super PAC supporting Donald Trump $95 million. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  Quote, Adelson, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump in 2018, supplied [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=185.24s)]
*  all but $81,000 of the money that the President Preserve America PAC took in during the third [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=191.56s)]
*  quarter according to the filing Tuesday with the FEC, the Federal Election Commission. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  And in reality ended up being $100 million, she had given $5 million in seed money to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  that PAC so in total she did what she promised she would do which is donate $100 million [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=205.48s)]
*  to a super PAC trying to elect Donald Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=211.44s)]
*  And you see mega donors on both sides, on both parties getting closer and closer to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=215.64s)]
*  that number as well. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  And Leon Musk has given something similar in that same universe, though somewhat less [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=222.0s)]
*  and there's plenty of billionaires funding the Democratic Party and along have been including [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=227.12s)]
*  one that we'll talk about who's very similar in trajectory and belief to Miriam Adelson [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=230.8s)]
*  but her wealth comes from an inheritance that she received when her husband whom she married [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  later in his life, Sheldon Adelson died at the age of 87 back in 2021 as the Financial [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=244.74s)]
*  Times reported then, U.S. casino magnate and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson dies [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=250.72s)]
*  at 87. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=255.76s)]
*  Billionaire helped transform gaming hubs and wield influence over U.S. and Israeli politics. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=257.56s)]
*  Adelson was the billionaire founder of Las Vegas Sands and is credited with transforming [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=262.52s)]
*  the cities of Las Vegas and Macau into gaming and resort destinations. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=266.94s)]
*  He leveraged his vast wealth to exert social and political influence on causes from Jewish [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=271.28s)]
*  affairs to combating opioid addiction, bought regional newspapers in Nevada and Israel and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=275.98s)]
*  befriended world leaders around the globe. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=282.1s)]
*  And I should say that Miriam Adelson is actually a physician. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=283.86s)]
*  She became a physician, an emergency room physician but then also an internist prior [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=287.06s)]
*  to marrying Sheldon Adelson and it's true that her specialty before she married him [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  was working on opioid addicts in particular and the physiological struggles they face [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  both in terms of their addiction and then withdrawing from it so that's a very genuine [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=302.8s)]
*  cause that both of them supported. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  But quote, most recently Adelson was a close confidant of U.S. President Donald Trump and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=309.22s)]
*  wielded power behind the scenes including successfully urging Mr. Trump to push for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=317.66s)]
*  Adelson and his wife Miriam were among the deepest pocketed and most reliable donors [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=321.88s)]
*  to Republican political candidates in recent years as the single largest Republican donor [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=325.8s)]
*  in the 2012 election cycle. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=330.72s)]
*  Adelson's endorsement of Mr. Trump for president early in the 2016 campaign helped accelerate [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=332.76000000000005s)]
*  the New York businessman's route to the White House. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=337.72s)]
*  The couple maintained their position in the upper echelon of Republican donors through [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=340.44000000000005s)]
*  subsequent elections including the 2018 midterms. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=343.92s)]
*  The Center for Responsive Politics which tracks campaign contributions ranked the Adelson's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=347.86s)]
*  as the largest individual donors of the 2020 election cycle given almost $220 million all [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  of it to Republicans. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  Adelson helped support Ariel University built on a settlement deep inside the occupied West [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=360.52s)]
*  Bank and was a guest of honor at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in 2019. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=365.56s)]
*  At the ceremony American and Israeli dignitaries made a beeline for him and his wife who is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=370.2s)]
*  now expected to take over his pro-Israel philanthropy and that's exactly what she has done. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  She's become arguably the single most influential person in financing one of the candidates [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=379.88s)]
*  in this election cycle. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=386.46s)]
*  Now as I said I think anytime billionaires are donating massive amounts of wealth and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=387.52s)]
*  it's legal for them to do it and they're not doing anything wrong but I think our political [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=394.24s)]
*  liberties and our political system gets corrupted by having a handful, a tiny number of people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  be able to basically mold and shape the political parties and candidates to their agenda. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=406.08s)]
*  Oftentimes having both political parties mold to their agenda through the use of their [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  vast wealth, just multi-billions of dollars and flowing in an unlimited way. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=417.3s)]
*  She could have given a billion dollars to Trump if she wanted. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=421.22s)]
*  There are no limits on how much you can give but it's particularly strange when the people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=424.90000000000003s)]
*  who are doing the most to shape your politics weren't born in the United States and have [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  a citizenship in a country that is not the United States which is in Mary Madelson's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=438.16s)]
*  case in Israel. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=443.22s)]
*  She is an Israeli citizen. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=444.22s)]
*  That's where she was born. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=445.22s)]
*  And where she goes around saying quite unabashedly and proudly that her primary political issue [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=448.14000000000004s)]
*  is making sure the United States does everything Israel wants and needs to serve the interests [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=451.82000000000005s)]
*  of Israel and the Israeli people. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=456.26000000000005s)]
*  And just imagine if we had an oligarchical Russian couple spending hundreds of millions [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=459.26000000000005s)]
*  of dollars every year in our election cycle while maintaining Russian citizenship with [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=466.66s)]
*  the sole overarching goal of making sure the United States government and its policies [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=472.22s)]
*  serves the interests of the Russian people. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=477.04s)]
*  Or imagine any country sending one of their wealthiest people to just become an American [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=479.42s)]
*  citizen and pour hundreds of millions of dollars into our policies and into our politicians [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=485.46000000000004s)]
*  to ensure that those politicians and those parties stay loyal and faithful to the interests [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=491.02000000000004s)]
*  of the other country to which they have citizenship and therefore loyalty where they were born. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=496.76000000000005s)]
*  It would never be acceptable in any other instance other than a citizen of Israel exercising [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=502.86s)]
*  this amount of power in this way. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=508.64000000000004s)]
*  Here from Heretz, the Israeli newspaper in January 2021, quote, the fate of Adelson's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=511.20000000000005s)]
*  political empire lies in the hands of his Israeli widow Miriam. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=516.1s)]
*  And that's how she's always referred to us. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=519.32s)]
*  The Israeli Miriam Adelson, his Israeli widow, quote, Miriam Adelson was often credited with [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=522.6s)]
*  increasing the late Sheldon Adelson's interest in Israel. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=527.72s)]
*  Right-wing politicians will be watching to see what happens next. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=531.16s)]

*  to the right. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=625.0s)]

*  such massive contributions to causes like the Holocaust Museum and Memorial, the Birthright [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=630.1400000000001s)]

*  publisher. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=659.6s)]
*  So, they weren't just using their massive wealth inside the United States to ensure [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=660.6s)]

*  Adelson both want. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=690.84s)]
*  That's why he was funding settlements deep within the West Bank, because those settlements, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=692.12s)]
*  those Israeli settlements, make a two-state solution impossible. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=697.12s)]

*  Here is the New York Times who did a profile on Miriam Adelson when she announced her intent [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=707.4599999999999s)]
*  to spend $100 million on a pro-Trump super PAC. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=711.8199999999999s)]

*  Miriam Adelson long operated in the shadow of her powerful husband, Sheldon Adelson. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  Now after her death, she is playing in politics as a sole practitioner for the first time. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=726.54s)]
*  The article reads, quote, Dr. Adelson is poised to become one of the biggest donors in the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=731.52s)]
*  presidential election and if Mr. Trump wins, one of the most powerful private citizens [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=736.04s)]
*  with the say in American foreign policy. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=740.9599999999999s)]
*  Fiercely hawkish on Israel, she was deeply unnerved by the Hamas attacks on October 7th [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=743.76s)]
*  and would likely shape a second Trump administration's posture on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=748.88s)]
*  Now I have questions about whether that's true, but of course the New York Times says [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=754.6s)]
*  it wants to convince people that it is and certainly while I have more doubts and questions, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=759.24s)]
*  obviously it's possible, very possible that if you give one candidate $100 million to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=766.2s)]
*  get them elected and then they go around with you everywhere promising to give you everything [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=772.7s)]

*  some debt. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=781.78s)]
*  People don't spend $100 million and expect to get nothing in return. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=782.86s)]
*  The article goes on, quote, she is in some ways a political carbon copy of her husband, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=786.6999999999999s)]
*  intensely pro-Israel, rabidly partisan and a believer in the nobility of using her money [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=791.1s)]
*  north of $30 billion and her media empire to buy, influence and shape the world, but [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=796.62s)]
*  she is also, by the accounts of people who have pitched her, a tougher ask. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=801.88s)]
*  She is seen as more cerebral and disciplined than her husband, whereas Mr. Adelson enjoyed [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  the game of politics and obsessed over tactics. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=810.94s)]
*  He wasn't above editing the script of the advertisement, one of the people said. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=813.86s)]
*  She is more driven by whatever is happening in America and Israeli news. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=817.84s)]
*  Her fervor for Mr. Trump, some of his allies say, actually exceeds her late husband's. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=821.46s)]
*  At one point she suggested adding a, quote, book of Trump to the Bible. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=826.58s)]
*  Her Israeli nationalism has tethered her to Mr. Trump, especially since October 7th. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=831.24s)]
*  Her Israeli nationalism is what is fueling her desire and her attempt and her success, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=838.9799999999999s)]
*  given the virtually incomparable walls she has. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=846.3399999999999s)]
*  There are only a few people on the planet richer than she. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=848.9399999999999s)]
*  That's what's driving her attempt to shape American politics, to shape the Republican [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=853.06s)]
*  Party. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=856.06s)]
*  And like I said, there are plenty of people doing exactly the same thing on the Democratic [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=857.06s)]
*  side, not just funding them with their billionaire wealth, but funding them for the same goal, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=861.78s)]
*  the same purpose, the same policy in mind, to make sure the Democratic Party also stays [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=867.1s)]
*  aligned with and loyal to the state of Israel. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=870.3s)]
*  Now the Adelsons have not just been funding Trump, they've been funding the Republican [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=874.58s)]
*  Party for many years with incomparable levels of donations and wealth. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=878.46s)]
*  And they make very clear that in order to get their money, the main hoop that you have [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=885.34s)]
*  to jump through is promising repeatedly that you will be loyal to Israel and to prove that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=890.9399999999999s)]
*  you actually mean it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=895.1600000000001s)]
*  And if you're running for president, especially in the Republican Party, but also in the Democratic [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=896.96s)]
*  Party, your tendency politically is that you're going to pledge loyalty to Israel. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=900.8000000000001s)]

*  What will she expect in return? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1108.84s)]
*  Beyond unconditional support for the Israel-Hamas war, one can assume she'll press for the unfinished [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1111.12s)]
*  items of Trump's Israel agenda from the last term. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1116.0s)]
*  At the top of that list, Israel annexing the West Bank and the U.S. recognizing Israeli [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1119.24s)]
*  sovereignty there, something that, again, even the most devoutly pro-Israel presidents [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1125.24s)]

*  national security that Israel not annex the West Bank because annexing the West Bank means [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1146.2s)]
*  there would never be a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which causes a great deal of anti-American [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1150.4s)]

*  they're seen supporting Israel when the Palestinians don't have a homeland. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1165.36s)]
*  Trump said on camera, quote, I'm a very loyal person. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1170.12s)]
*  I've been the best president in history to Israel by a factor of 10 because all the things [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1173.4799999999998s)]
*  I do, the embassy, Jerusalem being the capital, then you have Golan Heights. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  Nobody ever thought that was going to be possible. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1181.9199999999998s)]
*  I did that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1183.84s)]
*  Miriam Adelson, as I said, she doesn't give away her money for free. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1186.76s)]
*  She gets everything she wants. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1192.1599999999999s)]
*  We're just one symbolic president that Trump gave her in November of 2018. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1193.52s)]
*  He gave her the Medal of Honor, the highest honor that an American, a private American [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1199.84s)]
*  citizen can receive. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1205.12s)]
*  Now, this is something that Mary Adelson is very proud of. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1223.52s)]
*  She loves to go around and boast of all the things she made Trump do for her and for Israel. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1237.16s)]
*  She goes around handing him buckets of money, and then she stands up and she says, look [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1244.72s)]
*  at all the things that I got him to do to Israel and look at all the things he's going [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1249.04s)]
*  to give to Israel if he's elected. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1251.72s)]
*  Here is Miriam Adelson in October, August of this year at a Trump rally speaking with [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1255.16s)]
*  both American and Israeli flags behind her. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1263.0s)]
*  That president is Donald Trump. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1266.2s)]
*  He promised to recognize Jerusalem and to move the embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1273.52s)]
*  He promised to withdraw from Iran's nuclear deal and promised to bring peace between [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1281.52s)]
*  Israel and Arab nations. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1298.56s)]
*  And all of this he did in his first term while battling COVID pandemic, race riots, and the [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1302.52s)]
*  liberal media. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1331.64s)]
*  Now, I want to tell you, politicians make promises. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1334.24s)]
*  Real leaders keep promises. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1342.0s)]
*  So that's just her boasting of how she used her money to extract a bunch of commitments [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1350.68s)]
*  from Trump to benefit Israel. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1355.5s)]
*  And she says even while the country was suffering from COVID, even while he was battling the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1357.92s)]
*  liberal media, he still found time to do all these things we demanded that he do and that [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1362.5600000000002s)]
*  he promised he would do for Israel in exchange for our money. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1366.3200000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump himself speaking last month before the Israeli American Council almost [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1369.6000000000001s)]
*  mocked the situation in the very Trumpian style that he has basically saying, you know [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1376.1200000000001s)]
*  what? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1382.2s)]
*  The Adelson's, there's no giving them enough. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1383.2s)]
*  There's no satiating them. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1387.24s)]
*  Whatever you give them, whatever you give to Israel, they come back and want more and [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1389.32s)]
*  more and more. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1392.4399999999998s)]
*  And he basically said, and that's what I'm going to do for them. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  Here's him speaking at this event where she was also president. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1395.0s)]
*  Just as I promised, I recognized Israel's eternal capital and opened the American embassy [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1399.48s)]
*  in Jerusalem. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1405.1999999999998s)]
*  Jerusalem became the capital. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1406.1999999999998s)]
*  I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1409.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, Muriam and Sheldon would come into the White House, probably almost more than [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1416.88s)]
*  anybody outside of people that work there. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1423.0s)]
*  And they were always after and as soon as I give them something always for Israel, as [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1427.08s)]
*  soon as I give them something, they'd want something else. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1431.08s)]
*  I said, give me a couple of weeks, will you please? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1433.28s)]
*  But I gave them the Golan Heights and they never even asked for it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1437.0s)]
*  You know, for 72 years, they've been trying to do the Golan Heights, right? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1439.76s)]
*  And even Sheldon didn't have the nerve. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1445.3600000000001s)]
*  But I said, you know what? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1447.92s)]
*  I said to David Friedman, give me a quick lesson, like five minutes or less on the Golan [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1449.52s)]
*  Heights. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1453.72s)]
*  And he did. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1454.72s)]
*  And I said, let's do it. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1455.72s)]
*  We got it done in about 15 minutes. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1456.72s)]
*  So just to be clear, what Trump's version of events is, is that he had no idea what [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1459.72s)]
*  the Golan Heights was. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1465.76s)]
*  He didn't know anything about it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1466.76s)]
*  It's a disputed territory that the Syrians, the Lebanese, and Israelis claim belongs to [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1468.88s)]
*  them. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1475.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a very strategic part of land, is very strategic part of land. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1476.6000000000001s)]
*  And Israel has been arguing with their neighbors over who controls the Golan Heights. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1481.48s)]
*  It's something that Israel is occupying and wants to take fully. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1485.0s)]
*  And Trump said, here's what I did. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1488.3200000000002s)]
*  I asked David Friedman, who was his ambassador, US ambassador to Israel, to give him a five [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  minute lesson. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1494.7600000000002s)]
*  David Friedman is one of the most fanatical Zionists you will ever find. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1495.76s)]
*  And whatever David Friedman told him about the Golan Heights and what it is, Trump immediately [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1499.04s)]
*  says that he voluntarily stood up and announced to do something for Israel that not even Sheldon [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1503.52s)]
*  Adelson had the nerve to ask for, which is to just hand over the Golan Heights to Israel, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1509.24s)]
*  to just recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1512.96s)]
*  And Mary Maddelson, that was one of the things that she listed as something he promised the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1516.68s)]
*  Adelson's and then followed through on. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1521.12s)]
*  Now, one of the things that the Adelson's have been doing for a long time is recognizing [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1523.68s)]
*  what they regard as the danger on American college campuses and the growing belief among [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1528.76s)]
*  young Americans and young college students that US support for Israel is damaging to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1536.4s)]
*  our interest and is also immoral. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1541.76s)]
*  And back in 2018, even before that, the Adelson's announced that they were going to invest massive [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1544.88s)]
*  funding into battling anti-Israel sentiment on American colleges campuses. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1550.12s)]
*  From the Times of Israel in August of 2018, quote, Adelson backed college activist group [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1555.1599999999999s)]
*  to double presence to 80 campuses. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1559.8s)]
*  The McAfee Task Force, which works to counter the BDS movement at universities, will also [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1562.3999999999999s)]
*  begin operating in Canada for the first time. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1566.76s)]
*  So one of the things they've been wanting to do is to strip away criticism of Israel [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1568.9599999999998s)]
*  on American college campuses and make sure that pro-Israel sentiment reigns there as [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1573.2399999999998s)]
*  well, something that we saw manifest this year over the controversies on college campuses. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1577.84s)]
*  Now, just to be clear about one thing, although the decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1582.32s)]
*  had long been considered a sort of radical pro-Israel move, one that most of the world [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1593.76s)]
*  was against because Jerusalem is considered disputed and was supposed to be part of the [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1600.76s)]
*  settlement that would bring peace to the Israelis and Palestinians by carving up that land and [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1606.8s)]
*  having some be part of the Israeli state and some being part of the Palestinian state because [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1611.24s)]
*  Jerusalem was disputed. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1615.4399999999998s)]
*  Recognizing it as Israel's capital, putting your embassy there is essentially taking it [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1619.0s)]
*  for Israel and handing over to them, which is something that Donald Trump promised the [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1622.1999999999998s)]
*  Adelson's he would do and then did. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1625.6399999999999s)]
*  And the Democrats were about to try and turn this into some sort of controversy until they [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1628.24s)]
*  realized that the top level leadership of the Democratic Party also supported the movement [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1631.64s)]
*  of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and the recognition of Jerusalem as the [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1637.76s)]
*  Israeli capital. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1642.44s)]
*  Here from National Review in May of 2018, quote, Charles Chuck Schumer praises Trump [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1643.44s)]
*  for the embassy move. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1648.48s)]
*  Quote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, praised President Trump [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  Monday for his, quote, long overdue relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1653.72s)]
*  to Jerusalem. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1658.08s)]
*  Quote, it's a long overdue move because we have moved our embassy to Jerusalem, he said [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1659.08s)]
*  in a statement, quote, every nation should have the right to choose its capital. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1664.52s)]
*  I sponsored legislation to do this two decades ago and I applaud President Trump for doing [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1668.24s)]
*  it. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1673.56s)]
*  Why don't we just declare our capital, the American capital, Moscow, and then we can [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1674.56s)]
*  just demand that every country in the world recognize Moscow as the American capital, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1677.84s)]
*  demand that they move all their embassies and ambassadors to the United States to Moscow [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1682.24s)]
*  and we'll just declare it our own. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1685.56s)]
*  Every country has a right to do that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1686.7s)]
*  Now one of the reasons the Democrats are so aligned with the Adelsons and with Donald [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1688.38s)]
*  Trump and being almost entirely as pro-Israel as the Adelsons want Trump to be is because [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1693.42s)]
*  they have their own billionaires spending similar amounts of money, very similar to [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1698.5s)]
*  the Adelsons with a very similar agenda, and they give their money very explicitly to the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1703.54s)]
*  Democratic Party in exchange for their loyalty to Israel as well. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1708.6200000000001s)]
*  Well from the New York Times in September of 2004, it was a profile on the mogul Haim [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1711.22s)]
*  Sabin, who is a billionaire who has funded much of the Democratic Party for decades, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1716.5s)]
*  and the title of the article that was a profile of him was Schlepping to Mogildom. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1722.98s)]
*  Quote, a self-described cartoon schlepper, Mr. Sabin became a billionaire by turning [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1727.22s)]
*  the mighty morphine Power Rangers into a global franchise that he merged with Rupert Murdoch's [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1731.9s)]
*  News Corporation and in 2001 sold to the Walt Disney Company for $5.3 billion. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1737.42s)]
*  He has since emerged as perhaps the most politically connected mogul in Hollywood, throwing his [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1742.78s)]
*  weight and money around Washington and increasingly the world trying to influence all things Israeli. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1747.1200000000001s)]
*  Quote, I'm a one issue guy, he said, and my issue is Israel. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1752.6200000000001s)]
*  Mr. Sabin's views on the matter are straightforward. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1758.14s)]
*  He is a tireless cheerleader for Israel, but when it comes to conflict there, his views [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1760.1000000000001s)]
*  are hardly sanguine. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1763.5s)]
*  Quote, I'm going to make a very controversial statement and I hope to God that I am proven [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1764.5s)]
*  totally wrong. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1769.34s)]
*  I think that any resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will have to go both on the Palestinian [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1770.34s)]
*  side and Israeli side to some form of civil war. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1775.18s)]
*  It's not going to be without spilling blood. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1778.34s)]
*  To that end, he has become one of the largest individual donors in the country to the Democratic [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1781.34s)]
*  Party and its candidates, giving millions over the past decade. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1785.38s)]
*  $7 million in just one donation to the DNC in 2002. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1788.7s)]
*  He recently had Senator John Kerry over to his chateau-style home in Beverly Hills. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1792.62s)]
*  Quote, we played guitar in Kibitz, he said. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1796.1399999999999s)]
*  He regularly spends hours at a time on the phone with Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1798.7399999999998s)]
*  Minister back in 2004. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1802.54s)]
*  He vacations with Bill Clinton. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1804.26s)]
*  So although I'm profiling and asking the question of who is Mary Madeleine and what does she [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1807.34s)]
*  want from the Republican Party and Donald Trump with the tens and hundreds of millions [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1812.5s)]
*  of dollars that she spends every election cycle, the Democrats have exactly the same [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1817.26s)]
*  incentives, exactly the sort of same financiers. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1820.66s)]
*  As their biggest donor for over the past couple of decades, Haim Sabin says, I'm the one issue [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1824.78s)]
*  guy and my issue is Israel. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1830.18s)]
*  So obviously that money comes with the same strings attached, which is the Democratic [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1831.98s)]
*  Party serve and be aligned with and loyal to the interests of Israel. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1835.0600000000002s)]
*  And that's why you see this bipartisan consensus on this question and looking at the people [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1839.7s)]
*  who cause this and who generate it and engender it and how they do that, I think is obviously [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1843.78s)]
*  something very important to do. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vCYS2w0Qg&t=1848.9799999999998s)]
