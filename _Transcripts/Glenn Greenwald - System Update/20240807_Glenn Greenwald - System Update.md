# Disgust at DNC "Leftists" Who Feigned Anger Over Gaza & Now DON'T CARE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ)
*  Here from the Jewish Community Relations Council and this is, I think, let's get the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=0.0s)]
*  data on this. It might be today. I'll check that. But yes, today this is the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  statement from the Jewish Community Relations Council in response to Kamala [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=18.96s)]
*  Harris's choice of Tim Waltz. The JCRC applauds Governor Tim Waltz's pro-Israel [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=23.34s)]
*  record stalwart friendship with the Jewish community. Walt has spoken [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=28.64s)]
*  forcefully in support of Israel and against anti-Semitism. Governor [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=33.2s)]
*  Waltz has spoken at three of the JCRC's past four annual events. Most recently at [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=38.44s)]
*  our annual event on June 2nd, 2024, Governor Waltz spoke up forcefully in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=44.32s)]
*  support of Israel and against those who seek to delegitimize it. He said, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=49.16s)]
*  I see people debating something that I don't feel is debatable here. The ability [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=53.56s)]
*  of Jewish people to self-determine themselves is foundational to everything. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=58.16s)]
*  And the failure to recognize the state of Israel's taking away that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  self-determination so it is anti-Semitic and that is a statement of fact. It's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=66.08s)]
*  anti-Semitic to be anti-Zionist. Governor Waltz also spoke about the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=70.32s)]
*  importance of quote, moral clarity of standing in solidarity with Israel [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=73.96s)]
*  against the terrorism of Amos both on June 2nd and October 10th, 2023. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=77.36s)]
*  Waltz said in the video quote, if you do not find moral clarity on Saturday morning [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=82.0s)]
*  and you find yourself wanting to think about what you needed to say, you need to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=86.8s)]
*  reevaluate where you're at. What was evident on the Saturday morning [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=90.28s)]
*  was the absolute lack of humanity, the terrorism, the barbarism. That's not a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=93.88s)]
*  geopolitical discussion, that's murder. Quote, we appreciate the strong stand [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=97.56s)]
*  that Governor Waltz has taken in defense of Jewish students who are grappling [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=101.4s)]
*  with unprecedented anti-Semitism. At our June event, the governor stated quote, we [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=104.4s)]
*  saw your children feeling like they couldn't be safe on college campuses in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  Minnesota and that is not only wrong, it breaks my heart. Now, or that is not only [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=112.88s)]
*  breaks my heart, but it is wrong. And here's a picture of Tim Waltz grinning [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=117.16s)]
*  happily standing at the side of Benjamin Netanyahu in 2009 and there's a lot of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=123.84s)]
*  other evidence as well about attempts to introduce into the Minnesota education [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=132.48s)]
*  curriculum quote, unquote education about the importance of Israel. There is not a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=136.8s)]
*  single word that Tim Walter Comble Harris has ever uttered to support this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=141.56s)]
*  lie from the DNC left that they're willing to vote for them and cheer for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=144.68s)]
*  them because they're somehow better on Israel. Here is the vocally pro-Israel [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=148.4s)]
*  congressman from New York, Richie Torres, the Democrat from New York. For some [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  reason he represents the single poorest district in all the United States and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=158.6s)]
*  yet has made his number one issue defense of some foreign country on the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=163.44s)]
*  other side of the world. He's obsessed with Israel, he hates the left for questioning Israel and US support for it. He's become probably [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=168.96s)]
*  wisely for his career I guess the leading defender in the Congress of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=176.04s)]
*  Israel and I guess the fact that he's black and Dominican and gay makes him [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=181.84s)]
*  very very very valuable to that cause. He has a very good political future I [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=186.08s)]
*  predict for Richie Torres and I almost never agree with him. In fact he blocked [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=190.36s)]
*  me on Twitter because of criticism I made of him but he said something today [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=195.52s)]
*  that I thought was at least in part correct. He actually said this yesterday [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  right before the announcement of the vice president was suggest. He said this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=203.28s)]
*  quote, the anti-Israel activists who've been falsely accusing the Biden Harris [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  administration of funding quote genocide are suddenly fine with Vice President [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=213.36s)]
*  Harris as long as she declines to choose Governor Shapiro as a running mate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=218.0s)]
*  Never mind that the pro-Israel views of Governor Shapiro are indistinguishable [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=222.72s)]
*  from those of Vice President Harris. Sorry but he has that pro DNC left dead [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=227.8s)]
*  to rights there. He is absolutely a hundred percent accurate that Kamala [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=234.2s)]
*  Harris is every bit as pro-Israel as President Biden and every bit as [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=241.4s)]
*  pro-Israel as Josh Shapiro and that the views the pro-Israel views of Governor [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=246.56s)]
*  Shapiro are indistinguishable from those of Vice President Harris that is [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=252.28s)]
*  absolutely completely true. And he then goes on to say these hypocrites are full [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=255.28s)]
*  of shit and their anti-semitic dog-whistling should be given no veto [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=260.08s)]
*  power over the selection of a presidential running mate. Now I spent [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=263.84s)]
*  the first segment explaining why I don't think that last part is true. I don't [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=267.4s)]
*  think this proves anti-semitism. Opposing a Jewish politician is not proof of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=270.16s)]
*  anti-semitism. There are a lot of reasons why the left rationally and without [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=274.08s)]
*  bigotry would prefer Tim Waltz over Josh Shapiro but it's absolutely the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=278.04s)]
*  case that if you claim that you're so morally offended by genocide that you [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=283.16s)]
*  could not be cheering for this ticket given how pro-Israel they've been. Now [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=290.72s)]
*  we've talked before about how often Kamala Harris herself has expressed [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=295.16s)]
*  vehement support for US support for Israel. Here she is in January of this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  year when she went on The View and here's what she said. Many say that one [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=307.56s)]
*  of your many strengths as a surrogate is your connection to young people. I [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=312.24s)]
*  believe that to be true. Now voters between 18 and 29 years old stand out [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=316.08s)]
*  as disapproving of the way the Biden administration is handling the Israel [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=321.24s)]
*  Hamas war. They do not support sending weapons and money to Israel. They are [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=326.04s)]
*  advocating for a humanitarian ceasefire. How does the administration respond to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=331.26s)]
*  the concerns of this very important part of the Democratic voter base? So [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=337.2s)]
*  let's start with this and you're right Sunny in fact in the fall I embarked on [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=344.2s)]
*  what I called a college tour and met with over 15,000 students across the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  country. I just have to say I love Gen Z by the way. I think it's a spectacular [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=357.84s)]
*  generation. So just for the record she loves Gen Z. They're a spectacular [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=363.6s)]
*  generation. She really loves them. She loves the young people with all our [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  heart and then she goes on to say this. But all of that to say you're absolutely [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=375.64000000000004s)]
*  right. I have talked with young people many around the country and I've heard [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=379.16s)]
*  them. I see them and I understand. I understand but I think it's important [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  that while we understand where they're coming from, which I do, that we not lose [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=391.0s)]
*  sight of the context which is let's just go back to October 7th. We can't deny the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=397.84s)]
*  significance of a vicious brutal attack that caused the death of 1,200 innocent [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=407.67999999999995s)]
*  people, a lot of them young people who are just attending a concert. Women who [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=415.08s)]
*  were brutally assaulted and raped and again as someone who spent a lot of my [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  career focused on those kinds of crimes, the horror of it and all of that to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  also then. By the way there have been a lot of reports over the last two weeks. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  Definitive confirmed reports that Palestinian prisoners in detention in [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=438.12s)]
*  Israel, administrative detention meaning no trial, no due process, have been [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=444.68s)]
*  sexually assaulted, raped, rectally abused, sent to the hospital. Kamala Harris [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=448.9s)]
*  who's so so devoted in her career to the evil and immorality of sexual assault [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=455.34s)]
*  hasn't uttered a peep of concern or protest about Israeli sexual assault of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=461.73999999999995s)]
*  detainees even though she's going back many months or three months at this [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  point to justify US support for the war in Israel. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=472.41999999999996s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself. We would and how it does matters. There have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  been far too many innocent Palestinians that have been killed. The president and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=486.09999999999997s)]
*  I and many members of our administration have been very clear. I've been over on [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=490.7s)]
*  over I think 14-15 calls that the president has had with Bibi Netanyahu [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  about what Israel must do to protect innocent civilians. We all want this to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=500.06s)]
*  end as soon as possible and how it ends matters. Which includes that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=508.3s)]
*  Israel must be secure, that there must be an equal measure of security for the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=515.74s)]
*  Palestinians who are entitled to dignity and self-determination. The hostages must [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=521.7s)]
*  be freed and it's since the first day I have been very focused in addition to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=528.42s)]
*  all we just discussed on the day after. I do believe we must be committed to an [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=534.78s)]
*  eventual two-state solution and we have articulated what that looks like and I [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=542.38s)]
*  have met with not only Israeli leaders but Arab leaders about what that can [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=549.3s)]
*  look like if we have a commitment to the day after. So all of these things are [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=555.46s)]
*  true. I mean that's just standard Democratic Party caches. Oh she's for a [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=560.98s)]
*  two-state solution which is completely impossible as a result of Israeli [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=567.26s)]
*  expansion of settlement in the West Bank which can never be removed. That's a [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=571.86s)]
*  complete pipe dream of a solution that's never gonna happen. But she did not [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=575.14s)]
*  indicate in the slightest way that yeah we should roll back our funding of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=579.82s)]
*  Israel or do you think that anything she said there indicates in any way that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=585.82s)]
*  she would do that? That's the standard Democratic Party script. Those words [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=590.22s)]
*  could have come out of Joe Biden's mouth and have come out of Joe Biden's mouth [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=593.74s)]
*  many many times. I can show you a lot more of those videos including where she spoke [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=596.5400000000001s)]
*  at APAC but you get the point. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30rGGOC7RQ&t=600.9000000000001s)]
