# The EU's Major Reality Check
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A)
*  One of the most bizarre things to watch over the last several years ever since the Russian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=0.0s)]
*  invasion in February of 2022 in Ukraine is watching Europeans and European officials [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=12.24s)]
*  in Brussels, bureaucrats and bureaucrats start acting like they're refighting World War [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=18.06s)]
*  II or fighting World War III against the Russia. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=25.76s)]
*  They all have to walk around. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=27.72s)]
*  They're going to defeat Russia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=28.72s)]
*  You have German leaders talking about sending tanks for the third time in the last hundred [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=29.72s)]
*  years eastward toward Russia, which they ultimately did. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=36.16s)]
*  You have German leaders in outdoor rallies saying, we must defeat Russia. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=41.6s)]
*  We must take them down. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=44.96s)]
*  And you have all these tiny little countries and their tiny little prime ministers talking [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=48.8s)]
*  with a million people in the entire country acting like they're Winston Churchill. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=54.08s)]
*  And ever since the pronouncements by Donald Trump about his intentions to say, we're not [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=60.96s)]
*  going to keep paying for your defense, Europe. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=70.64s)]
*  Why would we pay for your defense? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=73.6s)]
*  You offer this very ample welfare state to your people and they love it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=75.2s)]
*  That's understandable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  You're not impoverished. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=80.76s)]
*  You're perfectly capable of doing it yourself. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=81.76s)]
*  Ever since they've gone completely insane acting like, okay, now we're going to become [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=83.64s)]
*  these military superpower. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=89.12s)]
*  We were always meant to be without the United States. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=90.56s)]
*  The problem is Europe is a joke militarily. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=94.28s)]
*  They're an absolute joke. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  France and the UK have a small nuclear arsenal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  So that makes them serious on that level. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  But in terms of conventionalism, they're not going to be able to do that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  They're going to be able to do it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  That makes them serious on that level. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  But in terms of conventional military fighting, they're laughable. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=109.96s)]
*  In fact, in that signal chat group that we just went over, Mike Waltz, because JD Vance [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  was saying, why are we fighting this fight for Europe again? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=121.92s)]
*  Aren't we sending the signal that we're not going to fight their fights? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=125.48s)]
*  We're not going to pay for their fights? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=128.76s)]
*  40%. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=130.64s)]
*  They're the ones who need the Suez Canal, not Americans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=131.64s)]
*  We barely use it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=134.32s)]
*  And Mike Waltz, who is eager to do the bombing as is Pete Hegseth, said this, quote, whether [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=136.24s)]
*  we pull the plug or not today, European navies do not have the capability to defend against [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=141.48s)]
*  the types of sophisticated anti-ship cruise missiles and drones the Houthis are now using. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  So whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=155.32s)]
*  that reopens these shipping lanes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  Per the president's request, we are working with DOD and state to determine how to compile [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=159.96s)]
*  the costs associated and levy them on the Europeans. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=164.32s)]
*  So according to Mike Waltz, the National Security Advisor, Europe doesn't even have the military [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=166.64s)]
*  capability to fight the Houthis. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  Their navy is insufficient. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=176.0s)]
*  The Houthis have more sophisticated weaponry and more fighting capability than the Europeans, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=177.72s)]
*  who nonetheless have been walking around beating their chest. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=184.16s)]
*  We're Europe. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=186.64s)]
*  We're going to build our own military. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=187.64s)]
*  We're going to fight Russia. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  We're going to defeat them, consign them to the asheap of history. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  We don't need the United States. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=193.04s)]
*  All of that rhetoric is about three weeks old. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=195.92s)]
*  And already Europe is confronting the reality that they're Europe and that none of that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=199.28s)]
*  tough talk is possible. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=204.88s)]
*  Even the New York Times is mocking them now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=208.12s)]
*  Here's the New York Times from today. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=209.6s)]
*  Europe talks top on military spending, but unity is fracturing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=210.88s)]
*  Quote, European leaders are struggling to find the money and the political will to replace [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=215.48s)]
*  the bulk of the U.S. contribution to Ukraine and to their own defense. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=220.6s)]
*  The article begins, quote, the Dutch and others are not fans of raising collective debt for [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=226.64s)]
*  defense. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=231.0s)]
*  Keeping Hungary on board is even more difficult. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=232.0s)]
*  And when the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced a plan for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=234.84s)]
*  billions more for the military called Rearm Europe, two of the bloc's largest countries, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=239.64s)]
*  Italy and Spain, thought that that was all a bit aggressive. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=245.92s)]
*  So now the plan has been rebranded as Readiness 2030. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  Kaja Kallis, the former prime minister of Estonia, which has a population of about 1.1 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=254.96s)]
*  million people, fewer than the number of people who live in Paris, she resigned in disgrace [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=261.08s)]
*  from the prime ministership because her husband got caught doing millions of dollars in business [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=266.66s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=271.16s)]
*  At a time she was saying Russia is the root of all evil and we have to sanction them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=272.16s)]
*  But she had a very safe landing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=276.12s)]
*  She is now the chief foreign and security official for the European Union. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=278.08s)]
*  She has been a forceful advocate, I would call deranged, for supporting Ukraine as a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=281.44s)]
*  first line of European defense against an aggressive militarized Russia. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=285.76s)]
*  But it has been a rocky start for Ms. Kallis. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=290.64s)]
*  Her effort to get the EU to provide up to 40 billion euros, more than 43 billion dollars, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=294.0s)]
*  to Ukraine through a small fixed percentage levy on each country's national income has [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=300.32s)]
*  gone nowhere. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=304.8s)]
*  Her backup proposal, just for an added $5 billion as a first step to providing Ukraine [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  2 million artillery shells this year, was also rejected by Italy, Slovakia, and even [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=311.76s)]
*  France, an EU official said. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=317.12s)]
*  Speaking anonymously in accordance with diplomatic practice, the countries insisted that contributions [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=319.72s)]
*  to Ukraine remain voluntary, bilateral, and not requested by Brussels. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  And her recent response to Mr. Trump's effort to push Ukraine into a ceasefire without security [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=330.6s)]
*  assurances rubbed many the wrong way, both in Europe and Washington as dangerously premature. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=335.08s)]
*  Quote, the free world needs a new leader, she wrote on X. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=340.96s)]
*  It's up to us, Europeans, to take on this challenge. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=345.08s)]
*  But in fact, the Europeans are working hard to respond to Mr. Trump in a convincing fashion. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=349.8s)]
*  Ms. Vandervlaan sold her rearmament of readiness plan with a headline figure of 800 billion [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=353.88s)]
*  euros. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=359.92s)]
*  But only 150 billion euros of that is real money available as long-term loans for countries [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=361.94s)]
*  that wish to use it for their military. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  The rest simply represents a notional figure, a four-year permission from the bloc for countries [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=369.34s)]
*  to borrow even more for military purposes out of their own national budgets. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=375.14s)]
*  Most of these European countries are struggling greatly with their economy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=382.54s)]
*  Their populations hate them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=387.02s)]
*  There's massive anti-establishment sentiment throughout all of Western Europe and even [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=389.82s)]
*  in Central Europe. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=393.88s)]
*  It's the reason why people in the UK voted to leave Brexit, to leave the EU with Brexit [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=395.32s)]
*  because they didn't want to be governed by these kinds of people in Brussels. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=401.86s)]
*  It's the reason why right-wing populist parties that countries never thought would succeed [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=406.1s)]
*  in France, in the Netherlands, in Italy, and many more places are gaining in popularity [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=412.6s)]
*  because they're channeling this anti-establishment sentiment. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=420.8s)]
*  And none of these Europeans want to give up the massive state benefits that they get, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  which is a crucial part of being European. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  A month vacation and tons of time off, or paternity and maternity leave, retiring early, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  not working a 40-hour work week. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=441.4s)]
*  These are all things essential to the Europeans. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=442.96s)]
*  They're not going to give that up to build a massive military, go into massive debt for [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=444.52s)]
*  it, especially when a lot of these countries like France are already in enormous amounts [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=450.24s)]
*  of debt. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  And yet here is Ursula von der Leyen, a warmonger and a German who nobody elected to become [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  the president of the EU other than the members of the EU parliament. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  Here she is on March 4th talking so tough about her rearmament plan. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=469.8s)]
*  We're living in the most momentous and dangerous of times. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=475.0s)]
*  I do not need to describe the grave nature of the threats that we face or the devastating [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=479.6s)]
*  consequences that we will have to endure if those threats would come to pass, because [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  the question is no longer whether Europe's security is threatened in a very real way, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=494.52s)]
*  or whether Europe should shoulder more of its responsibility for its own security. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=501.36s)]
*  In truth, we have long known the answers to those questions. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=507.96s)]
*  The real question in front of us is whether Europe is prepared to act as decisively as [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=513.42s)]
*  the situation dictates. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=520.24s)]
*  We are in an era of rearmament. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=523.36s)]
*  And Europe is ready to massively boost its defense spending, both to respond to the short-term [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  urgency to act and to support Ukraine, but also to address the long-term need to take [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=534.32s)]
*  on more responsibility for our own European security. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=541.48s)]
*  One of the ironies, by the way, she said Europe is ready to rearm and build her own defense. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=548.22s)]
*  Evidently they're not. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=552.96s)]
*  One of the ironies of all of this is that the most strident warmongers in Europe are [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  women politicians who are on the center-left, the center of European politics. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=562.2800000000001s)]
*  And the reason I say it's ironic is because the most belligerent, aggressive, and warmongering [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=567.96s)]
*  party in all of Europe, when it comes to Ukraine and Russia, when it comes to Israel, when [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=573.1s)]
*  it comes to a variety of other potential wars, is the German Green Party, whose figurehead [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=576.96s)]
*  is Annalena Bobrik, who is the foreign minister of Germany. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=582.72s)]
*  And the German Greens ran on a platform that elevated her and the Greens to the parliament. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=589.76s)]
*  They ran on a platform what they called a feminist foreign policy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  They said our party is dominated by women. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=599.44s)]
*  We're going to have female officials in the most important offices. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=602.08s)]
*  And because women are more inclined to resolve disputes through diplomacy and conciliation [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=608.88s)]
*  and not with war and aggression, a feminist foreign policy is one that's less antagonistic, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=613.72s)]
*  less belligerent. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=619.48s)]
*  That's the campaign they ran on. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=620.48s)]
*  Now I personally find this kind of essentializing, men are more aggressive and inclined to war, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=622.52s)]
*  women are more, whatever, conciliatory, to be extremely reductive. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  And obviously you can use that same reasoning not to elevate women but to demean them. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=632.36s)]
*  Women are more emotional, men are more rational, women don't belong in position of the power, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=639.36s)]
*  etc. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=642.84s)]
*  That's the same exact kind of thinking. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=643.84s)]
*  But for whatever reason, the most unhinged voices who practically think they're at war [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=646.84s)]
*  with Russia and are ready to build up this military are women politicians in Europe on [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=652.6s)]
*  the center and center left. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  And one of them, Kaja Kalas, who I just mentioned, the former prime minister of the crucial state [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=659.8s)]
*  of Estonia, all one million people who live there, has become so deranged that she's even [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=666.0s)]
*  starting to genuinely disturb a lot of European officials, including many who are for the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  war in Ukraine but are very alarmed by the way she's speaking. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=679.56s)]

*  Kaja Kalas is, quote, acting like a prime minister, critics of EU's top diplomat say. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=686.72s)]
*  Kaja Kalas' troubles started on her first day. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=693.28s)]
*  The EU's top diplomat was on a trip to Kiev when she tweeted, quote, the European Union [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=696.76s)]
*  wants Ukraine to win this war against Russia. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=700.96s)]
*  Some EU officials said they felt uneasy that the head of the European External Action Service, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=704.8s)]
*  less than a day into her job, felt that liberty to go beyond what they considered to be settled [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=709.68s)]
*  language more than two years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=714.88s)]
*  The aforementioned diplomat and nine other EU diplomats and officials pointed to what [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=718.12s)]
*  they viewed as a series of missteps during Kalas' first few months on the job, from floating [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=723.92s)]
*  heavy proposals without buy-in to taking liberties with foreign policy statements, they told [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=729.34s)]
*  Politico. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=734.52s)]
*  She still has her defenders, one of whom is the Danish prime minister, Medi Ferdiksen, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=736.84s)]
*  and another female politician who's extremely pro-war and backs Kaja Kalas. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=742.56s)]
*  A second diplomat anonymously said, quote, overall we are very happy with her. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=749.4s)]
*  It goes on as Kalas put her stamp on the job pressuring EU countries to give more military [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=758.4s)]
*  aid to Ukraine. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=763.7199999999999s)]
*  Several diplomats chafed at her leadership style, complaining of what they described [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=765.28s)]
*  as a lack of consultation, unsensitive matters, and subsequent months those concerns have [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  only grown, including regarding Kalas' hawkishness on Russia, which has left her out of step [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=773.92s)]
*  with Spain and Italy, who do not share her assessment of Moscow as an imminent threat [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=780.28s)]
*  to the EU. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=784.92s)]
*  Quote, if you listen to her, it seems we are at war with Russia, which is not the EU line [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=785.92s)]
*  one EU official complained. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=791.1999999999999s)]

*  there. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=832.32s)]
*  Just to give you the kind of rhetoric this person uses, this Kajik Halas person, here [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=834.36s)]
*  she is at the EU Council addressing the fact that there are EU members like Hungary that [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=840.24s)]
*  don't support this foreign policy, that don't want to confront Russia, that want to try [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=849.7800000000001s)]
*  and put an end diplomatically to the war in Ukraine. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  And here's the kind of language she used against them. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  Every day Russia continues its war, the price must go up. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  Now we are working on another, a 16th package of sanctions. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=864.8000000000001s)]
*  We have started to see Russia's economy taking a serious hit. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=868.72s)]
*  They could not afford to continue their efforts in Syria while fighting in Ukraine. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=873.16s)]
*  Russia's national funds are quickly depleting. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=879.12s)]
*  The national interest rate is well over 20%. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  And they are getting far fewer resources from gas and oil. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=887.1s)]
*  Gazprom and Sberbank are looking at mass layoffs. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=891.9s)]
*  There is absolutely no doubt that we can do more to help Ukraine. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=897.62s)]
*  With our help, they can also win the war. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=902.28s)]
*  The only language that Putin speaks is the language of strength. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=905.78s)]
*  The EU has strength. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=909.6999999999999s)]
*  Believing that Ukraine can win the war, meaning expelling all Russian troops from every inch [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=912.58s)]
*  of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, requires madness at this point. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=917.5s)]
*  But what does she care? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=922.34s)]
*  She's from a tiny little country that will contribute nothing. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=924.58s)]
*  She's demanding that workers in Italy, in Spain, in France, and Germany pay for the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=928.7s)]
*  glories of this war that she wants. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=936.0600000000001s)]

*  I understand the history of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=940.22s)]
*  She has to face reality. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=945.86s)]
*  And she wants to be this glamorous, strong, Churchillian war leader. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=947.98s)]
*  But the EU doesn't have anywhere near the capability to back up those words. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=952.0600000000001s)]
*  Here is Kajakalos in May of last year at a different conference. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=958.22s)]
*  Russia's defeat is not a bad thing because then there could be really a change in the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=967.34s)]
*  society. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=976.1s)]
*  And there are many different nations right now, apart from Russia as well. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=977.1s)]
*  I think if you would have more small nations, it's not a bad thing if the big power is actually [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=981.38s)]
*  much smaller. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=989.34s)]
*  She's talking about regime change in Russia, changing the government of Russia, and then [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=993.26s)]
*  breaking Russia up into a bunch of little different pieces. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=996.5s)]
*  That's the foreign minister of the EU engaged in utterly deranged, fairytale thinking. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1002.58s)]
*  Here is the prime minister of Finland, Mette Fredriksen. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1010.58s)]

*  She's Danish. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1023.78s)]
*  Yes, she's the Danish prime minister. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1024.78s)]
*  And here's how she's speaking. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1026.42s)]
*  I don't think we should panic, but I think we are in a hurry. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1029.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think we have been in a hurry for three years, but now we really have to scale up [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1034.3s)]
*  and to speed up because Russia and Putin is not only threatening Ukraine, but all of us. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1039.7s)]
*  And we have to be able to defend ourselves. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1046.5s)]
*  My idea about Ukraine is the same as it has been now for three years, that they have to [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1048.62s)]
*  win this war. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1053.5s)]
*  And if we allow Russia to win the war, I'm sorry to say it directly to all of you, he [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1054.5s)]
*  will continue and they will continue. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  And maybe we will even give them a better situation than today because if we end this [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1063.1399999999999s)]
*  war now, some kind of a frozen conflict, a ceasefire, it will give Russia the possibility [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1068.3s)]
*  to return to Russia, to mobilize more funds, people, and maybe to attack another country [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1074.9s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1080.46s)]
*  The reason these people live in a fantasy world is because they've had the United States [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1082.0600000000002s)]
*  financing and arming and fighting their wars for them for so many decades. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1088.98s)]
*  So they've gotten to simultaneously talk tough as though they're fighting wars because they [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1094.42s)]
*  contribute some troops, while at the same time not having to spend any of their people's [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1099.42s)]
*  money on it and giving them a welfare state that you can afford to give if you're not [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1105.94s)]
*  spending massive amounts in the military the way the United States has been doing. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtXnRwT8K9A&t=1110.8200000000002s)]
