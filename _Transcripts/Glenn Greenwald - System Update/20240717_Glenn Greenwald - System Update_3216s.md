# Michael Tracey, Matt Taibbi, Walter Kirn on the RNC, Trump, and More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw)
*  Okay, so here we are world people men women everybody in between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=0.0s)]
*  Wisconsin Milwaukee Matt Tybee Walter Kern [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=5.48s)]
*  So guys, what's up, Michael? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=9.28s)]
*  Keep your hands off last time I saw Michael he was chugging across the American continent in his car [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=13.92s)]
*  in an underpowered compact car I [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=19.76s)]
*  I [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=23.52s)]
*  Trucked here in the same underpowered compact car. It's still working [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=24.8s)]
*  Well, do you believe it's not broke don't fix it right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  That was after the George Floyd riot. Yeah, that was those are of love. I was a pro was almost exactly four years ago [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=32.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it was July of 2020 that we were in Montana. Just almost exactly four years. Yeah exactly here [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=38.74s)]
*  We are and you know divine providence. Yeah, so that leads to my first question [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  I just spoke to Congressman Mike Collins not to be confused with [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=48.88s)]
*  Congressman Doug Collins both of Georgia [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=52.96s)]
*  No relation he informed me but Mike Collins is he repeated something that you've heard from a lot of people [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=55.88s)]
*  Which is that they felt that there was divine intervention. Oh god, that's Dave Trump from the bullet now. I [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=62.36s)]
*  Guess I'm not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=70.2s)]
*  metaphysically inclined or [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=72.64s)]
*  Providentially inclined or whatever, but I can't say I have the ultimate explanations about the nature of the universe [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=74.36s)]
*  So I'm not gonna go out of my way to disprove that assertion because who the hell knows but I [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=80.64s)]
*  Just wonder how much is this enhancing or bolstering the mythology around Trump such that people aren't gonna care at all about the policy [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=85.76s)]
*  Substance of what he does or his record. It seems like it this is turbocharged like the folklore [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=93.56s)]
*  Around Trump, but I'm just wondering if you guys will pick up on any of that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  This is the Joseph Campbell convention, you know, this is a Star Wars [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=103.68s)]
*  Origin story or something that's happening here in which you know, the father is is grazed by a bullet [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=109.52s)]
*  I already saw a Japanese anime short [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=115.96s)]
*  With Trump as a kind of square-jawed giant person, you know [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=120.56s)]
*  And he catches the bullet next to his ear quick turn around. Yeah [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=124.52s)]
*  So in the anime world, it wasn't divine intervention. It was kind of incredible prowess [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=129.6s)]
*  To duck that bullet but you know in the world of the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=135.64s)]
*  evangelical southern [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=141.04s)]
*  Republican, I can't imagine a better proof of their worldview [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=143.04s)]
*  You know [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  We all we all got to take turns letting people have their wins and and the divine intervention team [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=148.55999999999997s)]
*  I think should be given a lot of latitude to interpret this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  We've already seen online, you know, there's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  Somebody was talking about how Trump in the moment that he fell was radically saved [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=163.44s)]
*  Yes, and so he [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=169.64s)]
*  He was on his knees and was right in that moment [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=172.2s)]
*  But Matt that was an actual prophecy that was a video of a Christmas self-described [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=175.88s)]
*  Christian prophet that was made three months ago and it got wide circulation right after the assassination [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=181.62s)]
*  That was a guy predicting that something would happen [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=187.32s)]
*  It was even more to the favor of the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=190.86s)]
*  Christian metaphysicians [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=195.3s)]
*  and and so but that photo of him between the legs of the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=197.74s)]
*  Secret Service people with his head to the ground [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=203.02s)]
*  So on the flip side of that though we were just talking about this on our own show that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=207.18s)]
*  You know the decision to bring Amber Rose out last night [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  Definitely raised some eyebrows with the kind of family values crowd of Matt Walsh [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=215.5s)]
*  Had some pretty negative things to say about that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=221.06s)]
*  so [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=224.22000000000003s)]
*  Yes, you know Trump is obviously a complicated figure for the evangelical [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=225.34s)]
*  voter [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  but [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=232.34s)]
*  You know, I don't know. I think maybe even [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  You know the decisions to try to widen the tent a little bit [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  It might mute a little bit of that mythos. So though after the assassination [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  I think I think he's parlaying the mythos, you know, there's there's the saying that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=246.7s)]
*  You know you lose political capital unless you use it and I think that's true of mythological capital, too [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  So I think after the divine intervention Trump could afford to bring a little goddess worship into the can [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=257.12s)]
*  into the convention hall which [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=263.26s)]
*  The figure of Amber Rose was appropriate for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=265.94s)]
*  According to this prophecy Trump had been fallen meaning he had not been saved until just this past Saturday [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=269.5s)]
*  Because yes, because according to can more conventional [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=275.62s)]
*  conventional [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=279.06s)]
*  Evangelical perspectives on Trump as far as I've been aware. Yeah, is that he was already chosen as this imperfect vessel to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=280.18s)]
*  effectuate God's will [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=287.98s)]
*  long before July of 2024, right so they already kind of saw him as having this redemptive arc [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=289.86s)]
*  that he was using to do the will of God in office or [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=297.46s)]
*  You know curtail abortion that sort of things like what what flaws did he have to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=301.66s)]
*  Remediate as of last Saturday, which is what was hastened by the bullet [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=307.38000000000005s)]
*  Over literal unfair to the Old Testament crowd here [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=315.06s)]
*  Okay, because the original imperfect vessel if you'll remember was Moses the guy who said why me man? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=318.18s)]
*  I can't even talk to a crowd, you know, and so [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=324.3s)]
*  The notion that that Trump is [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=329.14s)]
*  Kind of growing and being challenged and the many miracles of Trump are still happening [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=332.3s)]
*  Is I think an interfaith? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  sort of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=341.46s)]
*  Idea and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  He but to put to the crowd of Christians who I think have just been through the Stormy Daniels trial [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  He probably has a ways to go in his purification [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=353.3s)]
*  Sure about that, I mean do you think that evangelicals were really wavering on Trump because of the story summary Daniels trial [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=358.18s)]
*  I got the impression that Trump views [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=365.82s)]
*  Evangelicals or Christian conservatives so rock-solid that he doesn't even have to really cater to them anymore [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=369.14s)]
*  Like for example, just saying I'll leave it to the states for abortion [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  We're not gonna do any federal prohibitions on abortion. He said at the debate with Biden [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  Everybody was obviously fixated on Joe's implosion [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=381.02s)]
*  but Trump also said that he had no problem with the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=383.62s)]
*  Male abortion pill going out. So it seems like if this was 2016 Trump will be much more [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=387.82s)]
*  Aciduous in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=396.46s)]
*  Demonstrating to the Christian conservatives that they could count on him to do their agenda [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=398.5s)]
*  Even if he had a Manhattan liberal casino magnate background [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=402.94s)]
*  Whereas 2024 Trump has nothing to prove with them anymore [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=406.58s)]
*  So we can kind of stray a little bit off the reservation and yet still be [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=410.36s)]
*  Almost guarantee that the Christian conservatives are gonna vote Trump because in part of them this mythological connection that they have with them [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=414.84s)]
*  Yeah, again, we were just talking about this too, but but [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  in 2016, you know, I remember going out [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=425.28s)]
*  When he had that sort of redemption tour for African American voters. Yeah [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=429.64s)]
*  2016 yeah, I went to like black churches [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=436.52s)]
*  It was weirder than that he went he went to like all white suburbs and places like the Iowa County Fair [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=439.52s)]
*  but gave speeches about how he was he was the best friend of the African American voter and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=446.2s)]
*  This was a calculation by Steve Bannon who was running his campaign at the time that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump was behind but that was only because [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=457.64s)]
*  Republicans [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=461.28s)]
*  weren't accepting of him that he he needed to read [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=462.76s)]
*  some Republicans felt he was too [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  You know far from their model to and maybe too too much of a racist to vote for and so they figured that if they did [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=468.56s)]
*  This little show that they would recapture [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=476.88s)]
*  Some Republicans would feel that they had permission to vote for him again [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=479.4s)]
*  and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=484.12s)]
*  But the calculus this time around is totally different [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  They're not trying just to get because he was yeah [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it was something like only 60% of Republicans were solid Trump voters heading into November [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=490.5s)]
*  He had an enormous number of people who were kind of felt negatively about both candidates this time around he doesn't have that problem [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=497.4s)]
*  You're right. And so he's they're aiming in other directions, which is really interesting. Yeah, I guess a [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  Part of why I'm a little bit [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=512.4s)]
*  Skeptical that the choice of Vance [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  Was the most politically or electorally? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=518.16s)]
*  Adventitious pick he could have made now, maybe he picked Vance for reasons beyond [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=521.64s)]
*  Campaign success that could be the case. Maybe they're confident in his chances to win which is probably justified [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=526.64s)]
*  But I maybe I was a bit of a Doug Burgum dead-ender because I thought maybe him or somebody akin to him like a Glenn [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  Yonkin or something that would appeal to a [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=540.76s)]
*  more of a [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=544.68s)]
*  center, right [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=546.16s)]
*  centrist [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=547.76s)]
*  affluent suburban type voter who might have [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=548.8399999999999s)]
*  Reservations about Trump personally, maybe view him as a bit of a chaos agent still [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=552.0s)]
*  They swung against him in 2020 [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=556.24s)]
*  In the major states and I felt like there might have been a pick he might have made [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=558.72s)]
*  to appeal or ameliorate that demographic, but he seems to have calculated that that wasn't necessary and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=563.52s)]
*  Has gone with someone who I'm not sure what added benefit Vance gives him in terms of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  Electoral appeal maybe it intensifies [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  Certain of the ideological appeal among a segment of Republicans, but in terms of expanding beyond Trump's typical range of supporters [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=579.4s)]
*  Maybe I might slightly agree with the conventional pundit wisdom that I'm not sure that Vance really assists in that regard [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=587.96s)]
*  So I totally disagree, but I'm sure you have thoughts on this. Do you want to well you go first? Yeah, so [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=595.12s)]
*  We we talked a lot yesterday about [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=601.52s)]
*  There was apparently a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=604.92s)]
*  Pretty intense behind-the-scenes fight even into yesterday over who was going to be the VP pick and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=606.92s)]
*  the choice really came down to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=614.88s)]
*  Sort of heavy lobbying by Lindsey Graham [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=618.0s)]
*  You know other traditional Republicans so that to have marker Rubio be the choice and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=622.6s)]
*  That would have represented kind of the traditional [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  Kind of center-right Republican national security state, I think that would have been nearly fatal to his candidacy because [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=631.76s)]
*  The entire populist idea would would be in trouble at that point and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=640.6s)]
*  They would think about what that would say about Ukraine for instance, right? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=646.24s)]
*  You know that kind of a choice [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=650.52s)]
*  By choosing Vance. Yeah, it's kind of a double-down on this idea that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=652.48s)]
*  Of a more populist kind of nationalist [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  Concept it's it's the most anti-war choice that he could have made I think [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=661.4000000000001s)]
*  and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=667.08s)]
*  So that I don't know who else he would have chosen that could have could have expanded [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=668.2800000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's maybe it didn't expand his base [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=673.4000000000001s)]
*  But it solidified his image in a way that you know somebody like Rubio would have put it in peril [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=675.74s)]
*  Would anybody have not voted for Trump because he picked Rubio I [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=682.52s)]
*  Know people who are yes supporters who said they would I think they claim that as like a threat [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=686.64s)]
*  But when the rubber hits the road and it's late October, what are they gonna do? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=691.16s)]
*  You know [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=695.48s)]
*  Yeah, but you can say that about Vance to when the rubber hits the road are the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=696.88s)]
*  slight differences that you're talking about or [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=701.28s)]
*  Gonna matter they're voting for Donald Trump, you know and and time and time again [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  They've done analyses of the effect of the vice presidential [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=708.56s)]
*  Side of the ticket on people's voting habits, and it's negligible in every case almost [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=712.44s)]
*  What the news today for Trump that it wasn't electoral but financial was that Andreessen Horowitz the the giant and sort of top-line [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=719.44s)]
*  California venture capital firm of Mark Andreessen and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  Ben Horowitz came out and said they're going to be donating to the Trump campaign or to [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=733.84s)]
*  Political action committees that support it in a substantial way that was I think undercover news today because it was [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=740.2s)]
*  Basically a signal an all-clear signal to Silicon Valley that it's okay to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=747.92s)]
*  Back Donald Trump and in fact the way Silicon Valley works where everybody's looking for an investment from a place like Andreessen Horowitz [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=754.28s)]
*  You're gonna see a lot of you know [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=760.76s)]
*  overnight conversions to the Trump things from people who are gonna be pitching [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=763.8s)]
*  Them on their startup next month so [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=769.1600000000001s)]
*  And Vance I think was the key in solidifying that new [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=772.96s)]
*  VC [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=778.88s)]
*  West Coast tech [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=780.32s)]
*  Coalition [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=783.2800000000001s)]
*  So it's not necessarily an electoral advantage, but he comes from that world. He's known in that world. He's popular there and [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=784.7600000000001s)]
*  I think he's brought that side [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=792.36s)]
*  Over they might have they might have come over anyway, but they've done so with alacrity [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=795.44s)]
*  Sorry one more thing quickly, you know Glenn obviously published the Darrell Cooper essay [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=800.88s)]
*  It was a sort of a big Twitter thread that was expanded into the essay and [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=807.72s)]
*  It was explaining why Trump has such wide appeal [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=813.52s)]
*  And this is why the VP pick was important because for a lot of Trump supporters [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=817.72s)]
*  It's like a life or death issue with the deep state and all that like if they believe that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  They're so deep into this idea that [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=829.2s)]
*  There's this all-consuming repressive [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=832.48s)]
*  National security state and that Trump [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=835.44s)]
*  Represents some kind of opposition to it, which I think is bogus, but I know that they believe this [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=838.64s)]
*  I don't know that it's completely bogus [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  But but it would have it would have been more transparently bogus if he had picked if he had Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=844.84s)]
*  In tow for the entire campaign. He's got Mike Pompeo speaking in primetime at this convention. He's got Nikki Haley here [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=851.96s)]
*  He's got every hawk under the Sun claiming that they're America first or MAGA now including Lindsey Graham [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=858.16s)]
*  I mean why is it that Lindsey Graham has their opposite as a president so you can afford to make the beautiful gestures [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=863.12s)]
*  But Lindsey Graham has Lindsey Graham is able to lobby Trump because he has such close access to him in the first place [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=869.2s)]
*  He was playing golf with him in New Jersey yesterday morning. Yeah, but [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  Who else was Trump sitting next to Tucker Carlson who hates those people with a passion who came out and gave one of the most [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=878.6s)]
*  Revelatory revelatory obscene and frank [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  Condemnations of Lindsey I've ever seen come from anyone and basically said hey yesterday morning, man [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=892.24s)]
*  You know you were trying to kill this Vance nomination and now you're you know doing a selfie riding in a car with him you hypocrite [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=899.12s)]
*  Here's here's the bit [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=907.0s)]
*  Here's the basic reason why I'm a bit skeptical [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  And I do roll my eyes a little bit about all this chatter of populist nationalism [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=911.68s)]
*  And that's now been solidified because Trump picked Vance [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=916.3599999999999s)]
*  Trump and Vance Vance are kind of just nebulous in the same way [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=921.4799999999999s)]
*  I think in that Vance can easily accommodate himself to whatever the mainstream consensus is within the party [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=924.52s)]
*  So he had no issue basically [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=931.56s)]
*  Overturning his previous identity as anti-trump or never Trump and you know gradually acclimated to the Trump [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=934.04s)]
*  Cause which is not new for a politician, but he did it [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=941.3199999999999s)]
*  skillfully and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=944.88s)]
*  I don't know like in 2022. I covered a little bit of Vance running for the Senate in Ohio [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=946.88s)]
*  He was never opposed to Ukraine funding [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=951.8s)]
*  He actually said the opposite now the media portrayed him as in Putin's pocket or all this other nonsense [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=953.7199999999999s)]
*  But he said I have no multiple quotes. I reposted them yesterday where he says no, of course [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=957.8399999999999s)]
*  We just send weapons to Ukraine. So he doesn't have any principle aversion to that stuff [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=961.96s)]
*  I did the Rukin or when he was running for Senate was not a hot war with Russia. Yes. It was 2022 [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=965.84s)]
*  Well, it's gone on for a while no the Ukraine the invasion of Ukraine was February 2022 [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=976.84s)]
*  The midterm is a 2022 is when Vance got elected, right? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=981.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't think a lot of people would have opposed going into Afghanistan that year [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=985.0s)]
*  But six years later [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=990.36s)]
*  Maybe not there are a lot of expectations for how things were gonna go in Ukraine [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=993.6s)]
*  And a couple years later where they're still throwing 60 billion dollars at a time at the job and getting nowhere [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=999.56s)]
*  And do we know who executed or was critical in seeing to it that that 61 billion was passed in April? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1006.52s)]
*  It still amazes me that nobody covers this Donald Trump. Talk to Kevin Kramer senator from North Dakota. Who's here [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1012.68s)]
*  I just talked to him again yesterday [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1018.32s)]
*  He Lindsey Graham and Mike Johnson were this and Mark Wayne Mullen were the circuits for Trump in the Congress to get that Ukraine [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1019.8000000000001s)]
*  funding bill passed in April because otherwise the House caucus in particular would have been [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1026.68s)]
*  Restive and Trump signaling that he was down with that Ukraine funding [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1032.76s)]
*  Made it so that it was politically palatable for Republicans including Johnson [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  Who are the most responsive to Trump's political influence to get that passed? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1041.28s)]
*  So I mean that that's in the record then that they can say stuff whatever they want, right? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1045.12s)]
*  And you can claim that you have this, you know generalized generic aversion to foreign policy interventionism [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1049.9199999999998s)]
*  Or the military industrial complex, but I don't know Trump installed a top Raytheon lobbyist as his defense secretary [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1056.8s)]
*  Why should I not look at Trump's actual record like what he's actually done with his power [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1063.08s)]
*  In evaluating the question of whether he is this [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  Antagonist or the deep state rather than than these like wish casting projections of what like he might do if you know the pure [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1071.2s)]
*  Untarnished version of Trump's wherever to emerge. I hear that and look I agree with you look [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1078.2s)]
*  in some sense [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1083.96s)]
*  Also with the FISA issue like the Trump support was critical and getting that awful bill passed, right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1086.2s)]
*  I'm Aga Mike Johnson as Trump nicknamed it exactly [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1091.8799999999999s)]
*  However, you know Michael you and I both spent a lot of time on the Russia gate story we did right and [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1096.42s)]
*  At the very least what Trump represents is not that right like he's not gonna be prosecuting himself for a phony [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1104.3400000000001s)]
*  conspiracy with Russia and [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1112.3400000000001s)]
*  If if we look at you know, what happened in you know, the winter of 2021 to 2022 [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1114.38s)]
*  With Nord Stream with all kinds of other things [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1121.1000000000001s)]
*  Do we think do we really think that Trump would have ended up in this shooting war place with with Russia? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1124.38s)]
*  It's a counterfactual and that's what the Republicans rely on it never would have happened like Trump when instead of that's what politics relies on [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1131.26s)]
*  I know politics is about counterfactuality. It's like here's what the time I'm asking for his position [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1137.5800000000002s)]
*  It's when instead of just letting Trump ramble and say it never would have happened if I was there [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1143.3400000000001s)]
*  He says Israel never would have happened Ukraine never would have happened, you know what? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1147.94s)]
*  I thought that it that enables him to never express an actual policy position [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1151.56s)]
*  I'll solve the war in 24 hours with who Lindsey Graham you here. Here's here's I think the basic difference [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1155.18s)]
*  You still think it's a policy thing. Trump doesn't look at the politics in terms of policy [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1161.18s)]
*  He looks at it in terms of deals and negotiations keeping his options open and striking the deal at the time [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1165.98s)]
*  I don't know that [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1171.48s)]
*  You're right [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1173.96s)]
*  He has any fundamental hostility to some of these groups that he might your his supporters might speak against [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1175.88s)]
*  But I think what he's telling us is if I the master negotiator were in there [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1181.8400000000001s)]
*  I could drive a deal that these guys aren't getting [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1186.28s)]
*  and and that's [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1189.8s)]
*  Anathema to the usual political way of thinking where everything's based on policies and announcing yourself and so on and Trump's more like [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1191.28s)]
*  You know, let me get in there [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1198.6000000000001s)]
*  at the table and do something and [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1201.2s)]
*  Also, I'm an intimidating guy what he's usually saying in those speeches is when Trump's president [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1204.2s)]
*  He'll our enemies will be intimidated in a way. They just haven't been right, but that's sort of like a hero worship thing [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1211.1000000000001s)]
*  Like we don't need to know what his policy prescriptions are [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1215.88s)]
*  We just need them in there the way the rule worse world used to be ruled before we had George Town [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1218.1200000000001s)]
*  You know schools of foreign policy. It used to be ruled through intimidation [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  negotiation [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1228.8400000000001s)]
*  And struggle and and Trump is a throwback in that sense [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1230.56s)]
*  You also have to look at other things like, you know [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1235.48s)]
*  I spent a lot of the last two or three years on the digital censorship issue, right now we know [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  How the Democrats feel about that? I mean they're all like a thousand percent committed to you know, a full throttle [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1245.12s)]
*  version of as much control as they can get over [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  The internet over, you know media distribution all those things even [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  integrating that with [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1262.9199999999998s)]
*  Laws overseas like the Digital Services Act all the all the five eyes countries except for the United States have pretty intense [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  digital censorship laws now [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1271.52s)]
*  Is that going to be true under Trump? You know, maybe that's possible [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1274.12s)]
*  But we know for an absolute fact that it's that it's trending in a terrible direction in the other way, right and so [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1277.9399999999998s)]
*  You're right. Nobody has to ask Trump questions even if he answered them you wouldn't believe it, right? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1285.3600000000001s)]
*  All you can do is make calculated guesses about who's gonna be worse in these issues and you know with something like [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1292.64s)]
*  for instance Ukraine and Crimea and all that [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1299.8400000000001s)]
*  there are differences in how [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1303.2s)]
*  different politicians pursue those Barack Obama made a very different decision than the Biden administration made right and [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1305.88s)]
*  And Trump made a different decision than Obama by sending Ukraine lethal weaponry for the first time, right? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1312.1200000000001s)]
*  Exactly, but and which was reported exactly the opposite, right? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1317.44s)]
*  Yeah, it was reported erroneously as you would I pointed out at the time, right? Right. Yes [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1320.8000000000002s)]
*  They didn't invade under him [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1326.68s)]
*  But they encroached I mean this idea that the world was just this oasis of peace and tranquility under Trump [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1329.4s)]
*  I think is a ridiculous talking point [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1335.4s)]
*  I mean the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1337.5600000000002s)]
*  bombings [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1339.0s)]
*  Yeah, he escalated in Afghanistan. You know what? I do believe him on he just recently admitted on a Fox interview [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1340.0800000000002s)]
*  And then in some other interview that he was never actually gonna withdraw from Afghanistan [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1346.2800000000002s)]
*  He said he was gonna maintain a force presence at Bagram airbase and therefore effectively keep occupying Afghanistan a perpetuity [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1349.88s)]
*  Trump dropped the record number of bombs on Afghanistan in 2018 [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1356.8000000000002s)]
*  So seven years 17 years after 9-eleven [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  So, I don't know I just get frustrated that nobody like looks at the record of what he actually did when the guy wielded power [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1363.78s)]
*  It's like he's just this mythological figure who just floats in the ether and we just have to hope for things [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1368.74s)]
*  Well, we have four years worth of data, right? But Michael what? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1373.46s)]
*  people are voting on they're they're looking at a bad choice and [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1378.22s)]
*  You know another choice that where we have [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1382.94s)]
*  You know a wealth of concrete information [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1385.54s)]
*  Where we know what what is happening right now, I mean I don't they're gonna do Nord stream under Trump [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1388.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't see that happening [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1395.82s)]
*  He bragged about how he ended Nord stream by sanctioning it or he was about to right [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1398.54s)]
*  But is he gonna blow it up and you know, who knows, you know, I he wanted to get rid of Nord stream [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1403.36s)]
*  He wanted to cut off that the supply of [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1408.6s)]
*  You know energy I don't want it to turn into you know, who can make the best case for Donald Trump [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1411.02s)]
*  peacenik, but [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1417.6599999999999s)]
*  As I understand his argument, it's I'm an intimidating figure [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1419.74s)]
*  I have a kind of madman charisma [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1425.5s)]
*  that others [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1428.8999999999999s)]
*  Respect and we've had these encroachments not because I'm a peacenik, but because they're afraid I'll go ape on them and [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1431.02s)]
*  not [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1439.4199999999998s)]
*  you know not do the forever war formula and and and his and his [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1440.5s)]
*  Crown jewel in that respect is killing so many, you know [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1445.74s)]
*  Hey, I shut up a ramp pretty quickly didn't I with one lethal swift move that everybody told me was gonna cause World War [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1449.78s)]
*  But instead settled things down and I think that's the thing he points to [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1457.06s)]
*  But now what what did Mike Johnson say when he was asked to explain why he and Trump got the FISA renewal in April [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1461.6200000000001s)]
*  He said I'll tell you he said that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1468.34s)]
*  Trump Donald Trump and I agreed that we want him to be the one presiding over [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1470.86s)]
*  FISA when it next comes up for renewal in two years [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1475.62s)]
*  So what does that indicate to you about his attitude toward the security state-rear large? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1478.06s)]
*  It's not that he has any kind of principled aversion to it [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1481.46s)]
*  He wants to be the one presiding over it, right? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1484.06s)]
*  And that's one of the arguments that I've made and saying that people need to oppose it [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1486.06s)]
*  But all of this Michael, it's kind of to me. It's kind of irrelevant [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1489.86s)]
*  We're not I'm not really interested in making a case for against all [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1494.4199999999998s)]
*  The [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1498.46s)]
*  Deal with this election is is that the die has been cast in terms of the campaign [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1499.98s)]
*  Democrats have essentially forfeited the right to be believed on all these issues [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1507.02s)]
*  And now you know what's gonna happen is Trump's most likely gonna be elected [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1511.3000000000002s)]
*  And then I think what what you're going to see is people are going to finally I [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1515.5800000000002s)]
*  Hope hold him to all of his various promises about that [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1522.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, no, but but the problem [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1527.14s)]
*  You couldn't do it really in his the first four years of his presidency [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1531.3000000000002s)]
*  Because they were piling on so many other things that were wrong [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1536.26s)]
*  That it was very difficult to to you know in real time [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1541.3000000000002s)]
*  Consider accurately [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1547.14s)]
*  Gauge who Donald Trump was plus they didn't want you to criticize Trump on the grounds of well [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1549.14s)]
*  He's not living up to his populist promises [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1553.86s)]
*  They were I tried to to but I was alone by voice in the right, right? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1556.82s)]
*  But we never got the chance. You know what I mean? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1560.4199999999998s)]
*  We never got the chance because they launched this bullshit [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1562.82s)]
*  Onslaught against him that ate up everything and and you know did put him I think [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1565.82s)]
*  Mmm in some favorable way in the role of the bullied one [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1572.78s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm gonna opposition because as Matt knows well [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1577.62s)]
*  I was one of the very few people with even any media adjacency who was really early covering the flaws and the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1580.42s)]
*  illogicality of the whole Russiagate thing and yet now I now find myself in a position where I'm commonly trying to [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1587.22s)]
*  Counter some of this mythology that's built around Trump as this like martyred [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1595.22s)]
*  Opponent of the deep state in a way. I think just exaggerates [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1599.74s)]
*  the impact of that whole episode now, yes Trump was I [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1603.5800000000002s)]
*  Did have machinations against him elements of the national security say that's not disputable [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1608.7s)]
*  But that does that metaphor make him like this existential threat to the CIA or something? No, I mean read this project 2025 thing [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1612.7s)]
*  they just want to do some bureaucratic reorganization so that the [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1619.74s)]
*  security state services better [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1623.82s)]
*  Promote American primacy. I mean and that kind of but with Trump being the one who is [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1627.22s)]
*  Above it all. I mean that seems to be the ultimate ambition there. So just to take an example [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1632.54s)]
*  Of in the censorship realm [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1637.26s)]
*  the Department of Defense has a new thing called like the Office of [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1640.42s)]
*  Narrative intelligence or something like that. It's headquartered in Mississippi Senator Roger wicker got a lot a bunch of DOD money [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1645.54s)]
*  Directed for that and it's kind of like the Republican answer to [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1653.74s)]
*  You know the Stanford based [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1658.26s)]
*  Yeah, and [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1661.02s)]
*  What they claim they want to do is [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1662.86s)]
*  Create a single hub of [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1665.9s)]
*  Where there's one [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1669.62s)]
*  Place in the Pentagon that's overseeing all the the kind of narrative control efforts [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1671.62s)]
*  out there and [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1677.98s)]
*  The technology was originally designed to be used mostly overseas against terrorists and that sort of thing [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1679.86s)]
*  It's now obviously being directed inward shot her right and so they claim that you know, once they [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1686.14s)]
*  Come in back into power what if they're able to do it that they're going to end this [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1695.3s)]
*  encroachment by the security state into domestic affairs and go back to being what they were before which was you know a [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1702.22s)]
*  Death star like force around the world that you know fixed elections and assassinated people without but not here, right? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1710.46s)]
*  and so the I think for a lot of Trump voters the line is [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1717.58s)]
*  Yes, the CIA [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1722.54s)]
*  Pentagon it's bad. They do all kinds of terrible things, but they never crossed the line into [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1725.1s)]
*  meddling with domestic politics in the way that they have in the last eight years and [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1730.86s)]
*  The implicit promise of the Trump administration is that he's not going to do that now. I [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1735.6999999999998s)]
*  Don't know that he that that will be true [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1741.62s)]
*  And if he does do that if we start seeing Russia gates flipped on on, you know [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1744.5s)]
*  Democratic politicians [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1749.54s)]
*  Politicians who say Joe Biden he's the Manchurian candidate of China or the mayor of Moscow pays Joe Biden or I mean [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1751.74s)]
*  It doesn't seem like he has any [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1759.22s)]
*  principled [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1762.02s)]
*  Antipathy toward the idea of I kind of ginning up one of these foreign influence [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1763.94s)]
*  Scandals are just can he deploy the power of the state behind it. Maybe another question. Yes [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1769.22s)]
*  He happens to be having to be telling the truth in that respect [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1774.78s)]
*  Which one? Hunter Biden? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1778.26s)]
*  He ran on the... That's not me when he was alleging but go ahead [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1780.46s)]
*  Like for instance, I was at all those those one of the reasons I didn't vote for Trump in [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1783.86s)]
*  In 2016 one of the many reasons was that I was in the crowds when he was doing the lock lock her up chance [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1788.34s)]
*  And I thought [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1794.98s)]
*  Maybe he's gonna do that, you know, that would be insane if he did that, you know president locking up political enemies [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1796.54s)]
*  Totally unacceptable even to imply doing it, right? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1803.1s)]
*  But you got into office and didn't try right so, you know, there's there's a [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1806.9s)]
*  some small amount of evidence that I just think he's [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1812.94s)]
*  Maybe a little bit more calculating in terms of you know, how they use the security state [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1816.78s)]
*  What's what's happened in the last eight years has been so such a radical departure from the norm [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1823.22s)]
*  That I think any step backward from that is gonna be acceptable to his voters [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1828.46s)]
*  I just don't think there's any good reason to suppose that Joe Biden is a Manchurian [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1833.54s)]
*  Candidate of China while he's encircling China militarily [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1838.7s)]
*  Fledging he'll go to war with China over Taiwan. Is he trying to put Biden in jail for being him? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1841.82s)]
*  No, he's not he's not I'm just saying that he you know, he obviously dabbles in these ridiculous, you know [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1846.62s)]
*  There is you studied the Hunter Biden laptop [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1850.62s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1853.38s)]
*  Joe Biden's a Manchurian candidate so Hunter Biden saying, you know, I'm sitting here, you know [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1855.38s)]
*  We've got we've got the head of Chinese intelligence on board for this and that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1859.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm doing this a couple billion dollar deal and so I [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1864.26s)]
*  Certainly not we're been reflected at all in the Biden administration's policy toward China. It's more hawkers than Trump's [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1868.86s)]
*  So like where are they getting for their money if they're paying him to be a Manchurian candidate? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1874.6599999999999s)]
*  So you're saying he's corrupt but he's not he but he's not helping [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1877.9399999999998s)]
*  I there's just the way that Biden is wielded power in terms of policy toward China does not give any indication that he's a Manchurian candidate [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1881.9399999999998s)]
*  I don't think well the Manchurian candidate just to you know [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1889.54s)]
*  Refresh your pop culture memory is someone who doesn't emerge until the last minute. They have perfect cover [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1893.42s)]
*  but [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1899.46s)]
*  You know, they make their move at the at the opportune moment, but I am what is the China's? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1901.02s)]
*  So I am biting the emerge charge that there that charge that there have been untoward dealings between the Biden family and the Chinese [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1906.32s)]
*  You know business and political elite is not something that Trump made up [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1913.74s)]
*  Michael I would love to go back to a world where I get to criticize the president for being over [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1919.18s)]
*  aggressive militarily abroad [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1926.82s)]
*  you know for [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1929.46s)]
*  Not living up to his campaign promises [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1932.06s)]
*  you know to I [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1935.58s)]
*  Don't know traditional forms of corruption maybe like of a financial sort [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1937.7s)]
*  But that wasn't what we dealt with in the last eight years [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1943.9s)]
*  We dealt with sort of a fundamental assault on how [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1946.0s)]
*  Reality was constructed [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1950.52s)]
*  you know there was a [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1952.44s)]
*  unprecedented types of digital propaganda were you know [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1954.68s)]
*  spread in the population [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1959.4s)]
*  and you know the use of [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1961.56s)]
*  The law enforcement apparatus in the courts to go after political enemies this whole lawfare movement [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1964.4s)]
*  You know, which is is not a fake thing. It's a real thing [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1970.72s)]
*  Mass lawsuits the project 65 thing which is going after anybody who was a [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1973.92s)]
*  Trump lawyer, you know, that's sort of a direct assault in the Sixth Amendment [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1980.64s)]
*  I mean all the amendments run under a server when they raided Michael Cohen's office and basically eliminated [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1984.0s)]
*  Here's the difference between the two things that we're talking about to me laid bare [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1992.76s)]
*  I [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=1997.8799999999999s)]
*  Trump call, you know Trump me called Joe Biden a Manchurian candidate and use some rhetoric [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2000.08s)]
*  Maybe there's some half-assed congressional probes [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2007.28s)]
*  But when they called Trump the Moscow [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2012.24s)]
*  candidate [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2016.32s)]
*  They got a full-scale [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2018.48s)]
*  investigation that gripped America every night with Robert Mueller and a big budget and [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2020.48s)]
*  You know bogus convictions and bogus trials [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2026.2s)]
*  Promising indictments by the Ides of March. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and so and so, you know one may be [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2030.92s)]
*  overheated rhetoric against Joe Biden, but the other was a full-scale operation that [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2038.76s)]
*  Kind of poisoned the country and poisoned journalism. I agree with that [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2044.8s)]
*  I mean, I shouldn't be misconstrued as drawing like a perfect equivalence between these things which I'm not doing [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2048.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm I probably I covered more in depth than most people like the unprecedented nature of those security state [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2054.08s)]
*  machinations against I just think I would I would [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2061.64s)]
*  Be I would love to have a conventionally shitty president [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2065.48s)]
*  As opposed to this other thing that it's just it's impossible even to figure out what it is that's going on now [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2069.56s)]
*  You know and that's that's [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2074.74s)]
*  Where I am, you know Trump be you know [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2077.36s)]
*  Not living up to his word Trump [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2081.12s)]
*  lying about [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2083.48s)]
*  You know being an anti-war candidate [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2084.7999999999997s)]
*  He might just you know be slightly less [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2087.48s)]
*  Aggressive in terms of starting crazy wars that that are you know, actually lead us to the brink of nuclear [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2091.7599999999998s)]
*  Catastrophe I think I think his line has sort of been I have a big beautiful [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2098.52s)]
*  Militaire with the Space Force and everything but I'm gonna use it less because it's big beautiful and scared. That's just Ronald Reagan though [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2102.16s)]
*  I mean, that's nothing new [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2108.74s)]
*  Believe it I mean and I say this is someone who just couldn't stand them growing up [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2111.74s)]
*  But Ronald Reagan is a big step up from where we are right now [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2116.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean, I think we're in this this place for institutionally where there are so many crazy things going on [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2119.8599999999997s)]
*  I personally would be glad for a step back from that [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2127.18s)]
*  I guess part of my frustration and we'll wrap up soon is just that I wish more [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2130.66s)]
*  journalists were inclined to [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2134.9399999999996s)]
*  Be genuinely impartial toward like the two major party candidates in the sense that like have reasoned criticism of both [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2137.38s)]
*  Don't have like a partisan rooting interest. I'm not accusing you guys of having that obviously [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2144.2200000000003s)]
*  But I just like there's you know when we abolish journalistic objectivity [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2147.26s)]
*  I initially was kind of in favor of that because it had this like stuffy ideology [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2150.94s)]
*  Where you had to like pretend that you had dope opinions on anything, right and that became untenable with the advent of social media [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2155.5s)]
*  But I don't know the part of me like want wishes like there are more just cook or much more [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2161.9s)]
*  Like just like just legitimately did a hate and oppose everyone [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2165.62s)]
*  So that they wouldn't feel like they had to have this like, you know fidelity to [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2169.3399999999997s)]
*  You are identifying the problem in some ways [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2174.02s)]
*  You weren't allowed if you were less than enthusiastic about this culture war you were accused of being pro-trump [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2178.14s)]
*  You know, I got it every day. Yeah, I know same here [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2185.8599999999997s)]
*  and and just because I'm willing to enter a [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2189.98s)]
*  And just because I'm willing to entertain arguments on both sides of the question in terms of Donald Trump [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2193.5s)]
*  Doesn't only in this era does that look like some kind of endorsement? Yeah exactly, you know [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2201.1800000000003s)]
*  So how about on the on the Democrats before I came here from DC and I was covering the Senate Democrats [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2207.02s)]
*  Crisis meeting they met right off Capitol Hill in the Dennett's [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2214.82s)]
*  Senate [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2219.46s)]
*  Democratic senatorial campaign committee office. I think that's the correct acronym [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2220.82s)]
*  SDS CC or something who knows and I am not exaggerating the slightest [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2224.9s)]
*  I was watching the Democratic senators exit the building and then either walk into their office or walk toward the Capitol [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2230.26s)]
*  They look like they saw a ghost Sheldon Whitehouse. He looked just in despair [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2235.3s)]
*  Chris Murphy, he almost couldn't talk and he's just just mumbling look depressed [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2239.94s)]
*  Mark Warner just scuttled out of there and he they look dour [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2245.9s)]
*  Genuinely, and I never seen anything quite like it. So I [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2251.26s)]
*  Don't know. Are we now in a I kind of had doubted that the odds of a Biden withdrawal were as high as like some of the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2255.7400000000002s)]
*  Conventional wisdom suggested because a lot of the Democratic elites or insiders or pundits [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2262.06s)]
*  They eventually wanted that to happen. So they were trying to materialize it because I thought there was only shot beating Trump, right? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2266.46s)]
*  That gave like a little bit of an exaggerated impression of how I hide the odds were but so they were higher than you would expect [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2273.02s)]
*  For a common president, obviously in a vacuum. They were really high, you know in the grand scheme of things [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2278.34s)]
*  but now it seems like that's just been zapped by the [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2282.94s)]
*  assassination attempts and and buttons [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2286.82s)]
*  No, I mean the attempt to remove him or the attempt to force him to withdraw has been zapped or collapsed or frozen [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2290.9s)]
*  Yeah, so now it seems like there's very few [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2298.34s)]
*  Very little chance of it and they might move up the Democratic roll call vote [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2301.2200000000003s)]
*  That's customarily supposed to be at the convention, but now they're gonna do it virtually [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2305.7799999999997s)]
*  They were in response hadn't finalized it yet electoral technicality but [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2312.8599999999997s)]
*  so one thing I heard last night here was [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2318.4599999999996s)]
*  If the Democrats are gonna burn a candidate if they feel like they're gonna lose to Trump [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2323.3399999999997s)]
*  Why don't they just burn the one who's burning out anyway, you know [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2327.9799999999996s)]
*  And I think that's crazy because they could still win the election easily I think but [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2332.3199999999997s)]
*  They could but not with Biden not it would be very difficult with Biden, you know [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2338.7999999999997s)]
*  But but Biden, you know the big campaign story in 2020 that was overlooked for a long time [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2344.0s)]
*  Is how stubborn his support was people not by Michael Michael was you know, I [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2349.8399999999997s)]
*  Never gonna argue with him for too long [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2356.16s)]
*  Because I remember when he was only voice who said, you know [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2358.96s)]
*  This Biden thing's gonna work and he looked at the numbers and he looked at the kind of support he had and he [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2363.7999999999997s)]
*  Properly predicted the results of the election [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2369.44s)]
*  Against a lot of people who were doing a lot of skits II neurotic and including the Democratic primaries [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2372.8799999999997s)]
*  Exactly because you remember Biden was one of the only major candidate who really didn't have a vocal social media support base [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2378.52s)]
*  Bernie obviously did even more to some extent the Kamala people have one but Biden [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2384.7999999999997s)]
*  Biden's most core supporters would be like, you know religious elderly black people in the south who are not, you know lighting Twitter on fire [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2390.08s)]
*  so it kind of gave a skewed picture of [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2398.02s)]
*  Biden's from inability I felt and you know, I'm not saying Biden is formidable now [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2401.36s)]
*  But he doesn't have a track record of that being so and there are a lot of people who are just never gonna vote anything [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2405.48s)]
*  And that's it's a very high number of people so they're they're still very much in it [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2411.04s)]
*  I think the the problem is they have no vision and they're completely packed. There's a total paralysis [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2416.28s)]
*  That that's probably what you're witnessing. Yeah that event is they have no idea what move to make now [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2422.56s)]
*  They've exhausted all the things that they think are legitimate moves and the only thing they can do now [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2428.48s)]
*  It's the thing they should have done eight years ago, which is think well [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2433.12s)]
*  How can we make a better pitch to ordinary people about what our vision is for the future and they just don't they haven't had one [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2436.0s)]
*  their whole thing has been running against Trump's negatives and [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2442.48s)]
*  It hasn't worked that is backfired completely. So, you know, maybe they'll reemerge with a new [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2445.88s)]
*  Yeah, the threat to our democracy line. I saw some story today [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2452.76s)]
*  They're eager to return to it boy [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2456.88s)]
*  You know like a dog to its vomit that that's not gonna work [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2459.48s)]
*  The Thursday night team at the Republican Convention is a new golden age for America [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2463.36s)]
*  So so Trump's gonna go we talked about Reagan tonight Trump's gonna go Reagan ask the shining city on the hill, you know [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2468.34s)]
*  The sort of tech assisted AI driven maybe Peter Thiel and Elon Musk [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2476.36s)]
*  You know powered future of America [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2482.48s)]
*  Yeah, we have a go Lockheed Martin ad [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2488.08s)]
*  Yeah, so so what do they have to counter that [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2491.04s)]
*  Carbon credits Green New Deal [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2497.52s)]
*  He's gonna end in ten in ten minutes [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2500.3999999999996s)]
*  He's flipped a script on him. He's not gonna be the dystopian candidate after the Golden Age speech [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2503.52s)]
*  The real inspiring slogan should be we said democracy was gonna end last time and it didn't but we promise this time. It's really gonna end [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2508.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, you said you guys are into speech very listen the last little thing because my you jogged my memory [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2516.48s)]
*  Something I wanted to bring up [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2522.2s)]
*  I'm into unfettered the free speech. It's like the best thing about the American system of government First Amendment, etc [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2525.44s)]
*  But now you have people in the aftermath of this assassination. They're saying, you know, look Joe Biden once said we have to put Donald Trump in [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2533.28s)]
*  the bullseye [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2539.6s)]
*  Meaning change the conversation away from his poor debate performance and redirect the focus into Trump [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2540.9s)]
*  You have people say oh, we got to dial down the rhetoric. We have to turn down the temperature, right? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2546.42s)]
*  And I don't know if this seems like she speaks [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2552.26s)]
*  No, the Republicans are saying about the Democratic rhetoric toward Trump because they're saying that they overheated [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2556.1800000000003s)]
*  Democratic rhetoric about Trump could have inspired the assassination [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2560.78s)]
*  So so I and here's what I object to so I think all the overblown Democratic rhetoric about Trump is [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2564.26s)]
*  Substantively incorrect, right and I've been saying that since 2015 [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2569.86s)]
*  But I also think people are allowed to have alarmist hysterical. Yeah [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2574.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2580.34s)]
*  perceptions of political figures and not be accused of being complicit in [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2582.38s)]
*  Assassination attempts that they had no operational [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2586.98s)]
*  Rollin so like how do you how do you think about that speech dynamics? I'm a little bit [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2589.5s)]
*  Wary of how [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2594.9s)]
*  Favor of suppressing. Yeah that speech. I don't think that they should be algorithmically dialing down [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2597.1400000000003s)]
*  anybody who says something like [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2603.2200000000003s)]
*  You know Trump is Hitler and or and he needs to be stopped at all costs [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2605.38s)]
*  You know, this is this stochastic terrorism argument Keith Olbermann is you know had a big thing about how oh look at all [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2610.7000000000003s)]
*  The people who are suddenly discovering stochastic terrorism [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2617.46s)]
*  You I did the Twitter fall story one of the first things that we found [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2621.0s)]
*  Was that they had to construct an entirely new argument for what? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2624.72s)]
*  incitement was in order to get Trump bounced from the platform because he hadn't technically violated enough of their internal rules, so they [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2628.36s)]
*  they essentially created a stochastic terrorism argument saying that in [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2636.2799999999997s)]
*  In the aggregate looking at the totality of everything that he said it could constitute [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2640.84s)]
*  Inciting people to violence and this is what we have to take them off Twitter and [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2647.36s)]
*  You know, I think that was wrong I think it would be wrong to say [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2653.88s)]
*  You know, you can't let people say that he's a existential threat to the universe and needs to be stopped [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2659.36s)]
*  But you know people should be allowed to say that but it's but as you say I think it was basically incorrect [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2668.64s)]
*  It's it is unhealthy. I'm not for it [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2677.36s)]
*  I just don't think we should outlaw it Michael one of the reasons why you need free speech is so that people can be the [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2679.92s)]
*  Demonic assholes that they are and everybody can see them and then hold them responsible for it later [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2685.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, nobody's saying [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2691.8s)]
*  We well, maybe some are we should have prior restraint on this kind of speech [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2694.88s)]
*  But I think some people are saying, you know [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2699.6800000000003s)]
*  Hey, look at this you were telling us that when I told the proud boys to stand by or stand down or whatever [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2702.2799999999997s)]
*  I I was you know asking for a revolutionary force to back me up [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2707.7999999999997s)]
*  You're the ones who made there were good people on both sides into a soundbite and so on [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2714.64s)]
*  You're the people who caught say I caused January 6th, you know through some rhetorical [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2720.0s)]
*  Encouragement and now you're turning around and you're saying [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2728.08s)]
*  But us calling you Hitler and us calling you a threat to democracy and that doesn't have any consequences [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2732.24s)]
*  I mean, it's more as though the Republicans are turning the thing back on right? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2738.08s)]
*  So maybe it's not a matter of allowing or disallowing the speech [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2743.68s)]
*  I'm not suggesting anybody's seriously proposing to legally prohibit the speech [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2745.9599999999996s)]
*  But how about the ascription of responsibility? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2750.2799999999997s)]
*  like it's somebody who says that Trump is a threat to democracy or he's an existential threat or you know, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2752.4799999999996s)]
*  Choose your similar phrase which I again don't agree with [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2757.9599999999996s)]
*  Right [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2761.3399999999997s)]
*  Do they bear moral or ethical or political responsibility for some guy whose motive we don't even fully understand [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2762.5s)]
*  No, but yeah, but so I wrote it [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2768.8199999999997s)]
*  Obviously wrote a piece that was very critical of all the things that have been said in the last, you know [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2770.7s)]
*  eight years, but my feeling on that is that [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2775.7s)]
*  Part of the strategy with Trump was to dehumanize him and then couple it with things like, you know [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2779.58s)]
*  Violent searching his attorney's [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2787.02s)]
*  Office or [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2790.34s)]
*  You know illegal surveillance spying on his campaign. There was this dual argument that was going on [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2792.2200000000003s)]
*  He's not quite a real full person. He's not legitimately the president [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2797.7000000000003s)]
*  So we don't have to worry about rights as much like nobody thought about [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2802.28s)]
*  It's Trump it's it's it's an extreme situation. We need to think differently about this [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2807.1s)]
*  so I saw all that all that rhetoric as being tied to [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2812.58s)]
*  Kind of a power grab and therefore very dangerous, right? It's not about he's it's responsible for who you know [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2817.1s)]
*  What the motives of this person we don't know anything about [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2824.38s)]
*  What motivated that shooting or even what happened really but I do think it was incredibly dangerous [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2828.82s)]
*  Rhetoric and it was dangerous because it shifted people's idea [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2835.78s)]
*  Ideas about what is and is an appropriate use of government power [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2840.3s)]
*  You know, nobody actually believes in stochastic terrorism by the way [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2844.38s)]
*  Because if they did believe it they wouldn't let half the movies in Hollywood be made. Okay [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2849.34s)]
*  You know, it's something to eat [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2854.58s)]
*  It's a it's a it's a [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2856.06s)]
*  Cuzzle to beat your enemy with when you feel aggrieved and then one to put down and one to let and one to never apply to [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2857.58s)]
*  Hollywood [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2864.7000000000003s)]
*  And so let's put that all aside [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2865.78s)]
*  But all speech in a political arena has a political value and a political risk and [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2868.9s)]
*  One of the risks of going overboard with the demonization of your enemy is that you will lose credibility [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2874.94s)]
*  that you will overplay your hand and that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2883.02s)]
*  Something will happen to garner sympathy for that character such that [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2886.1400000000003s)]
*  You will have a boomerang effect after having made them out to be the worst thing in the world [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2890.82s)]
*  And that's you know, I think that the real consequences for the Democrats of their of their you know threat to democracy [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2895.62s)]
*  Extremist he's a dictator the new autocracy that would be Hitler is that [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2902.94s)]
*  My joke is between the people who don't believe Trump's Hitler and the people who wish he were that's a majority [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2908.8199999999997s)]
*  And and I think the Democrats have kind of lost their credibility on this and [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2916.54s)]
*  those people who are actual autocratic and [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2921.2599999999998s)]
*  Caesarists and wish Trump would get up there and fire the entire federal government and take control himself [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2925.46s)]
*  You know [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2931.46s)]
*  They made they miscalculated they should have their wad my thing has always been from the very beginning [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2933.02s)]
*  There ought to be a rational critique of Trump, which is exceedingly rare, right? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2938.06s)]
*  But is that is not served by this constant hysteria hyperbole fascism Nazi [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2942.58s)]
*  But why wouldn't they allow that right because because it countervenes [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2947.64s)]
*  Countervails the narrative that Trump actually did govern in a policy level in a rather [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2951.82s)]
*  Conventional way right, but why since the beginning of the first Trump administration were normal politics? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2957.94s)]
*  Suspended that's a deep there was some kind of epistemic rupture in 2016 that we still don't fully comprehend [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2964.42s)]
*  I yeah, and and that's been the key to the up [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2970.06s)]
*  There should have been a rational critique of Trump [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2974.1s)]
*  But they couldn't do it because the entire premise of what they did do with Trump is that this was this [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2977.1400000000003s)]
*  You know hyper evil [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2984.98s)]
*  epic figure who's in the pocket of a foreign government and a rapist and all these other things and [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2987.5s)]
*  Criminal who needs to be locked up forever the Democrats fell prey to a conspiracy theory that grew out of control [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=2995.3s)]
*  Yeah, and then what did Trump do in kind at least on a governing level? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3000.5s)]
*  And he still brags about that. He was the toughest president ever on Russia [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3005.18s)]
*  Tore up number of treaties. We don't to go down the list massive sanctions armoring Ukraine [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3009.54s)]
*  Etc etc, etc [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3014.66s)]
*  Massive military spending and where's the where's the rational critique of that among Democrats non-existent, right? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3016.58s)]
*  because and why does nobody know that he helped orchestrate the Ukraine funding in April with Johnson and Kramer and [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3021.8199999999997s)]
*  the rest is a thing right because Democrats have no substantive rational critique of that because if they if they [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3029.14s)]
*  Actually did criticize it they would realize that that's pretty in keeping with what they're also advocating at the moment and you'd have constantly be telling [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3035.22s)]
*  Your partisan side that the other side is existentially dangerously different than you right? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3041.8599999999997s)]
*  So anything that that bridges the perceived gap between the two sides that undermines their whole [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3046.94s)]
*  Reason for existence, you know one of the funniest thing Trump's [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3053.3399999999997s)]
*  He says a lot of funny things [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3057.18s)]
*  Last few months is you know, if you just left me alone to have a normal presidency [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3060.2999999999997s)]
*  Out of your hair by now [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3064.58s)]
*  If they hadn't done the thing, you know, I remember interviewing a politician who got in a lot of trouble and [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3068.98s)]
*  He said look I thought he just got convicted. No, it was somebody else, but he said look I did the things [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3077.42s)]
*  what can I say, you know and [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3082.82s)]
*  but you know if [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3085.1400000000003s)]
*  if they had just [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3086.9s)]
*  Gone on and treated Trump like any other president gone after all of his actual [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3088.82s)]
*  My Jeb Bush or something, you know, right exactly and beat the crap out of him for every single thing that he actually [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3093.42s)]
*  Did as opposed to this mythic thing that you were trying to create and but as I said the danger with the mythic thing was [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3099.2200000000003s)]
*  It didn't even have anything to do with Trump. It was about a whole new way of governing about [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3107.34s)]
*  the relationship of the government to the public all of that stuff and [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3112.34s)]
*  That just needs to go right and if we can just get back to [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3117.1800000000003s)]
*  You know [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3121.46s)]
*  Judging presidents by their behavior and by their actual policy. I think that's a win. Yeah [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UZtuoiwZw&t=3122.6600000000003s)]
