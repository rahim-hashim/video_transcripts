# Foreign Policy Reshuffle REVEALS MAGA Split Over War With Iran
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ)
*  And there's a lot of reporting that the team around Trump has been divided when it comes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to the extremely vital question. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=10.8s)]
*  I think there's a more important foreign policy question, certainly right now, and probably [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=12.88s)]
*  we won't have one for the next four years, let's hope not, then the possibility that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=18.28s)]
*  the United States, with Israeli pressure, will go and bomb and attack Iran and then [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=22.36s)]
*  easily escalate because Iran has lots of retaliatory and escalatory options. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=29.08s)]
*  So there are a lot of people in Trump's world who are saying, this is madness, you have [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=33.76s)]
*  to reach a deal with Iran. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  And then other people say, no, this is the opportunity to get Iran finally, to bomb them, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=38.48s)]
*  even change the regime. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  And Mike Walz was clearly in the more hawkish, war seeking camp. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Here from Axios, just as one example, Trump's team, Trump's team, our team's Iran divide [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  dialogue versus detonation to end the nuclear threat. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=54.64s)]
*  Quote, President Trump has vowed to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, but inside [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  his national security team, there's a divide over the best way to do it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=61.88s)]
*  Officials are divided over which route is more likely to be successful, but they agree [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=66.12s)]
*  that without a deal, there will likely be a war. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=69.8s)]
*  One camp, unofficially led by Vice President J.D. Vance, believes a diplomatic solution [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=73.48s)]
*  is preferable and possible and that the US should be ready to make compromises in order [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=79.56s)]
*  to make it happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=83.16s)]
*  Vance is highly involved in the Iran policy discussions and other US officials said this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=85.08s)]
*  camp, the one trying to avoid war with Iran, also includes Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=91.08s)]
*  who represented the US at the first round of Iran talks on Saturday, and Secretary of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=96.04s)]
*  Defense Pete Hegseth. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  It also gets outside support from MAGA influencer and Trump whisperer Tucker Carlson, lots of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  effort to go around the term journalist, and as well, Steve Bannon is a fanatical, outspoken [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=108.6s)]
*  opponent of war with Iran. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=115.52s)]
*  And you had people like Charlie Kirk, who have been repeatedly outspoken, Donald Trump [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Jr. as well, so there's a substantial camp that is insisting that Trump will ruin his [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=121.44s)]
*  presidency, will ruin his legacy if he drags the US into another Middle East war, and Israel's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=127.36s)]
*  urging. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=132.2s)]
*  This group, the ones avoiding, trying to avoid a war, is concerned that striking Iran's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=132.76s)]
*  nuclear facilities would put US soldiers in the region in harm's way when Iran strikes [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=138.12s)]
*  back. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  The other side, the other camp, includes National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=148.84s)]
*  They're highly suspicious of Iran and extremely skeptical of the chances of a deal that significantly [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=150.2s)]
*  rolls back Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  And the other side, the other side, includes leaders close to Trump like Lindsey Graham, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=158.04s)]
*  Republican of South Carolina, and Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, also hold that view. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=162.84s)]
*  This camp believes Iran is weaker than ever and therefore the US should not compromise [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=167.64s)]
*  but instead insist Tehran fully dismantle its nuclear program and should either strike [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=172.04s)]
*  Iran directly or support an Israeli strike if they don't. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=177.56s)]
*  The chances that Iran is going to give up their nuclear program entirely is zero. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=181.24s)]
*  The chances of that are zero. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=187.56s)]
*  Iran has long made that clear that it's a non-starter for them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=190.12s)]
*  They will not do that under any circumstances. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=193.16s)]
*  They demand the right to use nuclear energy, to have nuclear reactors, and they've long [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=196.2s)]
*  insisted they're not trying to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=202.04s)]
*  They had inspectors all around one of those facilities and surveillance every day, which [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=203.8s)]
*  they agreed to as part of the Iran deal that President Obama entered into with Iran along [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=210.12s)]
*  with the Europeans and the Russians and which Trump insisted was too weak of a deal and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=215.16s)]
*  therefore he vowed in the 2016 campaign trail that he would immediately nullify the Iran [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=219.96s)]
*  deal, which the Israelis hated from the day it was signed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  And he did that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=227.72s)]
*  He nullified the Iran deal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=228.28s)]
*  All the inspectors went away and it made Iran more capable of developing a nuclear weapon [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=230.44s)]
*  because they weren't being watched anymore. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  And it should be noted that Biden spent four years nominally as President Biden and that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  administration did not renew the Iran deal with the Iranians. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=244.52s)]
*  They didn't try and institute a new deal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  They were very pro-Israel, that administration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=253.8s)]
*  And so now Trump is in the position of either having to get another deal with them that he [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  has to prove is much stronger than the one Obama got since Trump went around saying forever [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=261.88s)]
*  that that was too weak, that that wasn't sufficient and actually withdrew from that deal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=266.36s)]
*  He has to get a deal that is enough to be able to say that that's much stronger than [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=269.88s)]
*  the one Obama got but not so strong that the Iranians won't accept it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  He has to try and find the sweet spot, which won't be easy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=277.48s)]
*  And their first Iran deal was very delicately and laboriously negotiated. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  And then they're pretty much stuck with the idea of bombing Iran if they can't get an [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  agreement because Trump has long said we will go to war as a way to prevent Iran from getting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  nuclear weapons, which will happen if he says there's no deal. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=294.12s)]
*  So that's the position that they're in and that's the breakdown of the debate. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=299.08s)]
*  And there's no question, in my mind, none, that Trump desperately wants a deal with Iran. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=307.24s)]
*  He does not want to have to participate in a war, get dragged into an Israeli war. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=312.68s)]
*  He campaigned on the promise of being the peacemaker of avoiding wars. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=319.08s)]
*  This is something he prides himself on, notwithstanding his decision, bad decision, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=322.36s)]
*  to renew the Biden bombing campaign in the Houthis, to renew and escalate it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=327.64s)]
*  I do believe Trump cares about being perceived as the person who stopped wars and not started ones. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=334.36s)]
*  He was the one who negotiated with the Taliban to withdraw from Afghanistan. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=344.44s)]
*  He was prevented from doing so. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=349.16s)]
*  It was Biden who ended up doing so, but that was Trump's initiative to negotiate with the Taliban [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=350.36s)]
*  to finally be able to pull out of Afghanistan. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=354.44s)]
*  He clearly wants to end the war with Ukraine and Russia, and I know he wants to avoid a war with [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=358.04s)]
*  Iran. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=364.6s)]
*  The problem is that he has a lot of people pressuring him to go to war with Iran, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=365.0s)]
*  leading with the Israelis. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  Here's the New York Times on April 16th, which is the same day as that Axios article reporting [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  on the internal divisions where Mike Walz is specifically. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=373.8s)]
*  Trump waved off Israeli strike after divisions emerged in his administration. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=377.48s)]
*  Israel had planned to strike Iranian nuclear sites as soon as next month, but was waved off by [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=382.12s)]
*  President Trump in recent weeks in favor of negotiating a deal with Tehran to limit its [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=387.24s)]
*  nuclear program, according to administration officials and others briefed on the discussions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=391.48s)]
*  Mr. Trump made his decision after months of internal debate over whether to pursue diplomacy [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=395.48s)]
*  or support Israel in seeking to set back Iran's ability to build a bomb at a time when Iran has [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=400.68s)]
*  been weakened militarily and economically. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=405.96s)]
*  Israeli officials remember this is when Netanyahu visited Trump for the second time. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=409.0s)]
*  He purportedly came to talk about terrorists, but they spent all their time according to everybody [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=413.0s)]
*  on whether the US should help Israel bomb Iran, change the regime, take out all the nuclear program. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=417.32s)]
*  Israeli officials had recently developed plans to attack Iranian nuclear sites in May. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=423.64s)]
*  They were prepared to carry them out, and at times were optimistic that the US would sign off. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=427.79999999999995s)]
*  The goal of the proposals, according to officials briefed on them, was to set back [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=432.28s)]
*  Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon by a year or more. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  Almost all the plans would have required US help, but not just to defend Israel from Iranian [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=439.0s)]
*  retaliation, but also to ensure that an Israeli attack was successful, making the United States [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=444.84s)]
*  a central part of the attack itself. For now, Mr. Trump has chosen diplomacy over military action. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=449.08s)]
*  Look how often the Israelis want to start wars, but make clear that the United States has to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=456.04s)]
*  get dragged into those wars, has to protect them, has to help them bomb, has to put our own soldiers [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=461.24s)]
*  in the region, endangering them because Iran can easily strike and has done so before. Small US [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=468.2s)]
*  bases, unprotected, you're not sprawling highly protected military bases like in the Gulf States [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=475.24s)]
*  or Iraq, these are small bases of 500 or 1000 troops that are highly vulnerable. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=481.64s)]
*  And there have been strikes, not by Iran necessarily, but by groups aligned with Iran, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=489.0s)]
*  strikes on those camps that have killed American soldiers, and it's a tiny fraction of what Iran [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=492.52s)]
*  is capable of doing, and would likely do if we bombed them. So here's Israel saying, yeah, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=497.8s)]
*  put your troops in harm's way, deploy your military to fight our war against Iran, endanger your oil [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=502.84s)]
*  rigs and your military and economic assets and the lives of your citizens to fight this war that we [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=510.12s)]
*  want to fight because it's in our interest to change the regime in Iran, but we want to use you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=515.64s)]
*  for it. And clearly Trump doesn't want that, and so if you have the person that you're supposed to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=519.48s)]
*  be relying upon to give you this sage, dependable advice and counsel as your national security [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=524.76s)]
*  advisor, Mike Walz, and he's clearly pushing you to war when you don't want to go to war, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=532.36s)]
*  especially for someone like Trump that has to create tensions and resentment. Like look, this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=536.28s)]
*  person, if Trump perceived that somebody wants war, remember that those comments he made about [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=541.56s)]
*  Liz Cheney that the CNN tried to turn into a vow to assassinate her that she did too, where he was [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=548.12s)]
*  just basically saying, yeah, Liz Cheney loves war because it's never her that has to go fighting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=553.8s)]
*  them. He said she's a war pig, and let's see if she would change her mind if she's the one who has [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  to face down machine guns and rifles and the like, pointed at her face. So Trump does have this kind [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=563.56s)]
*  of personal aversion to people who too blatantly want war. Again, he's not a pacifist, he's not a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=570.92s)]
*  anti-war extremist as his Yemen bombing demonstrates. He bombed heavily in Syria and Iraq in his first [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=580.8399999999999s)]
*  term. He withdrew from the Iran deal, but if somebody seems too eager for war, he immediately [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=587.4s)]
*  starts disliking them. We've seen that pattern over and over. He got rid of John Bolton for that, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=594.2s)]
*  and there's no doubt that Mike Walz is that person, and I guess you can have that person [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=599.4s)]
*  somewhere in your orbit just to hear their voice, but when the person right next to the Oval Office, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=605.8s)]
*  they're supposed to be there kind of being the last word, and they're completely obvious. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=609.8s)]
*  They're completely on the opposite track as the one you want to go on that has to contribute to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=614.6s)]
*  your willingness to get rid of the person. Now you could say replacing Mike Walz with Marco Rubio is [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=620.2s)]
*  sort of a wash ideologically or in terms of military strategy. Marco Rubio is also, according [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=626.28s)]
*  to all these reports, in the camp that wants to go to war with Iran that doesn't believe a deal can [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=631.72s)]
*  be done. But Rubio is much slicker about it, much more cunning, much more sophisticated in how he [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=635.32s)]
*  talks about these things to make it appear like he's aligned with Trump when he really may not be, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=643.16s)]
*  and Walz just doesn't have that capability. Speaking of people who don't hide their [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=647.64s)]
*  obsession with having the U.S. perpetually involved in wars for other countries, Senator Tom Cotton [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=653.0s)]
*  said this on X two days ago, quote, President Trump said the only solution is Iran completely [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=658.4399999999999s)]
*  dismantling its program, or we should do it for them, and he's right. A nuclear Iran is a direct [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=664.92s)]
*  threat not just to our friends in the Middle East but to every American. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=669.96s)]
*  And one of the things the Israelis are doing and people like Tom Cotton are doing is they're trying [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=675.1600000000001s)]
*  to pretend that they also think a deal should be done if it can be, but they're setting the terms of [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=678.44s)]
*  the agreement purposely to be impossible, knowing that Iran would never accept it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=684.2800000000001s)]
*  After Netanyahu left the White House, he went on television in Israel and he said like, yeah, we [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=689.0s)]
*  would love an agreement. The agreement that we would accept is the Gaddafi deal, named after the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=694.04s)]
*  now murdered and deposed Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi. In the 90s, Gaddafi was told, it was [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=700.12s)]
*  actually right after the, when the war on terror commenced, when they were invading Iraq, Gaddafi [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=708.52s)]
*  was told by the U.S. and by the West, look, if you don't want to be the next Saddam Hussein, if you [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=715.88s)]
*  don't want us to invade your country and depose you, just basically disarm, give up all your [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=721.0s)]
*  real weapons, let us inspect to make sure you have, and then don't worry, we will, you'll be part of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=727.16s)]
*  us, we will guarantee your security, you won't suffer the fate of Afghanistan and Iraq where we [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=732.84s)]
*  invade you. And Gaddafi said, okay, I think that's a good deal, I'd rather have my country integrated [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=737.48s)]
*  into the world than isolated from it, so he gave up all his weapons and then 10 years later Obama and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=743.64s)]
*  France and the UK, David Cameron and Nicholas Sarkozy convinced Obama to join that war, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=751.0s)]
*  they bombed Libya with the intent of regime change, even though they denied it, and Gaddafi ended up [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=758.84s)]
*  forced out of his palace and onto the street where he was anally raped to death by an angry crowd, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=764.12s)]
*  an angry mob. So the Israelis are telling the Iranians, yeah, follow the, you'll be fine, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=768.6s)]
*  just follow the Gaddafi model, and you think Tehran is looking at what happened to Gaddafi, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=773.24s)]
*  and be like, yeah, we'll take that, we'd like to be the next Gaddafi, that sounds really good, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=778.52s)]
*  but that's what Netanyahu is doing, pretending for Trump's sake that he too would like an [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=782.76s)]
*  agreement, but setting up an agreement as the only minimally acceptable agreement that he [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=786.6s)]
*  knows that the Iranians could never and would never accept and would force Trump into the war [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=792.12s)]
*  that they really want. Here's Lindsey Graham in Tel Aviv, a place that he often is, and when he's [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=795.56s)]
*  not there, he's talking about it, meeting it with Netanyahu at one of Israel's main military [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=803.4s)]
*  installations. By the way, Israel has tons of nuclear weapons, so we're not against nuclear [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=808.36s)]
*  weapons proliferating in the Middle East, we just want to make sure Israel is the only one that keeps [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=815.4s)]
*  the military superiority, and that Iran can't be on the same level of Israel, so that Iran can't [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  deter Israel from attacking when it wants. We have to make sure Israel can attack whoever it wants, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=825.4s)]
*  whenever it wants, meaning they're the only ones with nuclear weapons. So here's Lindsey [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=830.52s)]
*  Graham in Tel Aviv, you could say up Tel Aviv, speaking with Netanyahu in February. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=833.64s)]
*  Trump administration is going to have to make a decision here very soon [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=839.72s)]
*  about the Iran nuclear program. There are two paths to take. A military path where we help Israel [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=844.68s)]
*  deliver a decisive blow against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=853.0799999999999s)]
*  I prefer that path. The second path... Do you see what he said? Very, very clear, sitting with [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=857.16s)]
*  Netanyahu saying, look, one option is to just go to war with Iran, bomb Iran, bomb the crap out of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=862.76s)]
*  their nuclear facilities, do it in partnership with our lovely close friends Israel. And then he's [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=868.92s)]
*  about to say there's a second path which would avoid war, and that's diplomacy, but Lindsey [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=874.92s)]
*  Graham was very clear, especially knowing that the Israelis were listening, saying, the path that I [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=878.76s)]
*  just laid out, the one where we just go to war with Iran, bomb Iran with the Israelis, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=884.9200000000001s)]
*  that's the one I prefer, not this diplomacy crap. And then he went on. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=888.44s)]
*  Just negotiate with Iran to try to get them to abandon their nuclear [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=892.12s)]
*  ambitions. If that path is chosen, it needs to be limited in time. We should put it on the clock [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=897.32s)]
*  and we should define what success looks like. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=906.12s)]
*  Okay. So you see these people close to Trump and what they're putting in his ear, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=908.44s)]
*  and that is very dangerous. I think Trump is resisting them for now. All accounts, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=917.1600000000001s)]
*  not just public accounts, but people I talked to who are close to the administration, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=921.48s)]
*  all say the same thing unanimously, that Trump is genuinely determined to avoid a war with Iran, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=925.48s)]
*  but he will go to war with Iran if he can't get a deal that he can boast is much stronger than the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=930.84s)]
*  one Obama got. And like I said, there are a lot of voices, important influential voices inside the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=935.16s)]
*  White House and outside who are being quite vocal and vociferous about their steadfast opposition to [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=942.12s)]
*  war with Iran. One of them is Charlie Kirk, who in early April said this, quote, it's going unnoticed [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=951.16s)]
*  because so much of their news is happening, but the war drums are beating again in DC. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=957.7199999999999s)]
*  The warmongers worry this is their last chance to get the white whale they've been chasing for [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=962.84s)]
*  30 years, which is an all out regime change war against Iran. And Charlie Kirk is a thousand [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=967.0s)]
*  percent right. That's the game. The nuclear installations are the pretext. Just like when [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=971.88s)]
*  Obama went to war in Libya, the pretext was, oh, we're going to protect the people of Benghazi. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=980.36s)]
*  Remember that? We're going to just do a no-fly zone over Benghazi to prevent Gaddafi from [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=985.0s)]
*  massacring the people of Benghazi. But don't worry, it's not regime change. And then very [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=989.16s)]
*  quickly it turned into a regime change operation. Obviously Iraq was admittedly sold as a regime [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=992.36s)]
*  change operation, but this is what they really want, regime change. That has been what they've [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=999.7199999999999s)]
*  been tasting for so long. They want to install the Chavarons utterly fell son and just restore the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1003.56s)]
*  glorious Pahlavi monarchy to the Persian state and let him be the puppet to Israel in the U.S. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1013.64s)]
*  that his father was when we installed him after we overthrew their government. That's the real dream. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1023.4s)]
*  Kirk went on, quote, a new Middle East war would be a catastrophic mistake. Our military stockpiles [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1030.6s)]
*  are depleted from the three years of backing Ukraine. And you could say Israel as well. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1035.72s)]
*  Our effort to reshore manufacturing has only just begun and will take years to bear fruit. War would [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1040.92s)]
*  worsen our already immense deficit in national debt. Iran is larger than Iraq, Syria, and [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1045.08s)]
*  Afghanistan combined. A war would not be easy and could easily become a calamity. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1050.12s)]
*  Thanks to President Trump's restraint during his first term in America, there's a golden opportunity [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1055.0s)]
*  to pull away from Middle East quagmires for good. We shouldn't throw that away again so that D.C. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1058.2s)]
*  has has been can feel tough by sending young Americans to die yet again. Just 100% endorse that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1063.4s)]
*  He's continued to say that. Whatever else you think about Charlie Kirk, that is an important voice [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1071.8s)]
*  in trying to bring a stop to a war with Iran. Tucker Carlson is an extremely important voice [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1077.72s)]
*  in that as well. And so is Steve Bannon from the New Arab in mid-April last month, quote, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1083.32s)]
*  Arrogant Netanyahu trying to pressure U.S. into Iran attacks, says Steve Bannon. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1091.6399999999999s)]
*  Speaking on his podcast, Steve Bannon said Netanyahu, quote, forced his way into meetings [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1096.44s)]
*  with Trump in a bid to win backing for a strike on Tehran's nuclear sites, quote. Trump insider Steve [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1100.6799999999998s)]
*  Bannon has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of attempting to pressure the White [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1107.24s)]
*  House to approve a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Speaking on his podcast on [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1111.08s)]
*  Thursday, Trump's former chief strategist said Netanyahu had forced his way into two meetings [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1115.48s)]
*  with the U.S. president and accused him of, quote, arrogance in trying to, quote, force the issue. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1120.44s)]
*  Netanyahu has been to Washington twice since Trump's inauguration in January in a bid to lobby the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1124.6000000000001s)]
*  White House into supporting Israel's escalation in Gaza and a major military strike on Iran. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1129.4s)]
*  You see where this pressure is coming from. From Tel Aviv, from Jerusalem, whatever you want to [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1135.16s)]
*  say is the Israeli capital. The world's divided on that. But this is a war for Israel. That's [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1141.0800000000002s)]
*  exactly what this would be and its supporters in the U.S. Here was Tucker Carlson on April 7th, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1147.4s)]
*  quote, whatever you think of tariffs, it's clear that now is the worst possible time for the United [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1153.16s)]
*  States to participate in a military strike on Iran. We can't afford it. Thousands of Americans [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1158.1200000000001s)]
*  would die. We'd lose the war that follows. Nothing would be more destructive to our country. And yet [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1163.16s)]
*  we're closer than ever thanks to unrelenting pressure from neocons. This is suicidal. Anyone [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1167.64s)]
*  advocating conflict with Iran is not an ally of the United States but rather an enemy. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1173.08s)]
*  And then two days ago, Charlie Kirk noticed that there's been these smear campaigns in the media [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1180.1999999999998s)]
*  against anybody who's in the camp of trying to prevent war with Iran. There's been smear campaigns [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1185.08s)]
*  against Peace Hex Fest, a campaign to get fired, all of his closest allies, which has been successful. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1190.28s)]
*  There's obviously been a huge coordinated smear campaign against Tucker Carlson. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1196.36s)]
*  And there's a massive campaign out to delegitimize Steve Witkoff, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1199.96s)]
*  who deserves credit for having facilitated the peace deal, the ceasefire deal that didn't hold [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1204.92s)]
*  up, but he did facilitate it. It lasted about a month between Israel and Gaza. He's also trying [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1209.24s)]
*  hard to negotiate an end to the war within Ukraine. And he is vehemently in the camp of [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1214.5200000000002s)]
*  trying to avoid war with Iran. And there's been many articles placed trying to attack Steve Witkoff [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1221.32s)]
*  as on the Russian payroll or the Qatari payroll, all the standard smears they make. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1228.52s)]
*  And one of the groups behind that is called the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1233.32s)]
*  which has been around Washington forever. They're a hardcore neocon pro-Israel, pro-war group. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1237.0s)]
*  And the article that was planted, I think, in the New York Post about Steve Witkoff [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1244.04s)]
*  said, included this quote, the last time Trump had a chance to meet directly with the Iranian [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  government, Bolton pushed back hard. Mark Dubowicz, head of the Foundation for the Defense of [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1254.6s)]
*  Democracy, said, I think it was a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1261.6399999999999s)]
*  very difficult deal. And so Bolton, who is the head of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1269.08s)]
*  and a highly influential figure during Trump's first term, is hoping that the [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1277.72s)]
*  quote, the new generation of hawks in the administration could try to block a deal [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1282.84s)]
*  internally by framing it as humiliating and embarrassing to Trump personally. So that's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1286.84s)]
*  It's basically you're going to be humiliated trying to play on Trump's insecurities. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1292.2s)]
*  Like you're going to look weak. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1296.52s)]
*  It then goes on, quote, anybody engaging in these kinds of talks with Putin, meaning Witkoff, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1300.16s)]
*  would benefit from having experienced Russia, Russia hands on his or her team and meeting [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1304.88s)]
*  with them and bringing them along to the Kremlin. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1309.68s)]
*  John Hardy, director of the Foundation of Defense of Democracy's Russia program, said [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1312.44s)]
*  of Witkoff's move, meaning going to meet Putin and trying to end the war. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1315.96s)]
*  So there's this massive attack on Witkoff. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1319.68s)]
*  And about that, Charlie Kirk said just two days ago, quote, the foundation for the defense [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1323.6000000000001s)]
*  of democracy's is leading the anti-Witkoff operation. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1327.88s)]
*  They are openly calling for people in the administration to undermine President Trump [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1331.28s)]
*  to stop a deal with Iran. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1335.44s)]
*  The anti-Witkoff forces are anti-MAGA. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1336.8s)]
*  And then Donald Trump Jr., a major voice in the Trump administration, retweeted that Charlie [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1341.6000000000001s)]
*  Kirk tweet and said, quote, deep state neocons are smearing Steve Witkoff because they're [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1346.66s)]
*  trying to understand, to undermine my father's foreign policy agenda. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1350.98s)]
*  The establishment wants forever war. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1355.14s)]
*  And it's hard to dispute any of that. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1360.1000000000001s)]
*  That's clearly what is happening. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1362.9s)]
*  You had three close allies and friends of Pete Hegsass at the top of the Pentagon, all [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1365.3000000000002s)]
*  of whom had this isolationist, anti-interventionist, avoiding war in the Middle East perspective, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1372.1s)]
*  led by Dan Caldwell, who we talked about last week, all of whom got fired based on fabricated [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1378.26s)]
*  accusations that they were leakers. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1382.4199999999998s)]
*  They manipulated and cajoled Hegsass to get rid of these people who were trying to stop [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1384.1s)]
*  a war with Iran as well. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1388.34s)]
*  And then you see all these attacks on Hegsass and Tucker Carlson and Steve Witkoff, JD Vance, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1393.1399999999999s)]
*  the people leading this effort. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1400.14s)]
*  The wing that has dragged the US into war and wants to drag the US into more Middle [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1403.9s)]
*  East wars remains extremely potent, notwithstanding Trump's resistance to them. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWOH2EHfSoQ&t=1407.0200000000002s)]
