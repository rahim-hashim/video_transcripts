# Is There Anyone Who Opposes All Luigi-Style Vigilantism?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM)
*  There's been a lot of discourse, a lot of discussion, a lot of think pieces, a lot of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=0.0s)]
*  debate about the killing of the CEO of Universal Health Care, which is the largest health insurance [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=12.0s)]
*  company in the country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=21.68s)]
*  And we cover that ourselves in the context of examining why people hate the health insurance [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=23.44s)]
*  industry, not just people on the left, people across the political spectrum. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=27.84s)]
*  I talked about what we confronted personally from a health insurance company in Brazil [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=31.68s)]
*  that was owned by Universal Health Care that operates very similarly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=37.76s)]
*  The way they deny coverage to you at your most difficult time after you pay premiums [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=40.16s)]
*  forever, they'll concoct ways to deny you the opportunity to visit doctors. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=43.56s)]
*  It's an industry that people despise. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=48.16s)]
*  And so the fact that someone clearly targeted the CEO produced all over the political spectrum [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=51.48s)]
*  a lot of, I wouldn't say celebration of the fact that the CEO himself died, but a lot [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=59.4s)]
*  of unleashed rage at this industry that impeded people from being particularly empathetic [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=64.12s)]
*  with the victim and in some cases quite supportive of the killer whose identity at the time we [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=69.72s)]
*  did this segment was not known. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=75.84s)]
*  Since then, as you've undoubtedly heard, the police apprehended someone that they claim [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=79.0s)]
*  is the suspect or the killer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=84.0s)]
*  He is the suspect. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=86.36s)]
*  They claim he's the killer. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=87.36s)]
*  His name is Luigi Maggioni, who is 26 years old. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=88.36s)]
*  And his lawyer says he intends to plead guilty, says he hasn't seen any forensic evidence [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=94.0s)]
*  linking him to the crime. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=98.52s)]
*  So we don't know if he is the killer in fact, but the manifesto that he had with him was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=100.36s)]
*  leaked and the independent journalist Clint Klippenstein obtained a copy of it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=110.64s)]
*  It was very much exactly what one might expect, namely that I did this because I hate the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  health insurance industry. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  There was a document, an online trail, a long online trail written by Luigi Maggioni including [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=122.04s)]
*  having commented on or reviewed the Unabomber's manifesto where the Unabomber justified why [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=130.84s)]
*  he sent mail bombs to people, killed innocent people. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=136.46s)]
*  And the manifesto was actually one of the most interesting things you could ever read. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=143.72s)]
*  It was very prescient, warning about the dangers of advancing technology and atomization of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=147.16s)]
*  society. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=151.0s)]
*  And in that review he said while he was justly imprisoned because he ended up killing innocent [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=153.36s)]
*  people, violence is often justified when there's no other way to get attention for a cause. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=159.08s)]
*  That's what his view was. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=167.2s)]
*  So a lot of people, turns out Luigi Maggioni is extremely attractive, physically attractive, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=168.28s)]
*  and that has absolutely shaped the way people are reacting to the story. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=175.72s)]
*  Human attractiveness, human beauty is a very powerful force and that unquestionably is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=179.76s)]
*  generating a lot more sympathy for him, a lot more interest in him, a lot more support [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=185.72s)]
*  for him. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=190.28s)]
*  There's more and more photos that are being uncovered and it's absolutely true. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=191.28s)]
*  There's no denying that he's a very good looking person and there's been a history in the United [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=194.84s)]
*  States before of when defendants are young or looking. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=198.12s)]
*  There's a lot of empathy and support for that person including romantic or sexual attraction. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=202.74s)]
*  It happened with Ted Bundy, the serial killer. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=207.8s)]
*  It happened with Charles Manson and it's definitely happening in this case. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  And there was already a lot of support before anyone saw pictures of the suspect who we [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=215.12s)]
*  still don't know is the killer but that's what the police insist on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=219.8s)]
*  And then once he became known, once his pictures became known, once more was known about him, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  support for him has increased. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=229.0s)]
*  And so there's a lot of anger around the fact in some circles that people seem supportive [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=230.0s)]
*  of the idea that vigilante justice in pursuit of a cause can be justified in. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=236.16s)]
*  There's a lot of people who are insisting as a matter of principle, vigilante justice [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=240.68s)]
*  can never be justified. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=245.16s)]
*  It's never justified to use violence to murder someone in pursuit of a cause in an extraditional [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=246.36s)]
*  way. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=251.32s)]
*  Here just as one example, here's the New York Post from December 11th. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=254.0s)]
*  GOOLS launched legal defense fund for United Healthcare CEO, slaying suspect Luigi Mangione. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=257.76s)]
*  So they're calling people GOOLS who created a legal defense fund for him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=265.0s)]
*  Here is Jesse Waters, the Fox News host who show on quite frequently who ranted and raved [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=269.2s)]
*  with a lot of anger and rage. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=275.72s)]
*  This is before or right when they say they caught the killer at the McDonald's and here's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=277.56s)]
*  what he had to say about people he perceives to be cheering for the killer. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=282.82s)]
*  And good, he's got it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=288.6s)]
*  Now he's a prep school kid. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=290.24s)]
*  He's politically connected. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=291.76s)]
*  Do you think he's ready for prison? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=292.76s)]
*  I don't think anyone's ready, Brian. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=294.0s)]
*  Maybe you are, Brian, in a different way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=296.12s)]
*  But this guy's not ready. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=297.88s)]
*  He's way too soft. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=299.4s)]
*  He's going to get annihilated on the inside. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  And good, if he's not going to get the death penalty, maybe someone will do him justice [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  behind bars. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=305.88s)]
*  That's all I have to say about that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=307.52s)]
*  You should stop there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=308.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=310.44s)]
*  Now, there's a gigantic irony there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=311.44s)]
*  That on the one hand, you're saying that vigilante justice and murdering people extrajudicially [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=315.24s)]
*  can never be justified. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=321.04s)]
*  And people who support it or cheer it or encourage it are ghouls and monsters. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=324.0s)]
*  And then on the other hand, in the same segment, turning around and saying there's a good chance [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=331.36s)]
*  he's going to get raped or murdered in prison and I hope he does. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=337.28s)]
*  He deserves it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=340.72s)]
*  Obviously, if somebody's murdered in prison by a fellow prisoner, that is the very definition [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=341.96s)]
*  of extrajudicial murder, of vigilante justice. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=347.62s)]
*  So I've seen this happen quite a bit where people claim that they're opposed to vigilante [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  justice or people murdering for a cause on the one hand, but then turning around and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  cheering it when their politics makes them more supportive of it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=359.3s)]
*  And it really makes me question whether people actually oppose this sort of violence for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=362.94s)]
*  a cause, the killing of somebody extrajudicially, who they think deserves to be murdered for [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=366.8s)]
*  their political acts or their acts that harm society, or whether people actually believe [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  in it, anybody, as a principle. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=376.1s)]
*  Just to give you one more example. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  Here's Michael Moynihan of the Free Press. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=380.94s)]
*  Here is what he had to say on some Free Press podcast talking about what he says are people [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=383.34s)]
*  on the left cheering for this murder. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  This kid was a spoiled rich brat who went to a $40,000 a year private school. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=393.26s)]
*  His family, wealthy for generations. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  The guy that he murdered's father was a grain elevator operator and he went to the University [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=401.82s)]
*  of Ohio, a public school. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=406.12s)]
*  So we want to put that kind of, this kid is a privileged little rat and he deserves to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=407.74s)]
*  rot in hell and rot in prison and then rot in hell. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=413.3s)]
*  The person who... [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=416.34000000000003s)]
*  All right, so I think we have one more. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  This is... [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=420.7s)]
*  Okay, so that's been the discourse that either he's kind of heroic or at least he acted in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=421.7s)]
*  a way that's good for society by not just necessarily killing this one CEO, but kind [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=430.86s)]
*  of signaling to the country that people are so angry about what's being done to them by [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=435.74s)]
*  large faceless corporations. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=441.42s)]
*  Not just the health insurance industry, but large corporations in general, the way they [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=444.18s)]
*  exploit people, don't look at them as humanity, don't care about their lives, are willing [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=448.14s)]
*  to destroy their lives just to add some profit to the bottom line. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  And that this killing is beneficial because it forced a examination of why so many people [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=456.8s)]
*  have health insurance industry. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=462.1s)]
*  You have that kind of view on the one side and then on the other side you have this sanctimonious [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=463.66s)]
*  on the moral high horse lecture that it is grotesque and immoral in every case to murder [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=469.18s)]
*  somebody for a political hazard to engage in vigilante justice. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=477.90000000000003s)]
*  Here's the aforementioned manifesto that the police claim they found on Luigi Mangione [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=482.74s)]
*  when they arrested him. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=488.38s)]
*  And it was a pretty short manifesto, all things being considered, these are usually longer, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=490.9s)]
*  and it was leaked to the journalist who I think is a reliable journalist, Ken Klippenstein, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  I worked with him at the Intercept. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=500.73999999999995s)]
*  And here's part of what the manifesto said, quote, a reminder, the US has the number one [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=502.7s)]
*  most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly 42 in life expectancy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=507.7s)]
*  United Healthcare is the largest company in the US by market cap behind only Apple, Google, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=514.26s)]
*  and Walmart. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=519.26s)]
*  We've grown and grown, but has our life expectancy? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=520.74s)]
*  No. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=523.74s)]
*  The reality is these, and it's indecipherable, it could be these pigs, these cretins, these [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=524.74s)]
*  companies have simply gotten too powerful and they continue to abuse our country for [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=529.46s)]
*  immense profit because the American public has allowed them to get away with it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=534.06s)]
*  It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=538.46s)]
*  Evidently, I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=542.8199999999999s)]
*  And there's another part that says these vermin had it coming, things of that nature. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  So at least if you believe that this is the killer and you believe that this is his manifesto, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=552.0999999999999s)]
*  he was acting in an ideological cause out of anger and rage that maybe it didn't even [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=557.76s)]
*  affect him negatively. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  There was a report today that he had never been a universal healthcare insurance carrier. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=565.9s)]
*  He was never insured by universal healthcare. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=572.68s)]
*  He does come from a wealthy family. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=575.3000000000001s)]
*  There's reports he had medical problems with his back. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  Some say that surgery was successful. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=581.54s)]
*  Others say he suffered a lot from his back. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=583.0s)]
*  But sometimes people just act in a cause that isn't necessarily directly about them. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=584.52s)]
*  Some people can actually be angry at injustices towards others, genuinely angry about it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=590.12s)]
*  You've had wealthy people before become socialists or even communists, even though doing so requires [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=595.84s)]
*  them to give up their wealth. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=602.96s)]
*  FDR, for example, was someone from a very wealthy and aristocratic family and yet was [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  responsible for the New Deal, probably the single largest socialist program in the United [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=611.36s)]
*  States that changed the course of how American capitalism functions, even though FDR didn't [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=616.6s)]
*  need Social Security or any of the other social net benefits that he ushered in. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=622.64s)]
*  Same with Lyndon Johnson. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  So the fact that somebody themselves is not directly injured by an injustice or victimized [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=630.04s)]
*  by it doesn't preclude their authentic rage at that injustice. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=634.12s)]
*  Lots of people become enraged at injustices that don't affect them but affect others. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=637.48s)]
*  That's just called basic human empathy. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=641.36s)]
*  But what I really seriously doubt, and I've talked about these sorts of things before [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=644.86s)]
*  when people claim that they believe in a certain principle, yet in reality seem to only really [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=650.64s)]
*  find it objectionable in this particular case. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=656.48s)]
*  I remember, for example, we covered on the show, there was an American about four months [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=659.28s)]
*  ago, five months ago, who set himself on fire, engaged in self-immolation and died as a symbolic [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=664.28s)]
*  act of protest in front of the White House to the Biden support for the Israeli destruction [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=670.48s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=674.04s)]
*  And a lot of people on the left who believe that's a genocide, who believe it's a crime [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=675.76s)]
*  against humanity, said this is a noble act, a protest. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=679.04s)]
*  It's an effective noble just cause of protest. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=683.74s)]
*  And I saw a lot of people on the right saying, and in the media as well, saying it's despicable [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=686.64s)]
*  to praise self-immolation and suicide as a form of political protest. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=692.6s)]
*  And one of the things we did on that show where we talked about that was we looked at [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=697.72s)]
*  other instances where not Americans engaged in self-immolation and protest of U.S. government [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=700.58s)]
*  policy but where people in China did or people in the Arab world did against governments [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=705.96s)]
*  And they were widely venerated as heroic for their act of self-immolation. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=712.24s)]
*  So it wasn't that these people so angry about the praise for that protester hate self-immolation [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=720.04s)]
*  as a principle like they were claiming, they just hated it in this case because they support [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=726.28s)]
*  the Israeli war in Gaza and this person was against it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=730.12s)]
*  I think it's very important to examine whether people who are claiming that they believe [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=733.52s)]
*  in a principle that they apply in all cases are in fact only claiming it for this one [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=737.92s)]
*  particular case. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=741.8s)]
*  I am quite certain, positive, that people like the New York Post, Michael Moynihan, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=744.52s)]
*  Jesse Waters, the vast majority of people on the right and in the media, it's not just [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  people on the right. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=756.12s)]
*  Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, the senator from Pennsylvania, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=757.12s)]
*  most Democrats in Washington, most media outlets in Washington have said, this is despicable. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=761.24s)]
*  You can't support in any way a cold-blooded murder like this. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=765.92s)]
*  I have no doubt we can imagine those exact kind of people supporting it, cheering it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=771.0s)]
*  If someone went and murdered tomorrow as an assassination, Vladimir Putin or Nicholas [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  Maduro or the Iranian Ayatollah, I have no doubt that a lot of people would not be saying [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=785.4599999999999s)]
*  vigilante justice is never appropriate. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=791.8399999999999s)]
*  You can't murder people extraditionally because of a perception that they're engaging in [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=793.76s)]
*  some sort of political harm or harm to the society that can never be justified. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=798.28s)]
*  I have no doubt that people would be cheering that. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=801.52s)]
*  Every time somebody on the left dies, a hated figure on the left and the right celebrates, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=804.96s)]
*  the left says, it's despicable to celebrate someone's death. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=810.04s)]
*  That's a human being, a father, a son, a grandfather, whatever, a husband. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=813.46s)]
*  And then every time somebody on the right dies and the left celebrates, the right turns [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=820.28s)]
*  around and says the same thing. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=826.6s)]
*  Of course, there are people who we think are doing so much harm to society that it's justified [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=829.0s)]
*  to cheer when they die and even when someone goes and kills them in the name of stopping [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=835.04s)]
*  the harm that they're doing to society. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=840.02s)]
*  If after O.J. Simpson's acquittal, someone from Nicole Brown Simpson's family or Ron [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=844.88s)]
*  Goldman's family had gone and killed O.J. Simpson out of rage that he murdered their [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=850.4s)]
*  loved one and then got away with it, would people really be saying, this is outrageous? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=856.68s)]
*  I am so empathetic and sad for O.J. Simpson and his family. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=862.48s)]
*  I'm disgusted by the people who say he had it coming, that they understand why people [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=867.28s)]
*  and the victim's families would go and do that. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=872.98s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=874.4200000000001s)]
*  There'd be a lot of people saying, I absolutely understand that, including people who are [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=875.4200000000001s)]
*  now saying vigilante justice, extraditional murder is never justified. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=879.14s)]
*  You can think of all sorts of examples. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=886.34s)]
*  There's all these times when some defendant is on trial for pedophilia or molestation [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=888.02s)]
*  of a child and in court the father or some male relative of the child, out of rage, attacks [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=893.62s)]
*  him and beats him, breaks his nose, and everybody stands up and applauds that, even though that's [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=900.58s)]
*  the definition of vigilante justice, even though that is by definition trying to harm [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=905.38s)]
*  somebody outside of the court system, try to kill them for acts that they did that are [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=910.66s)]
*  bad. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=915.42s)]
*  All the time people who get killed in prison, if Harvey Weinstein got murdered in prison [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=916.58s)]
*  or some other notorious criminal got murdered in prison, or as we saw with Jesse Waters, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=923.1s)]
*  if Luigi Mangione or if he's convicted ends up going to prison and gets murdered, there [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=929.54s)]
*  are a lot of people cheering that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=933.74s)]
*  Not because he had due process and was given the death penalty, but because someone looked [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=936.5s)]
*  at this person and said, I think that person is so evil, has done so much harm to society, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=939.9399999999999s)]
*  that it's justified to engage in violence against them. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=945.74s)]
*  That's exactly what happened in the case of Luigi Mangione, but there are a lot of people [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=947.86s)]
*  who see health insurance executives as benign and not malignant, and they're reacting to [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=952.74s)]
*  that. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=957.54s)]
*  Nobody deserves this, but that this person in particular didn't deserve it or the political [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=959.18s)]
*  cause in which it was done is not actually a justifiable one. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=962.9s)]
*  It's not a principle at all. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=966.26s)]
*  There was actually a case, and I don't want to go too deeply into it, because some people [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=968.14s)]
*  are trying to compare it to Daniel Nely's chokehold on, Daniel Penny's chokehold on [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=973.66s)]
*  the New York subway, which he just got acquitted for. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=984.9s)]
*  But in 1984, there was a case that was a lot more extreme of vigilante justice that divided [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=986.9s)]
*  New York City and generated a lot of support. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=996.38s)]
*  It was the case, a lot of you probably don't remember because of age. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=999.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't remember it either. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1002.58s)]
*  I just read about it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1003.7s)]
*  I'm much too young to have remembered this or have lived through it. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1004.7s)]
*  It was 1984 in New York City. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1006.94s)]
*  A person named Bernie Getz was on the subway, and four black teenagers got on the subway, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1009.1800000000001s)]
*  and one of them walked over to him and said, can you give me $5? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1014.94s)]
*  I want $5. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1019.98s)]
*  And then one of his other friends came over and said, yeah, give me $5 too. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1021.66s)]
*  And Bernie Getz pulled out a gun and shot all four of them. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1025.74s)]
*  And when one of them was laying on the ground scared and petrified because he had been shot, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1029.78s)]
*  Bernie Getz said, oh, you don't look that bad. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1034.94s)]
*  Let me give you another one and shot him a second time. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1036.9s)]
*  And that second bullet went into his spine, caused him to be paralyzed in the waist down [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1040.26s)]
*  for life and to have severe brain damage. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1045.98s)]
*  He has the mental capacity of an eight-year-old because of that second shot after the guy [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1049.02s)]
*  was already on the ground. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1052.9s)]
*  And for a lot of people, Bernie Getz became a hero, a vigilante hero. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1055.38s)]
*  Oh, thank God somebody finally gave these thugs on the subway what they deserved. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1058.38s)]
*  There's all kinds of evidence that Bernie Gates had made all sorts of racist statements, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1062.7800000000002s)]
*  that he was racist, but he became a hero. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1066.42s)]
*  He was like an outpouring of, yeah, these people deserve it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1068.94s)]
*  Maybe these four guys weren't that bad. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1073.46s)]
*  Maybe they weren't going to murder anyone. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1075.74s)]
*  They were just panhandling. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1076.78s)]
*  But in general, this whole group of people, thugs who get on the subway and menace people [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1077.98s)]
*  on the subway, it's time they get scared. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1083.94s)]
*  It's time they got something back that got what was coming to them. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1087.9s)]
*  And there were a lot of people who said vigilante justice is not justifiable. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1094.4199999999998s)]
*  There was no reason for him to kill anybody. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1099.46s)]
*  He wasn't being threatened. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1101.1399999999999s)]
*  He wasn't being menaced. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1102.1399999999999s)]
*  He wasn't in danger. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  And they indicted Bernie Getz, and the jury acquitted him on most of the serious charges. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1106.8999999999999s)]
*  He was convicted on a gun crime and spent about eight months in prison. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1117.26s)]
*  And then his worst victim, the victim who suffered the worst injury, the one who was [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1121.02s)]
*  already on the ground shot, he said, you don't look that bad. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1125.18s)]
*  Let me give you another one and shot him again. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1127.1399999999999s)]
*  And he ended up paralyzed and with brain damage, sued him and got something like a $40 million [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1129.22s)]
*  judgment. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1133.46s)]
*  Never recovered any money. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1134.46s)]
*  But nonetheless, the jury found that the shooting was wrongful. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1136.46s)]
*  And there were huge numbers of people who supported Bernie Getz, not even because, again, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1140.86s)]
*  this particular person deserved it, it's because the cause of saying enough is enough. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1144.62s)]
*  And as a message to other people who do seriously threaten or even attack people on the subway, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1151.54s)]
*  it was time for them to finally understand that they have something coming to them too. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1155.7s)]
*  That sounds to me a lot like the rationale, a lot like, in fact, almost identical to the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1159.62s)]
*  rationale of those supporting the murder of this CEO, which is this health insurance industry [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1165.46s)]
*  has destroyed so many people's lives. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1170.0s)]
*  It's killed people by denying coverage. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1171.8999999999999s)]
*  It's put entire families into bankruptcy at their most vulnerable moment that this industry [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1173.86s)]
*  finally deserves what's coming to them. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1179.46s)]
*  This CEO may not have been the worst. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1181.46s)]
*  He might have been. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1183.18s)]
*  It's not that we're happy that that particular person got shot or dead, so this thing can [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1185.7800000000002s)]
*  go. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1188.74s)]
*  It's that someone needed to finally take this cause that people have been ignoring and bring [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1189.74s)]
*  in attention through violence, kind of similar to the Ted Kaczynski rationale about why he [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1194.5400000000002s)]
*  engaged in violence to force people to pay attention to what he said they were ignoring [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1199.7s)]
*  that he ended up writing a manifesto about and got it published in the Washington Post [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1203.9s)]
*  and the New York Times by negotiating with them. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1207.7s)]
*  So I don't think this issue is as clear cut as it appears to be, or at least in terms [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1210.94s)]
*  of how people are insisting that it is. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1217.18s)]
*  And I do think a lot of times discourse becomes very reactionary, where people are in fact [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1220.18s)]
*  reacting to their opposition to the political cause or the ideology involved, and they're [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1224.66s)]
*  pretending that they have some universal moral principle and they get so much up on their [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1229.9s)]
*  high horse that I'm certain you could find in their past and easily imagine hypotheticals [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1234.7s)]
*  in the future where they would be the ones cheering vigilante justice in violence and [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1240.3400000000001s)]
*  murder based on the exact rationale that is at play here. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqWGvKOoJM&t=1244.74s)]
