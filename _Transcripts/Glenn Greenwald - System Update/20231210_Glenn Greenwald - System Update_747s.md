# INTERVIEW: Lee Fang Exposes Secret Israeli Propaganda Op
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E)
*  Friend of the show and intrepid investigative journalist Lee Fong has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=0.0s)]
*  gotten his hands on some truly fascinating documents, documents that had [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=10.76s)]
*  been intended to be secret and that were secret until he and his co-author [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Patrick Olson were able to obtain them and then write about them. They are [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=20.64s)]
*  documents and WhatsApp chats that show, let's put the article on the screen, it's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  on Lee's sub stack which if you're not following and subscribing to I really [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=30.46s)]
*  hope you will as some of the most important independent journalism, original [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=33.82s)]
*  reporting journalism and there you see it inside the pro-Israel information [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=37.5s)]
*  war, Israeli government led zoom calls, WhatsApp chat logs and other documents [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=41.66s)]
*  provide a window into the massive effort to shape online discourse and silence [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=46.18s)]
*  pro-Palestinian voices. We have Lee tonight to talk about his reporting. Lee [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=50.82s)]
*  it's great to see you as always thank you for coming on the show tonight. Thank [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  you so much for having me. Yeah so let's, let me just ask you to start with for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=59.66s)]
*  those who haven't read the article and I really encourage everybody to go read [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=63.82s)]
*  this. What for you are the key findings? What is it that we learned from these [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=66.38s)]
*  documents you were able to obtain? Well this is a very broad look at the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=73.06s)]
*  organizing behind the pro-Israel kind of side here in the US. I reported this over [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=80.38s)]
*  the last few weeks with my colleague Jack Polson. He's the founder of Tech [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=87.62s)]
*  Inquiry. He's really a fantastic reporter who covers the tech industry and defense [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=91.98s)]
*  industry and we took a look at one organization the J Ventures Global [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=97.62s)]
*  Kibbutz. This is an investment fund, a US Israeli investment fund. They formed a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=105.06s)]
*  WhatsApp to support Israel in this war and it is composed of over 300 members [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=110.5s)]
*  many very prominent tech executives, venture capitalists and other investors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=116.74s)]
*  You know they engaged in a number of activities. Some of them are very benign [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  and perhaps even laudatory, raising funds for medical supplies, helping with [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=128.26s)]
*  Israeli hospitals and you know other humanitarian goods for communities [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=134.98s)]
*  affected by this conflict. But this piece kind of looks also at the advocacy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=142.18s)]
*  and lobbying. It's through this WhatsApp channel and perhaps many other channels [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=148.02s)]
*  that pro-Israel forces have organized to cancel pro-Palestinian speakers to shut [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  down events to support universities in canceling and revoking the status for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=160.78s)]
*  pro-Palestinian activist groups from students including the the decision by [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=166.74s)]
*  Colombia to revoke the status for two pro-Palestinian groups. In addition it [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=171.62s)]
*  looks at how there's a role of Israeli government officials. Of course any group [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=179.06s)]
*  in the US has the right to speak up on a major public policy that there's no [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=185.54s)]
*  controversy there. What's unusual here is that we have many examples of Israeli [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=191.06s)]
*  government officials, folks from the IDF or from the Israeli Foreign Affairs [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=196.06s)]
*  Ministry sitting in on these WhatsApp meetings providing guidance, providing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  talking points, guiding the advocacy, kind of suggesting strategy for social media, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=204.78s)]
*  suggesting strategy for engaging opponents and really encouraging tech [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  elites and Silicon Valley elites to use their influence with universities, with [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  lawmakers and others to support Congress providing military support to Israel to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=219.62s)]
*  kind of shape the conversation, the discourse, the media discourse to support [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=226.86s)]
*  the pro-Israel narrative. One of the things you say in the article is that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=231.5s)]
*  part of the goal of this effort is to shape online discourse and also to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=235.38000000000002s)]
*  silence pro-Palestinian voices. What are some of the examples you have of how [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  they tried to silence pro-Palestinian voices? Well in mid-October, this is just [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=244.22000000000003s)]
*  one example, there was an employee of Wix, it's a website building company [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=251.66s)]
*  with a big base in Israel. This was an employee in Ireland who tweeted, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=259.06s)]
*  free Palestine. That was it, no like from the river to the sea, no intifada, global [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=265.3s)]
*  intifada, just free Palestine. Initially that was the tweet, she later, or the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=273.34s)]
*  LinkedIn message, this was on, I apologize, she posted on LinkedIn, the initial [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=279.14s)]
*  message was just free Palestine, later she elaborated that she opposes an [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=283.62s)]
*  exclusive Zionist project that does not give equal rights to Palestinians, that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=289.02s)]
*  type of message. But initially what was captured and shared with this 300 person [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=293.86s)]
*  WhatsApp group was just the free Palestine message and members of the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=298.46s)]
*  group immediately said we need to take action on this, it's already [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=304.34s)]
*  been referred to a high level executive at Wix and that high level executive said [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=307.38s)]
*  it's been taken care of, we'll be announcing something later today and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=312.5s)]
*  indeed the next day it was announced that this employee was fired. In addition [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=316.98s)]
*  there are many examples in this piece, Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=323.06s)]
*  American in Congress was slated to appear for a pro-Palestinian lecture at [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=327.3s)]
*  the Arizona State University, this was brought to the attention of the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=333.38000000000005s)]
*  group, many members collaborated in sending messages to the university [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  campus president, to even the mayor's office on Scottsdale, applying pressure [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=343.54s)]
*  in other ways and indeed that event was cancelled. Muhammad El-Kurd, a writer [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=349.54s)]
*  from the nation from East Jerusalem, he was slated to appear at the University [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=355.54s)]
*  of Vermont for a lecture, again there was an organizing effort started by tech [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=360.54s)]
*  executives on this WhatsApp group to apply pressure and indeed that event was [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=366.86s)]
*  also cancelled. I want to say I don't know if this was the determining factor [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=370.62s)]
*  but it appeared to have some influence over these university decisions, they [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=374.70000000000005s)]
*  were kind of bland or kind of confusing reasons that were publicly given around [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=379.58000000000004s)]
*  public safety or procedural reason for why these events were cancelled, it [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=383.66s)]
*  didn't really make sense but we're seeing free speech being snuffed out [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=387.42s)]
*  around this country around this issue, many journalists, academics and others [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=391.74s)]
*  have lost their job for expressing controversial speech or speech that's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=397.1s)]
*  perceived as pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel. Yes and the censorship and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=401.98s)]
*  the punishment and the cancellation have all almost entirely been in one [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=406.94s)]
*  direction, all pro-Palestinian voices or critics of the Israeli government, those [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=410.94s)]
*  are the ones who have been fired or have been de-platformed or who otherwise [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=416.7s)]
*  been punished or taken out of schools or banned from accessing student groups [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=420.06s)]
*  whereas almost no there's about what maybe one or two cases pro-Israel [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=425.18s)]
*  activists and advocates who were deemed to have gone too far and had some issues [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=431.18s)]
*  with their job but the lopsidedness is so so so drastic and this is Lee one of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=435.5s)]
*  the things that is been agitating me and that I think your reporting shed so [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=442.74s)]
*  much light on which is whenever there's an attempt to censor political speech in [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=447.26s)]
*  the United States and in this case is being done to protect a foreign country [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=451.98s)]
*  you need some kind of a crisis that goes along with it, you need some reason why [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  people are endangered and why this speech is is so menacing that it has to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  be stopped and the narrative that has been created is a kind of victimhood [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=465.82s)]
*  narrative that the American right has spent years in this country heaping [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=469.68s)]
*  scorn on when it was for black people or Latinos or immigrants or Muslims or [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=474.24s)]
*  trans people or LGBTs, oh you poor little babies you don't feel safe on college [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=479.64s)]
*  campuses, do you need a security blanket and now suddenly because it's American [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=484.24s)]
*  Jews, oh American Jewish students at Harvard and Yale and MIT these are the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=488.6s)]
*  most endangered people on the planet and the irony of it is that you have in [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=493.4s)]
*  reality almost every major power center obviously the US Congress and all kinds [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  of industrial leaders and hedge fund billionaires like Bill Ackman who are [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  completely working as is their right but they're unified and very powerful [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=509.48s)]
*  working to punish people who are critical of Israel, who are the kinds of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=513.64s)]
*  people who are in this group like how powerful are they, are they influential, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=518.4s)]
*  who are these people working to control and shape discourse in the United States [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=522.2s)]
*  and punish people who are critics of Israel or pro-Palestinian? Well one [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=528.12s)]
*  example is Bessemer Venture Partners, it's one of the largest venture capital [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=534.12s)]
*  firms in Silicon Valley, a big investment firm behind some of the leading lights [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=539.64s)]
*  in tech, multiple billions of dollars under management, they have several of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=544.44s)]
*  their partners in this orbit, in fact the head of the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=549.88s)]
*  Israel office for Bessemer led a webinar last month alongside a spokesperson [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=557.12s)]
*  with the IDF in uniform for tech leaders to engage in social media war, really [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=566.32s)]
*  explaining that the only way for the IDF to have space on the battlefield is to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=572.72s)]
*  win on the media and social media battlefield, that you should ridicule [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=578.0400000000001s)]
*  opponents that you know kind of listing out different talking points to engage [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=584.36s)]
*  here and again any activist group, any special interest has a right to speak [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=590.0400000000001s)]
*  out to engage on social media, which what's interesting is the level of power [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=597.0s)]
*  here, many powerful tech leaders and also the fact that they're doing this [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=600.88s)]
*  alongside a foreign military, that is unusual, that looking at this broadly [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=605.36s)]
*  we've had also several social media seminars from the Israeli [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=614.28s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Ministry similarly telling American audience members how to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=621.8s)]
*  engage when commenting on university campus news articles, that when you [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=628.76s)]
*  go into the comment section here are different arguments you can make, here's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=634.8s)]
*  how you should tag the university president to get them involved in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=638.12s)]
*  dispute, clearly kind of bringing in the issues around safety and security and [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=641.08s)]
*  that's been made explicit in this 300 member WhatsApp group, the issues that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=648.08s)]
*  you reference around what's been called wokeness that historically [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=652.88s)]
*  disadvantaged or oppressed identity groups, whether that's sexual [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=658.2800000000001s)]
*  orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, that because of those histories that we [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0glDPJZ7E&t=663.44s)]
