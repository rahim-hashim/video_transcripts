# Fact-Checkers MELT DOWN After Zuckerberg's Free Speech Announcement
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0)
*  Now, I think the most important part of this story is the missile, the blow that it strikes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=0.0s)]
*  toward the disinformation industry. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=13.4s)]
*  There's been a lot of reporting about the disinformation industry and industry is really [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=14.96s)]
*  what it has become. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=19.56s)]
*  It's a censorship industrialized complex. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=20.56s)]
*  Back in 2021, Harper's Magazine by Joe Bernstein wrote one of the best stories on how this [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=23.72s)]
*  industry emerged. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=29.52s)]
*  It was entitled Bad News Selling the Story of Disinformation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=30.52s)]
*  And here's just a small part of what it said, quote, big disinformation, big disinfo has [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=35.64s)]
*  found the energetic support from the highest echelons of the American political center, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  which has been warning of an existential content crisis more or less constantly since the 2016 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=46.64s)]
*  election. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  To take only the most recent example, in May, Hillary Clinton told the former Tory leader [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Lord Hague that quote, there must be a reckoning by the tech companies for the role that they [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=57.16s)]
*  play in undermining the information ecosystem that is absolutely essential for the functioning [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=62.08s)]
*  of any democracy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=67.24s)]
*  Some have surprisingly big tech agrees compared with other more literally toxic corporate [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=69.56s)]
*  giants. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=73.56s)]
*  Those in the tech industry have been rather quick to concede the role they play in corrupting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=74.88s)]
*  the allegedly pure stream of American reality. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=78.84s)]
*  Over five years ago, Mark Zuckerberg said it was quote, a pretty crazy idea that bad [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=81.24s)]
*  content on his website had persuaded enough voters to swing the 2016 election to Donald [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=86.48s)]
*  Trump, quote, voters make decisions based on their lived experience, Zuckerberg said. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=96.68s)]
*  the way they did is because they saw fake news. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  A year later, suddenly chastened, he apologized for being glib and pledged to do his part [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  to thwart those who, quote, spread disinformation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=109.28s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=111.92s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg mocked the idea after the 2016 election that people only voted for Donald [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=114.08s)]
*  Trump because they were deceived by disinformation to do so. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=119.66s)]
*  A very patronizing and insulting way to talk about the vast majority of voters that they [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=122.48s)]
*  voted the way you didn't want only because they're too stupid and were deceived. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=127.6s)]
*  And that's what he essentially said. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=132.36s)]
*  He said that's a reductive and ridiculous way of looking at it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=133.36s)]
*  And minutes there was political pressure put on Facebook to institute anti-disinformation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=135.92s)]
*  policies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg immediately did that and Facebook became a vortex of political censorship. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=145.64s)]
*  Tablet Magazine and Jacob Siegel, who's a friend of the show, he's been on several times, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  also wrote a great article we had a month to talk about at the time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=157.0s)]
*  And we've gone through this history many times, a guide to understanding the hoax of the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=159.6s)]
*  13 ways of looking at disinformation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=164.24s)]
*  It traces the emergence of this disinformation industry funded in large part by the U.S. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=166.12s)]
*  government. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=171.84s)]
*  Quote, since 2016, the federal government has spent billions of dollars on turning the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=172.84s)]
*  counter disinformation complex into one of the world's most powerful forces in the modern [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=177.0s)]
*  world, a sprawling leviathan with tentacles reaching into both the public and private [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=182.08s)]
*  sector, which the government uses to direct a, quote, whole of society effort that aims [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=187.2s)]
*  to seize total control over the internet and achieve nothing less than the eradication [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=192.6s)]
*  of human error. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  So you can imagine why people who have acquired that power are so fearful and enraged of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  fact that they might have to give that up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=212.32s)]
*  Now let me just show you a little bit about what this industry actually is and how they're [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=216.8s)]
*  reacting today. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=226.52s)]
*  First of all, here from Business Insider, fact checkers at Metta call a, quote, emergency [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=227.52s)]
*  meeting after Mark Zuckerberg pulls the plug. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=238.08s)]
*  There's an emergency meeting because Metta will no longer fund and rely on the pronouncements [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=241.52s)]
*  of truth and falsity from these groups. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=249.28s)]
*  Quote, Metta's decision impacts the financial sustainability of fact checking organizations. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=251.12s)]
*  The International Fact Checking Network, the IFCN, you'd be forgiven if you didn't know [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=257.2s)]
*  there was such a thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=262.48s)]
*  Imagine proclaiming yourself to be a member of the International Fact Checking Network. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=264.68s)]
*  They convened today an emergency meeting, ooh, an emergency meeting, of its members [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=269.6s)]
*  following Metta's announcement on Tuesday that it will end its third party fact checking [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=275.14000000000004s)]
*  partnership in the US and replace them with a crowd source moderation tool similar to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=279.24s)]
*  X's community notes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  In an exclusive interview with Business Insider, IFCN director Angie Holan confirmed that the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=286.12s)]
*  meeting scheduled for Wednesday was organized in direct response to Metta's decision. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  We hold these meetings monthly, but we call this one specifically because of today's news, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=296.6s)]
*  she said. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=300.56s)]
*  How much would you pay to be able to watch the emergency meeting of these fact checkers [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=303.24s)]
*  who today were accused by Mark Zuckerberg, who used to be one of their biggest champions [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  of being fraudulent political actors, told they would no longer get this flow of money [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  and most importantly of all would lose the power to dictate on Metta's platforms what [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  can and can't be said. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  Imagine that to your whole purpose in life. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=322.76s)]
*  And out of nowhere, with no warning, this announcement comes, this attack on your purpose, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=325.23999999999995s)]
*  your whole life mission is announced by one of the most powerful people on the internet [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=330.44s)]
*  in technology. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=334.88s)]
*  I don't blame them for having an emergency meeting. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=335.88s)]
*  Like I said, the reports I got from inside these organizations, if you're a person with [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=340.44s)]
*  a lot of empathy for them, which I don't have, would make you kind of sad for them, but if [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  you don't have that empathy, if you think they're toxic influences and blights on a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  free discourse, as I do, you would find them extremely funny. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  I was actually concerned for myself today that I might have an overload of schadenfreude, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=358.24s)]
*  hearing about all these people and the way in which they're reacting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  Now if you wonder why this IFCN, this network of fact checkers, is so angry about and worried [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=366.32s)]
*  about the announcement that they were being cut off, it's because they get a lot of funding [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=374.56s)]
*  from Metta. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=377.68s)]
*  Here is their own fundraising page where they say, we would like to thank all of our funders, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=379.48s)]
*  all donations greater than 5,000 pounds received or listed here along with the amount they [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=387.48s)]
*  gave and what it was given for. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=393.56s)]
*  And then their biggest donors, their biggest donors are Google, where they got 285 million [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  euros. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=405.36s)]
*  They got, oh sorry, 285,000 from Google, they got 198,000 euros from Google and they got [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=407.36s)]
*  close to 300,000 from Facebook, their largest single donor and that was for third party [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=418.32s)]
*  fact checking and programming. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=425.16s)]
*  And now this is gone in one day, it's just gone. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not only gone in the sense that they're not getting that money anymore, it's gone [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  in the sense that this, their biggest source of revenue has said that they're basically [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=435.6s)]
*  a fraudulent service, that they're worthless and that it's better to rely on the community [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=441.96s)]
*  to assess truth than for them to do and obviously that's going to put pressure on their Google [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=447.76s)]
*  funding as well. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=453.2s)]
*  You may remember Nina Yankovitch, she was the ludicrous, preposterous cartoon of liberal [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=456.24s)]
*  that the Biden Homeland Security Department tried to install as the disinformation czar [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=462.36s)]
*  inside the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  Even for our censorship happy culture that was a bridge too far, the controversy was [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=473.56s)]
*  intense. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  Needless to say, she and her media allies, when she, the government had to force, was [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=478.32s)]
*  forced to reverse that decision, accused everybody of disinformation and then Nina Yankovitch [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  went and created her own disinformation project called the American Sunlight Project and she [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=490.88s)]
*  constantly refers to herself as a disinformation expert when she goes on CNN or when the New [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=498.76s)]
*  Year Times talks about her, she's referred to as a disinformation researcher. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=503.56s)]
*  She's a joke. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=508.0s)]
*  She's like, she's like if you were put in a room, dropped into a room of Rachel Maddow [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=510.32s)]
*  fans she would fit in perfectly. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=514.76s)]
*  She would not be remotely out of place. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=517.86s)]
*  That's who they wanted to make the disinformation czar when she didn't get to be that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=521.3000000000001s)]
*  She founded her own group that's now very well financed. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=523.86s)]
*  And talk about Schadenfreude, here was her announcement, Nina Yankovitch's statement [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=528.14s)]
*  in response to Meta eliminating fact checkers. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=533.14s)]
*  She put the statement on blue sky as well which is where she of course went. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMl4h9u3zb0&t=535.44s)]
