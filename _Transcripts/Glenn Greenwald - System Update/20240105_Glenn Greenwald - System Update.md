# Why the *Worst* Dem Hacks Just Endorsed Nikki Haley
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek)
*  It is election year 2024 and we anticipate for sure, we've talked about this a lot here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=0.0s)]
*  that this is going to be one of the most intense and unpredictable political years because [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=14.06s)]
*  we have the obviously unprecedented fact that the person leading the nomination primary [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=20.18s)]
*  race in the polls by 40 points and who is leading in all of the key swing states, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=27.66s)]
*  including the ones Joe Biden was declared the winner of in 2020. Donald Trump is also a person [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=33.9s)]
*  who is currently indicted in four separate jurisdictions. In other words, the Democratic [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=40.1s)]
*  Party is simultaneously running against Trump, most likely, and trying to put him in prison. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=46.34s)]
*  In four different cases, that already is a bizarre year at the same time you have, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=51.5s)]
*  the United States government trying to define the Trump movement as an insurrectionary movement, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=56.86s)]
*  as a criminal movement. And this is just the start. If Donald Trump remains politically strong, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=61.54s)]
*  what the Democrats and the corporate media, which is their allies in the US security state, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=69.58s)]
*  are willing to do in order to prevent Donald Trump from being re-elected president is literally [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=76.82s)]
*  unlimited. I don't believe they have any limits on what they're willing to do in order to prevent [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=84.02s)]
*  that from happening. And that's going to make an extremely unpredictable year. And as a sign of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=88.34s)]
*  just how desperate they're getting, we now have two of, I would say, the most blindly partisan [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=92.82s)]
*  Democrats in all of media, the MSNBC host Chris Hayes and Brian Butler, who used to work for Pod [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  Save America and used to be a writer at the New Republic and now has his own sub stack, who are [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=106.82s)]
*  now coming out and essentially saying that we think Nikki Haley by far is the best candidate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=112.98s)]
*  for the Republicans to nominate. And therefore they're urging Democratic Party voters in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=120.34s)]
*  crossover primaries, meaning where Democrats can vote in the Republican primary if they want, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=126.58s)]
*  vice versa, to go vote in the Republican primary because Biden doesn't need their vote. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=130.5s)]
*  The Democrats didn't allow a primary, even though there are primary opponents running against Biden, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=135.38s)]
*  there's no debates, the Democrats are just going to pretend that Biden is their nominee with no [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=140.34s)]
*  contest, no debate necessary, but the Republicans have a primary and so they're being told by [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=144.82000000000002s)]
*  the people most devoted to the Democratic Party and media that they should go and vote for Nikki [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=151.22000000000003s)]
*  Haley. Here is the tweet of Chris Hayes, the MSNBC host, his show All In with Chris Hayes, where he [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=155.3s)]
*  says, check out this piece by Brian Boy, or that Chris Hayes cited. So Chris Hayes on his show [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=162.82000000000002s)]
*  recommended this piece, talked about it, saying this is a possible strategy that liberals can use [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=167.77999999999997s)]
*  and here you see the article on the screen by Brian Butler that Chris Hayes recommended, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  liberals in open primary states should vote for Nikki Haley, yes, even after her rake stopping [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=179.05999999999997s)]
*  Civil War gaffathon. Now in 2016 there were actually some Democrats like Jonathan Shade and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=186.42s)]
*  I think Matt Iglesias and others who at first were saying Democrats should be happy with Trump [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=196.18s)]
*  as a nominee because he was the most moderate and then they changed and they said Trump would be the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=203.38s)]
*  best person for Hillary to run against because he would be the weakest candidate and as usual they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  got exposed as knowing absolutely nothing about politics even though they write for about it for [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=214.66s)]
*  a living. But that is one tactic when you try and encourage your voters to vote for the candidate [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=219.06s)]
*  that you think is the weakest, the Democrats actually did that effectively in the 2022 midterm [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=226.89999999999998s)]
*  where they funded some of the candidates in the Republican primary who they thought would be the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=233.22s)]
*  weakest general election candidates and most of the people that Democrats backed that got the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=238.5s)]
*  nominee for the Republican nomination for the Republican party actually ended up losing in close [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  races. This is not that strategy. The Democrats here, Chris Hayes, Brian Buller are not saying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=248.1s)]
*  we want Democrats to go and vote for Nikki Haley because she would be the weakest candidate against [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=254.42s)]
*  Joe Biden. They're not invoking this as a tactical argument. They're saying as Americans we want [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  the best people to be running against each other and while we as Democrats believe Joe Biden is [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=267.14s)]
*  the best president, we think the second best candidate, the person we think would be president [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=272.74s)]
*  the best president after Joe Biden is Nikki Haley. That's from the liberal democratic perspective. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=278.02s)]
*  So here is what Brian Buller writes, quote, she would be a terrible president who would empower [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=285.62s)]
*  even worse people, people much like Ramoswami in fact, to undermine the country's freedoms and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=289.62s)]
*  punish its liberal enclaves where most people live. In a just world nobody who's too scared to stand up [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  to neo-confederates would ever hold any office but she's a person of higher character and more [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=300.9s)]
*  ethical purpose than Donald Trump. She's running for president because she wants a big prize, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=307.06s)]
*  a bad reason, not because she wants to stay out of prison, a worse reason. If she were to lose the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=312.5s)]
*  election she'd probably admit it which is more than we can say about Trump who once again insisted [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=317.46s)]
*  it was stolen. Now when I went and noted on Twitter that this is a case where liberals were saying [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=322.42s)]
*  that they like Nikki Haley better than any other Republican presidential candidate, Brian Buller [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=330.82s)]
*  responded and said yes that's exactly what I'm saying. He posted part of his article where he [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=335.62s)]
*  was making the case for Nikki Haley and it is amazing to me that if you look at what Nikki Haley [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=338.82s)]
*  actually believes she's by far the most enthusiastic supporter of all American wars. She has not only [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=346.9s)]
*  supported literally every American war over the past 20 or 25 years. She's not one of those people [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=354.5s)]
*  who regrets her support for the Iraq war but she thinks the United States has not fought enough [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=360.82s)]
*  wars. She wants more wars. She's already calling for a bombing of Iran. She wanted Netanyahu to go [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=366.34s)]
*  to town in Gaza without limits. Obviously she's fanatically supportive of the war in Ukraine [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=374.82s)]
*  and wants the U.S. to fund that too and she's a very enthusiastic and robust supporter of the U.S. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=381.3s)]
*  security state of the CIA, of the FBI, of Homeland Security, of the NSA because she's an authoritarian [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=388.1s)]
*  as evidenced by her call to force Americans to register with their government ID if they want to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=393.06s)]
*  participate on the internet. And you would think that comparing that to say the fact that Trump was [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=397.86s)]
*  the first president in decades not to involve the United States in a new war that that would give [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=405.22s)]
*  you pause about praising Nikki Haley this way. But Democrats and liberals don't care about those [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=413.22s)]
*  issues. They don't care about new wars. They're happy with them. Biden got the United States [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=421.14000000000004s)]
*  involved in two new wars in Ukraine and in Israel. They don't care about that. Democrats don't care [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=425.22s)]
*  about opposing the CIA and the FBI and Homeland Security and the NSA because we've shown you polls [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=433.94000000000005s)]
*  many times showing that Democrats actually view those agencies positively and they trust them [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=440.02s)]
*  and see them as allies. So in this preference you can see how the Democratic Party and their media [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=444.82s)]
*  spokespeople like Chris Hayes or Brian Butler what their priorities are and they don't care at all [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=451.94s)]
*  about neoconservative warmongering or support for the U.S. security state. In fact that is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=457.14s)]
*  endemic to the Democratic Party and in that view they see the world completely [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=463.14s)]
*  similarly to the leading neocons which is why neocons are now Democrats. Here is David Frum [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  back in late December, December 28th saying exactly the same thing as Chris Hayes or Brian [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  Butler. He wrote quote, you dunk but Nikki Haley winning the Republican nomination in 2024 to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  present voters with a Biden Haley choice is the pivot that pulls America off the dark timeline and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=489.22s)]
*  onto the light one. Biden Haley that is the way that we get America to be back on the path of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=496.74s)]
*  light and not darkness. So says David Frum and Chris Hayes and Brian Butler and that is why there [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=504.74s)]
*  is a complete union of American liberals and neoconservatives because they see the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=511.78s)]
*  world exactly the same way and you can see that in their preference scheme. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKWPXC7Cek&t=518.74s)]
