# Zelensky Brings Delusional “Peace Deal” to Davos
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM)
*  So the Davos conference has become shorthand for the contempt that people have for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=0.0s)]
*  global elite. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=11.46s)]
*  And for good reason, it's this swanky week long gathering of all the worst elites, not [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=12.46s)]
*  just in the West, but the Gulf state tyrants and the oil mavens and the bankers and financiers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=18.28s)]
*  in Asia all get together and sort of plan and gather with one another and just kind [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=26.08s)]
*  of reinforce each other's elite status. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=32.36s)]
*  But there's a lot of policies that come out of Davos as well. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=34.96s)]
*  And one of the people present at Davos this year, this week in fact, is Ukrainian President [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=37.44s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky, who somehow was able to leave Ukraine and his daily supervision of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  this war as the Supreme General on the front line in fatigues in that costume that he wears [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=50.16s)]
*  supervising the war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=57.16s)]
*  He was able to go to Davos, thankfully, and for the first time, and it's kind of amazing, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=58.16s)]
*  he did not go there to ask for more money. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=62.76s)]
*  As we speak, President Biden is meeting with congressional leaders in the White House. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=65.89999999999999s)]
*  The current status is that President Biden asked for $110 billion in emergency funding, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=71.28s)]
*  $14 billion for Israel, $60 billion for Ukraine, and then the rest, another $40 billion or [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=77.11999999999999s)]
*  so for various programs. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=84.94s)]
*  But $60 billion is what they really want, which is for Ukraine to keep that war funded. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, everyone's going to vote for the $14 billion for Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=91.88s)]
*  Nobody questions money going to Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=95.08s)]
*  But $60 billion in Ukraine, there's a significant chunk of the Republican caucus opposed to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  that and questioning that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=101.6s)]
*  If it gets to the floor, it will definitely pass by a significant majority because there's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=104.72s)]
*  more than enough Democrats. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=110.2s)]
*  In fact, every Democrat will vote yes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=111.2s)]
*  There'll be more than enough pro-war hawks in the Republican Party to join with the Democrats [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=112.76s)]
*  and form a majority. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=116.84s)]
*  Right now, the position of Mike Johnson is he won't, the Speaker of the House, is he [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=118.8s)]
*  won't bring that bill to the floor unless there are very serious and substantive concessions [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=122.64s)]
*  made by the White House to give the Republicans the kind of border security that they have [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=129.52s)]
*  long been asking for, things like walls and very real efforts to keep people out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=134.28s)]
*  And obviously, Joe Biden has a major problem because if he offers serious concessions to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  toughen up the border and prevent people from getting in and even taking people who have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=147.08s)]
*  recently arrived and deporting them, he's going to have a lot of problems with major [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=151.88s)]
*  constituencies in his party who have been told for four years that these kinds of border [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  policies that Donald Trump has wanted are fascist and are white nationalist and are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=161.33999999999997s)]
*  racist and designed to keep brown people out of our country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=166.66s)]
*  But if he doesn't agree to these things, not only is he going to have the political vulnerability [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=170.38s)]
*  of an insecure border, but he's also going to be impeded from what he really wants, which [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  is $60 billion for Ukraine to keep this war going. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=180.66s)]
*  Now, Zelensky is appearing at this Davos conference knowing that Western capitals have grown tired [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=184.9s)]
*  of the Ukraine war and especially transferring tens of billions of dollars there for a war [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=189.82s)]
*  that only gets worse for Ukraine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=194.96s)]
*  They can't win. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  They have a massive artillery shortage. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  They simply don't have enough people to fight any longer. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=201.5s)]
*  They're dragging 50-year-old disabled and obese people off buses and sending them against [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  their will to the front line. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=207.82s)]
*  They expanded recently the list of people who can be conscripted to include all kinds [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=210.22s)]
*  of horrible crippling diseases and congenital defects. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=214.4s)]
*  They're just grabbing anyone they can and just throwing them into the front line as [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=219.88s)]
*  cannon fodder because they don't have enough people to fight and they never will. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=222.9s)]
*  The Russians have held these defensive positions for more than a year now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=228.08s)]
*  They occupy and control 20% of Ukraine. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  And if anything is moving, it's the Russians expanding and taking over more cities. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=235.32s)]
*  There's no way for Ukraine to do anything but make a real peace deal with Russia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=239.8s)]
*  It could have been done two years ago, but that Biden and Boris Johnson said no to and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=244.2s)]
*  therefore this war continued. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands of people at least have died since then on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=252.72s)]
*  both sides and Ukraine is destroyed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=255.76s)]
*  We're going to come in and who do you think is going to pay for its reconstruction? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=258.52s)]
*  The United States will. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=261.2s)]
*  It'll go to Black Rock and JP Morgan, all these vultures that are just waiting. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=263.48s)]
*  A lot of them are Davos to, quote, do business with Kiev. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Imagine how much money is going to flood Kiev with this reconstruction. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=271.12s)]
*  But here is the, quote, unquote, peace deal that Zelensky is now calling for. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=275.64s)]
*  There is the New York Times headline. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=280.6s)]
*  Zelensky calls for peace, not more weapons in Davos. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=282.04s)]
*  Quote, in a speech in Switzerland, the Ukrainian president asked for more sanctions on Moscow, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=285.8s)]
*  but he did not appeal for weaponry for new offenses. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=290.6s)]
*  Mr. Zelensky dressed in olive green pants and a black crew neck sweater. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=293.48s)]
*  Somehow he has time to leave the battle heavy front lines where he usually is present manning [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=299.92s)]
*  the war. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=307.36s)]
*  He's able to go to Davos, but he can't put on a suit because he has to wear that war [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  costume that the West has fallen in love with. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=312.92s)]
*  The New York Times describes it as olive green pants and a black crew neck sweater. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=315.56s)]
*  So he was well dressed and nice war chic for Davos. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=319.0s)]
*  He was greeted with applause when he walked on stage in a room packed with hundreds of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=323.6s)]
*  people at the forum, a high profile gathering of business and financial elites. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=327.08s)]
*  In his speech, he promised a Ukrainian peace plan and called for stiffer sanctions on Russia. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=331.2s)]
*  But in contrast with his comments to the forum last year, Mr. Zelensky made no direct appeals [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  for weaponry for new offenses on the battlefield. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=340.28s)]
*  Quote, we need you in Ukraine to build, to reconstruct, to restore our lives, he told [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=343.4s)]
*  the audience of investors. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=349.28s)]
*  Each of you can even be more successful with Ukraine. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=351.24s)]
*  Obviously what they want to do, the massive amount of money that has flown into Kiev, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=355.72s)]
*  nobody knows where that money has gone as we've shown you many times, is starting to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=359.76s)]
*  dry up and now he wants a new flow of cash from the West, which is the money that will [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=363.56s)]
*  go to rebuilding Ukraine. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=367.56s)]
*  And that will be a whole new source of money that will come from the American public into [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=370.68s)]
*  the coffers of Kiev. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=374.88s)]
*  Imagine the buildings they're going to build and the buildings they're going to restore [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=376.0s)]
*  and who's going to finance that and how much money will be made. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  Quote, Mr. Zelensky's highlighted his country's plan to end the war, an initiative called [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=384.44s)]
*  the Peace Formula, which has gained the backing of dozens of countries. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=389.2s)]
*  But those countries do not include Russia and Moscow has rejected its terms. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=393.8s)]
*  Now, what is this peace plan that so many people are on board with but that Russia said, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=397.48s)]
*  and you see there in the New York Times trying to apply it unreasonably, won't accept? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=407.04s)]
*  What is this peace plan that Zelensky is offering? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=410.08s)]
*  Here's what it is. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=412.44s)]
*  The plan calls for, number one, a full Russian withdraw from all Ukrainian territory, including [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=414.32s)]
*  Crimea. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=420.12s)]
*  So Russia has spent the last two years pouring enormous amounts of money into this war, losing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=422.16s)]
*  at least 100,000 Russians, probably a lot more, in order to take all of this territory [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=428.04s)]
*  that it says are filled with ethnic Russians, Russian-speaking people in Ukraine who don't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=434.18s)]
*  want to be under the central government of Kiev but who want to be part of Russia or [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=439.48s)]
*  who at least want to be independent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=442.52s)]
*  They've been fighting a war of independence for eight years. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=443.72s)]
*  They've had Crimea since 2014. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=447.08s)]
*  And so Zelensky's peace plan is they're just going to give that all back. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=450.36s)]
*  They're going to leave Ukraine. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=453.64s)]
*  They're going to just give all back the territory that they've taken, that they've, with so [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=454.64s)]
*  much of their citizens' blood, have been able to regain as a buffer against the West. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=459.2s)]
*  And they're going to give back Crimea, which they've had since 2014 and which they have [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=463.88s)]
*  said is of existential importance to their security. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=467.76s)]
*  But they're not only going to do that under this plan, they're also going to agree to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=472.44s)]
*  pay for reparations, so they're going to pay Ukraine, and they're going to agree to submit [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=479.68s)]
*  to prosecution of war crimes. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  So Putin's going to give back all the land that he has taken. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=489.34s)]
*  He's then going to transfer all the Russian treasury to Ukraine, and he's going to say, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=493.56s)]
*  okay, now I'm going to the Hague to be tried for war crimes. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=499.56s)]
*  This is such a delusional offer, the kind of thing that you would offer if you have [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=503.4s)]
*  routed the Russians and captured all of their troops and crippled their economy and destroyed [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=508.0s)]
*  the country, and now you're forcing unconditional surrender on them. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=513.2s)]
*  Why would anybody describe this as a peace plan? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=517.2s)]
*  This is a demand by the losing party that the winning party unconditionally surrender. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=519.48s)]
*  Oh, you think Putin rejected this plan? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=525.36s)]
*  The only thing that Ukraine could possibly negotiate for is for the Russians to keep [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  some portion of eastern Ukraine and give those provinces some sort of independent or autonomous [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=538.04s)]
*  or at least a referendum to allow the citizens of those provinces to decide, do they want [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=545.44s)]
*  to be part of Russia, do they want to be part of Kiev, do they want to be part of, or do [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=550.1600000000001s)]
*  they want to be independent, similar to the referendum that was given to the people of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=555.96s)]
*  Kosovo when it was time to justify independence of Kosovo and splitting Kosovo from Serbia, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  as was done in the late 1990s after the US bombardment of Serbia. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=564.9200000000001s)]
*  That would be the model. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=571.0s)]
*  And then you would actually have to have the Ukrainians agree they're not going to go into [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=573.12s)]
*  NATO, they're going to be a neutral country, they give Russia the security that it needs [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=576.52s)]
*  from the West that the West won't keep expanding up to their border. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=580.08s)]
*  But to offer a peace plan like this, it would be like if Hamas tomorrow says, okay, we have [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=584.08s)]
*  a peace plan for you Israel, you're going to withdraw all your troops from Gazan territory, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=588.92s)]
*  then you're going to transfer $100 billion from Israel to Gaza to allow us to rebuild [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=596.4s)]
*  everything that you've destroyed, and Netanyahu is going to be hanging in the public square [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  along with his top 12 officials that we select. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=607.68s)]
*  It would be as if Gaza offered that peace plan and somebody would say, well, you're [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=612.0s)]
*  obviously, you know, that maybe is what should happen, but you're obviously in no position [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=615.92s)]
*  to offer that, you're not winning this war, you're actually, you don't have an army, you [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=620.56s)]
*  don't have a military, you're getting crushed. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=624.6s)]
*  That is what this is like. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=628.36s)]
*  It is, remember we showed you before this article from Time Magazine back in November [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=629.36s)]
*  where top Zelensky officials ran to Time Magazine to warn the West that Zelensky was completely [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=634.44s)]
*  delusional and that here it is, everybody in Kiev understands that the war is basically [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=640.38s)]
*  over except for Zelensky. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=647.0s)]
*  That's the Time Magazine article from November 1st. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=650.0400000000001s)]
*  Everybody believes in our victory like I do. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=654.0s)]
*  Inside Vladimir Zelensky struggled to keep Ukraine in the fight and you see there the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=656.0s)]
*  text, Zelensky's stubbornness, some of it they'd say has hurt their team's efforts [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=663.36s)]
*  to come up with a new strategy, a new message. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=668.16s)]
*  As they have debated the future of the war, one issue has remained taboo. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=670.18s)]
*  The possibility of negotiating a peace deal, one issue has remained taboo, the possibility [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=673.96s)]
*  of negotiating a peace deal with the Russians. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=684.6s)]
*  Despite the recent setbacks on the battlefield, Zelensky does not intend to give up fighting [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=687.48s)]
*  or to sue for any kind of peace. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=691.64s)]
*  On the contrary, his belief in Ukraine's ultimate victory over Russia has hardened into a form [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=694.32s)]
*  that worries some of his advisors. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  It is immovable verging on the messianic, quote, he deludes himself. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=701.2s)]
*  One of his closest aides tells me in frustration, we're out of options, we're not winning, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=705.44s)]
*  but try telling him that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  So this is what we have here. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=711.72s)]
*  We have on the one hand a leader of a country who is the head of this country who's war [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=713.2s)]
*  war financing, who is delusional according to his own aides and officials, he's not [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=719.08s)]
*  living in reality. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=725.84s)]
*  And he shows up at Davos with a peace plan that is a complete joke. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=727.4s)]
*  And then your time says a lot of people are on board with this, like the West, but Moscow [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=733.44s)]
*  isn't ready to accept this deal. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=738.32s)]
*  As though this is any sort of a serious deal, as though this is anything remotely resembling [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=741.4s)]
*  what would actually have to happen for this war to end. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ynZH3J4yM&t=745.24s)]
