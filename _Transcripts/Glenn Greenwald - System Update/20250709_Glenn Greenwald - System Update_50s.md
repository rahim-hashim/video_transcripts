# We still don't know if Epstein had foreign intelligence ties...
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ)
*  She was asked a very specific question, which as I keep saying is a key question, if not the key question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=0.0s)]
*  For me, it's the key question because it's never been answered, including in their statements yesterday, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=6.4s)]
*  which is, did Jeffrey Epstein work for the Foreigner or Domestic Intelligence Agency? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  And you notice they're not answering that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=15.1s)]
*  She said, I don't have any knowledge of that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=16.7s)]
*  We'll have to get back to you, as though that wasn't even something that they looked at. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  But we're never going to get an answer on that because Trump is saying, how dare you even ask about it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Pam Bondi is saying, that's it on Epstein. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=24.5s)]
*  There's evidence to connect Jeffrey Epstein to Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=26.6s)]
*  And we went over it up last night. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=29.8s)]
*  I'm not saying I believe or know that he was working in some way with the Israeli government [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=31.0s)]
*  or intelligence agencies in that government or with the CIA or with intelligence agencies within the US government. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=38.2s)]
*  But that's certainly something we ought to know. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=43.5s)]
*  And do you see they're still not saying it? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0B7FfVSbQ&t=45.7s)]
