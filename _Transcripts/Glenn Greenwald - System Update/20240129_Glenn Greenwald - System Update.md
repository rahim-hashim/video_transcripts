# Smoking Gun? New Video of 1/6 Pipe Bomb Raises More Questions, w/ Darren Beattie
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y)
*  Ever since January 6th emerged, it has been characterized by a lot of things, one of which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  has been a series of lies that were told both by the government and by the media, all with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=11.84s)]
*  the intention of making that day seem far more serious and menacing and dangerous than [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=18.0s)]
*  it actually was. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=24.36s)]
*  One of the worst examples was the continuous, repetitive and melodramatic claim that the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=25.72s)]
*  people who went to protests that day took a fire extinguisher and bashed in the skull [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=31.56s)]
*  of a Capitol Hill police officer named Brian Sicknick to the point where they murdered [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=37.44s)]
*  him in a very gruesome way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=40.92s)]
*  And over and over for hours and hours throughout that day, one media outlet after the next [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  continued to repeat that claim. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=47.72s)]
*  It was their leading reason why this mob was a horde of murderous monsters and it turned [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=49.96s)]
*  out to be a complete lie. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=56.0s)]
*  Brian Sicknick went that night, called his mother, said he was fine, said he felt great, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=57.2s)]
*  didn't even go to the hospital. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=62.4s)]
*  He didn't die on January 6th as they claimed over and over. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  In fact, no one died on January 6th except for four different pro-Trump supporters, two [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=66.52s)]
*  of whom dropped out of a heart attack, one from a speed overdose and one Ashley Vabbitt [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=72.36s)]
*  who was killed by a Capitol Hill police officer who shot her at point blank range. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=76.4s)]
*  And so Brian Sicknick didn't die until the next day and the coroner determined that he [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  died of natural causes, not by having his skull bashed in with a fire extinguisher. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=85.68s)]
*  And this is what you see in these events all the time are all kinds of lies in order to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=90.0s)]
*  scare people into believing that the event is much worse than it is and that they become [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  more submissive and more willing to give up power to the institutions of authority like [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=99.12s)]
*  the CIA and the FBI and the members of Congress who wanted to seize a lot of power in the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=103.96s)]
*  name of fighting this scary, insurrectionary movement. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=108.52s)]
*  And one of the main stories that actually emerged that fueled this narrative was the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  claim that a domestic terrorist actually planted very dangerous pipe bombs, one at the Democratic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  National Committee headquarters, the other at the Republican National Committee headquarters, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  one of which came very close to being able to threaten the physical safety of the Vice [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=128.4s)]
*  President-elect of the United States, Kamala Harris. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=134.16s)]
*  Fast forward two years later, actually almost three years later, and we have no idea who [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=138.16s)]
*  this pipe bomber was. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=144.4s)]
*  We're talking about one of the most surveilled areas in one of the most surveilled cities [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=145.4s)]
*  in all of the United States, Washington, D.C., near the Capitol, near all of the major centers [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=150.04s)]
*  of state power, and somehow the FBI has not been able to find who it is who supposedly [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=154.66s)]
*  planted these pipe bombs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  Now one of the journalists who has been, one of the very few who has been intrepid and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=162.74s)]
*  aggressive about questioning a lot of these narratives and challenging them and proving [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=167.38s)]
*  with evidence that some of them is false is our friend, friend of the show, who's appeared [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=172.06s)]
*  many times to talk about his reporting along the way, Darren Beatty, who is a political [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  scientist from Duke and a former Trump speechwriter and the founder of Revolver News, where he [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=181.24s)]
*  has done a lot of this reporting and he has now obtained some evidence, some video evidence [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=185.92s)]
*  that came, I believe, from Thomas Massey in the Capitol that has helped him really break [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=191.44s)]
*  down a lot of the bizarre doubts about the narrative that emerged specifically about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=195.96s)]
*  this pipe bomber. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=201.4s)]
*  We're always happy to have Darren on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=202.4s)]
*  He is always very thoughtful in everything he has to say, very measured in his words [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=203.68s)]
*  and in his claims, and we are always delighted to see him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  Darren, great to see you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for coming on and talk to us about this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=213.11999999999998s)]
*  Fantastic to be back. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=215.55999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Glenn. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=218.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=219.2s)]
*  So before we get into these specifics and this new evidence and kind of the questions [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=220.2s)]
*  that have been raised, you know, one of the things I always try and stress because I've [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=223.04s)]
*  noticed this so often is that so often when there's a event that can be used by the government [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  to put the population into greater degrees of fear, there's always an attempt to kind [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=234.76s)]
*  of try and exaggerate how bad it actually was. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=239.76s)]
*  Even if it is bad, there's always an attempt to kind of add scary claims about it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=244.16s)]
*  This was done with anthrax and I think people have forgotten how crucial the anthrax attacks [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=250.04s)]
*  were to elevating the climate of fear after 9-11 to make people think that it's not just [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=254.84s)]
*  the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that can be attacked, but suburbanites in their [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=260.4s)]
*  own home through their mailbox, one of the kind of safest symbols of American safety [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=263.76s)]
*  and the role that played in elevating fear. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Just before we get into the details, talk about the importance of this claim about how [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=271.88s)]
*  these pipe bombs were laid and how that was used to create a narrative about January 6th. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=276.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=285.36s)]
*  There are a number of dimensions to this and there are two major categories that we've [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=289.32s)]
*  covered extensively and really launched in the national conversation that I call the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=295.76s)]
*  twin smoking guns of the feds' erection. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=300.48s)]
*  One is the story of Ray Epps, which we've talked about in another context, and the other [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=303.76s)]
*  is the story of the pipe bomb, which we've covered extensively for almost three years [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=309.04s)]
*  now. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, these pipe bombs, according to the FBI and according to surveillance footage presented [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=315.56s)]
*  to us from the FBI, incidentally, surveillance footage that comes from the DNC surveillance [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=322.28s)]
*  cameras, we'll get to that in a bit. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=327.08s)]
*  According to this footage in the FBI, these pipe bombs were planted the evening before [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=330.96s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=335.4s)]
*  There's one pipe bomb that's called the RNC pipe bomb, but really the whole RNC-DNC parallelism [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=337.73999999999995s)]
*  is something of a retroactive fiction. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=344.02s)]
*  The pipe bomb that was first discovered but planted second behind a back alley, beyond [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=348.38s)]
*  a trash can in a back alley near the Capitol Hill Club, that was planted around 830. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=355.02s)]
*  There is the second pipe bomb, the DNC pipe bomb, that was planted at approximately 8 [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=362.02s)]
*  p.m. according to the footage. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=369.5s)]
*  Now, the surveillance footage presented to us by the FBI that comes via the DNC. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  This latest bit of footage that you mentioned, and I think the footage itself is a good segue [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=379.14s)]
*  into the larger pipe bomb story because no matter where you are in terms of your understanding [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=384.02s)]
*  of the overwhelming evidence that the pipe bomb situation is dirty and indeed some type [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=390.02s)]
*  of operation, the video itself that we're about to look at simply as a self-contained [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=395.98s)]
*  matter is explosive and scandalous no matter how you look at it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=402.46000000000004s)]
*  Even if you close your eyes and ears to the overwhelming evidence of federal involvement [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=407.22s)]
*  in January 6th, this video as a self-contained matter is pretty explosive and I'd like to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=411.82s)]
*  walk the audience through it if you guys have some clips on B-roll. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=418.06s)]
*  Here we have an individual with a backpack approaching these two SUVs. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=423.58s)]
*  We now know that individual is a plainclothes Capitol Police officer. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=427.94s)]
*  He's informing the SUV here, the driver's side. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=432.53999999999996s)]
*  This is a Metro PD SUV. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=436.96s)]
*  He's informing the individuals in this car of the presence of a pipe bomb merely feet [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=439.46s)]
*  away. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=444.29999999999995s)]
*  This isn't just an ordinary Metro PD car. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=445.58s)]
*  This is part of a Secret Service detail and the black SUV is Secret Service, but even [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=448.58s)]
*  the Metro PD car is part of the Secret Service detail. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=454.06s)]
*  Here we see the person go to the black SUV. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=458.06s)]
*  He's informing the individuals there, the detail, the Secret Service officers, the presence [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=460.7s)]
*  of a pipe bomb merely feet away and ultimately the camera will pan to the benches where the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  pipe bomb is placed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=470.9s)]
*  Now the first strange thing about this is after being informed, this is Secret Service, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=473.02s)]
*  after being informed of the presence of a pipe bomb merely feet away, it will take them [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  over a minute to even bother getting out of their vehicles, at which point they simply [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=487.94s)]
*  stand and lounge around in the most lackadaisical fashion imaginable. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  If viewers can see it here or they can go to revolver.news and watch the video, watch [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=501.65999999999997s)]
*  the video for yourselves and ask yourself, is this how I would imagine the Secret Service [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=506.85999999999996s)]
*  would respond to being informed of the presence of a pipe bomb? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=512.5s)]
*  While this whole thing is happening, you have people walking by, like just civilians walking [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=515.98s)]
*  very close to these cars. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=520.98s)]
*  I'm getting to that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=523.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=524.5s)]
*  I just like, even in this first video where, I'm sorry, I should have asked this before [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=525.5s)]
*  I don't mean to interrupt your train of thought, I apologize, but are we only seeing these [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=529.34s)]
*  videos now and where did they come from? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=533.3s)]
*  How did we get access to these videos? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=536.42s)]
*  So there is a bunch of footage obviously from the Capitol Police. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=540.22s)]
*  This security camera is a Capitol Police security camera. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=544.1s)]
*  It was not released in the 70, 90 or so hours that the new speaker released, even though [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=549.1s)]
*  he promised 40,000, it kind of got lost in the whole hoopla over the other Capitol videos. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=555.02s)]
*  This was a specialized thing. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=562.66s)]
*  This is something that Thomas Massey, as a result of extensive conversations and his [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=564.42s)]
*  deep familiarity with our research at revolver.news, he actually has taken an active interest in [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=570.72s)]
*  this pipe bomb question specifically. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=576.1s)]
*  And he kind of heroically persisted with Kevin McCarthy directly to the point that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=579.14s)]
*  he had some leverage with Kevin McCarthy and basically used it on this. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=586.66s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy was forced to pull teeth to get this video released. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=591.98s)]
*  This is only seven minutes, but I think without question, this is the most important January [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=596.88s)]
*  6th video in existence. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=602.9s)]
*  It was sort of released very quietly and it's been out for four months, but nobody's really [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=605.6600000000001s)]
*  told a story of how and why this is so significant. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=614.1s)]
*  And this is what I've done recently and now it's kind of everywhere because it's so self-evident [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  once you see it that here you have a Secret Service detail being informed the presence [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=623.98s)]
*  of an explosive device. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=629.26s)]
*  There is an extraordinary lack of concern, not only for themselves, for their own lives, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=631.62s)]
*  for the life of their protectee who is then VP-elect Kamala Harris. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=637.58s)]
*  And we'll get to that in a second. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=641.38s)]
*  That's very significant. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=642.98s)]
*  And most egregiously, as you point out, pedestrians walking by, in fact, the most flagrant example [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=644.86s)]
*  of this is another clip, which you guys may or may not have, it's fine if you don't, of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=650.4s)]
*  a group of children actually crossing the street in the direction of this pipe bomb, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=655.38s)]
*  walking within feet of the benches where the pipe bomb is placed, and the Secret Service [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=662.38s)]
*  agents are just standing there not warning them, not a care in the world for these kids [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=666.9399999999999s)]
*  for themselves, for Kamala. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=671.14s)]
*  It's very clear that these Secret Service agents know that the pipe bomb is a dud, that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=673.76s)]
*  it's inert, that it's fake, that it poses no danger. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=680.66s)]
*  And the obvious question is, how the hell did the Secret Service agents know that this [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=684.34s)]
*  bomb is a dud? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=688.58s)]
*  An interesting addition of detail. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=690.1s)]
*  Let's look at the second video. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=693.82s)]
*  I think we have three clips. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=694.82s)]
*  So just if you could, are you able to see these on the screen as we're playing them? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=696.7s)]
*  I am, yeah. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=701.2600000000001s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=702.2600000000001s)]
*  So let's look at the second one and tell us what we're seeing here. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=703.2600000000001s)]
*  This one is from 10643. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=712.0200000000001s)]
*  This is not going to be the children crossing. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=713.9s)]
*  The children crossing is approximately 109, somewhere in the 109 area. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=716.3s)]
*  But I mean, still the idea is now by now they have been informed that there is supposedly [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=722.5799999999999s)]
*  a dangerous pipe bomb. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=727.62s)]
*  Yeah, this is the part where they sit around in their vehicle for about a minute, as I [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=728.62s)]
*  mentioned. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=732.5799999999999s)]
*  They sit around in their vehicle after being informed for almost a minute, then they get [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=733.5799999999999s)]
*  out, then there's about two minutes of them just lackadaisically standing around with [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=736.8199999999999s)]
*  no concern whatsoever. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=741.2199999999999s)]
*  So they stand at approximately the 109 minute mark. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=744.02s)]
*  That's when you see them allow a group of children across this very street that you're [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=745.98s)]
*  looking at. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=749.5s)]
*  And at that point, the video does show the benches where the pipe bomb is actually placed. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=750.5s)]
*  Then shortly after that, a Capitol Police officer walks right up to the pipe bomb, snaps [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=755.98s)]
*  a photo, gives a thumbs up signal, after which point the Secret Service detail for the first [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=761.78s)]
*  time in the whole seven minute video actually hustle and get the hell out of Dodge. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=768.5s)]
*  This is the first time the whole video they scramble to get away. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=773.6600000000001s)]
*  Now, and then the video expires. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=775.94s)]
*  This is only seven minutes, is explosive seven minutes. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=778.6600000000001s)]
*  But I have sources who've seen a more extended version. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=781.9000000000001s)]
*  And what happened shortly after that is kind of funny because they actually get a bomb [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=785.6600000000001s)]
*  safe robot to come in and dismantle it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=790.22s)]
*  The very bomb that they were just lackadaisically standing around that they're unconcerned of [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=793.94s)]
*  its danger. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=800.26s)]
*  It poses to Kamala Harris, the VP elect, who they're supposed to be protecting, and then [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=801.54s)]
*  to this group of children, no concern. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=806.58s)]
*  And yet somehow after they get that money shot from the Capitol Police officer, gives [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=809.04s)]
*  the thumbs up, then they progress to this spectacle of getting a bomb safe robot to [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=813.58s)]
*  dismantle it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=819.26s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=820.9399999999999s)]
*  Again, it's very clear that they knew that the bomb posed no threat. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=822.26s)]
*  But the obvious follow up question is how in the world would Kamala Harris's secret [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=826.38s)]
*  service detail know that this bomb was fake? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=830.98s)]
*  Now let me get to another thing that is so obvious. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=834.38s)]
*  Before we move on to that, first of all, let me just show this third clip we have and people [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=837.02s)]
*  should go and watch all the clips on Revolver News. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=842.02s)]
*  It's also on your Twitter feed. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=844.72s)]
*  It went mega viral. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=846.82s)]
*  What is this that we're seeing here, Darren? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=848.74s)]
*  Is it just still more of them? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=850.26s)]
*  So this is, we're at 107 years. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=851.74s)]
*  So again, we're going to, and the guy is still there. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=853.94s)]
*  He hasn't left. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=856.46s)]
*  This is the person. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=857.7s)]
*  So here they are standing around lackadaisically. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=858.86s)]
*  This is after they got out of their cars. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=861.6600000000001s)]
*  So I mean, again, I described it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=864.1800000000001s)]
*  This isn't particularly interesting. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=866.08s)]
*  They're just standing around. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=867.46s)]
*  Then at the 109 is the most egregious kind of flagrant example of their unconcern because [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=868.94s)]
*  that's when you can see the children crossing. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=874.3000000000001s)]
*  And then at around 110, you can see the Capitol Police officer snapping a photo. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  So again, I invite people, they can go to revolver.news and watch these clips. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=882.38s)]
*  I think I've described them pretty well. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=885.7s)]
*  But that's the footage. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=889.5s)]
*  And as I pointed out, once the footage expires a little bit later, that's when they get the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=890.86s)]
*  bomb safe robot, which again, doesn't make any sense. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=895.3s)]
*  But let me get to an obvious and damning question. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=898.98s)]
*  Before we get there, let me just, let me say this. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=902.62s)]
*  This is the thing that when I read what you had to say, and now that I'm listening to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=905.24s)]
*  further explain is the question that I had, which is, so let's, let's say it's possible [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=909.98s)]
*  that you were able to look at this bomb and just on site kind of see that it's a joke, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=916.34s)]
*  right? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=923.54s)]
*  That it's not an actual serious threat, that it's not a real bomb that can possibly explode. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=924.54s)]
*  Like I imagine if I tried to create a pipe bomb, you would immediately look at it and [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=930.26s)]
*  know that there's no chance that it would detonate. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=934.54s)]
*  But then the question becomes, why has this narrative lingered for so long that this is [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=937.98s)]
*  a serious pipe bomb? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=943.0600000000001s)]
*  Why are there no rewards out for it? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=944.94s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=947.5s)]
*  Then let me know. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=948.5s)]
*  I mean, look, anybody who's ever dealt with the Secret Service whatsoever, they're not [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=950.5s)]
*  going to make an inference and say, oh, this kind of looks like it might be fake. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=957.38s)]
*  That is a profound violation of protocol. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=964.3s)]
*  If they find something that even remotely looks like, and these were convincing, whether [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=969.26s)]
*  or not they were actually operative is another question, but you can see photos of them. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=973.78s)]
*  They don't look obviously fake. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=978.46s)]
*  And even if they were obviously fake, it's still a flagrant violation of protocol. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=981.9399999999999s)]
*  We're dealing with the Secret Service of the United States tasked with protecting the VP [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=986.38s)]
*  elect, the first woman of color VP elect. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=991.2199999999999s)]
*  Anybody who's dealt with the Secret Service knows that there is zero chance that according [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=994.6999999999999s)]
*  to normal protocol, they would just see it and make a guess and say, this kind of looks [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=999.14s)]
*  fake. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1003.9799999999999s)]
*  So that needs to be ruled out. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1004.9799999999999s)]
*  Well, and again, I was just reading that devil's argument. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1007.78s)]
*  I'm just saying that was a defense of them. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1011.9399999999999s)]
*  So OK, we looked at this pipe bomb. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1014.8199999999999s)]
*  We didn't really jump and get all excited because we knew it was fake. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1016.58s)]
*  But then why wasn't that part of the story from the beginning? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1020.22s)]
*  Like, let me point it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1024.06s)]
*  Let me point this. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1025.8600000000001s)]
*  Let me point this other thing out is that this is at 105. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1026.8600000000001s)]
*  This is already after that first pipe bomb was discovered at 1240 p.m. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1030.9s)]
*  So another bomb had already been discovered, which is also kind of bizarre. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1037.3400000000001s)]
*  And I'd like to get to the full narrative of that. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1043.22s)]
*  Let me jump to the first obvious and damning. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1045.74s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1048.46s)]
*  I'm sorry to keep interrupting. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1049.46s)]
*  I mean, we're going to take all the time we need. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1050.46s)]
*  But here I just want to show you we actually do have the video clip at 109. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1052.82s)]
*  So since you've referenced it several times, I just want people to be able to see it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1057.3400000000001s)]
*  I think this is where the children are crossing just so people can visualize what you've been [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1060.6200000000001s)]
*  describing. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1063.98s)]
*  I think this is the clip that you were talking about. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1065.14s)]
*  Where there are people walking by. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1069.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so the bomb is right by the foot of that further bench. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1072.42s)]
*  And notice there's a cup of coffee that's open. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1078.54s)]
*  It's a very windy day. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1081.98s)]
*  So that cup of coffee, empty cup of coffee is the mug, whatever it's called. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1083.54s)]
*  That had not been there for a long time. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1091.1000000000001s)]
*  Someone was sitting there very recently. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1093.6200000000001s)]
*  And I'd love to know who. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1095.6200000000001s)]
*  So here they are. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1097.1000000000001s)]
*  Look at how they stand around. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1098.5s)]
*  The bomb is literally at those benches. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  They're within the blast radius and they don't give a damn. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1101.98s)]
*  OK, so go ahead. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1104.78s)]
*  So go ahead with your analysis. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1106.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it stopped there. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1109.3799999999999s)]
*  Do we have this next? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1110.74s)]
*  Do we have this? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1113.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't think we have the rest of that video. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1114.2199999999998s)]
*  But no, I think it's a lost cause, but it's fine because we've described it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1116.58s)]
*  And again, the full breakdown is on the piece at Revolver News. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1119.82s)]
*  So now please let me get into the... [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1124.3s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1126.1399999999999s)]
*  I promise I won't interrupt. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1127.1399999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1128.58s)]
*  OK, because it gets to what you were saying about how in every other domain, the regime [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1130.22s)]
*  is interested in amplifying and exaggerating to the point of absurdity the significance [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1135.58s)]
*  of January 6 in terms of it being a domestic terror event. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1141.9399999999998s)]
*  I should have you know in your audience, the government officially considers pipe bombs [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1146.34s)]
*  to be weapons of mass destruction, by the way. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1150.9399999999998s)]
*  So this is the most domestic terrorist element of the event that the media and the Democrats [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1153.54s)]
*  have spent considerable time and resources and energy in amplifying as a significant [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1163.86s)]
*  event of domestic terrorism. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1170.82s)]
*  Kamala Harris is in the building at this time. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1173.1399999999999s)]
*  The Secret Service agents who are utterly lackadaisical, who clearly know the bomb is [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1176.96s)]
*  fake, are part of Kamala Harris's Secret Service detail. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1180.86s)]
*  Kamala Harris studiously covered up the fact that she was in the DNC building on that day. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1185.7s)]
*  Studiously. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1196.54s)]
*  In fact, she successfully covered it up for almost a year after which point it was leaked. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1198.34s)]
*  She's never even publicly acknowledged the fact that she was there. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1204.18s)]
*  Now think about this, Glenn. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1209.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris is one of the most politically opportunistic creatures on this planet. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1211.38s)]
*  Why would she forego the opportunity to milk politically the fact that she came in within [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1219.6200000000001s)]
*  a hair's width of the January 6 pipe bomb, which according to reports had live explosives [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1226.0600000000002s)]
*  on it and had explosive material on it. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1234.6200000000001s)]
*  Why would Joe Biden for that matter, who thinks January 6 is sufficiently serious as to warrant [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1237.58s)]
*  an entire speech and look, this guy can barely get out of bed, if he's going to give a speech [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1244.6999999999998s)]
*  for longer than an hour, it means it's important to him. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1248.78s)]
*  He gave a speech on the third anniversary of January 6 for over an hour and in this [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1251.6599999999999s)]
*  time he neglected to mention that his own vice president nearly lost her life to the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1257.1799999999998s)]
*  dangerous MAGA pipe bomb. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1262.8999999999999s)]
*  That's very weird and it makes us wonder how dark and how damning and how embarrassing [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1267.02s)]
*  does the truth have to be for these salivating political opportunists to leave that yummy [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1275.42s)]
*  bar of chocolate untouched on the table. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1283.04s)]
*  You'd think that would be the most memorable and repeated talking points the whole January [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1286.46s)]
*  that Kamala Harris, the VP elect, the first woman of color, so forth and so on, was actually [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1293.82s)]
*  in the building with the pipe bomb. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1301.98s)]
*  Especially as you pointed out, I'm glad you mentioned Brian Sicknick in the intro. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1303.6599999999999s)]
*  Think of the great contortionist lengths they have to go to exaggerate this nonsense about [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1308.22s)]
*  Brian Sicknick and have that blow up in their face because it was utterly false, the story [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1314.4199999999998s)]
*  that he was bludgeoned to death by the MAGA mob. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1318.58s)]
*  But here you have an actual case of the vice president being in the building with the bomb [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1321.42s)]
*  and she doesn't mention it, Biden doesn't mention it, they actively cover that up. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1328.3400000000001s)]
*  So let me just probe that a little bit because... [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rS6jKovw3Y&t=1334.98s)]
