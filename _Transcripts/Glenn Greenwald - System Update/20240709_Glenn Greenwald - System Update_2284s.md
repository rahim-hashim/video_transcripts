# What the U.K. and French Elections Mean for Establishment Politics in Europe
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo)
*  There have been two extremely consequential elections, national elections, in two very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=0.0s)]
*  important countries, or at least relatively important countries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  One that was held in the UK, and that was a general election that happened because the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=15.4s)]
*  Prime Minister of the UK, Rishi Sunak, was nearing the end of the period where he would [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=21.12s)]
*  be required to call for general elections. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=27.6s)]
*  The person elected and becomes Prime Minister of the party has a five-year term. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  That term was ending at the end of this year, but polls showed his party is well, well behind [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=35.4s)]
*  the Labour Party. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=42.0s)]
*  His party is the Tories, the Conservatives, who have run Britain for the last 14 years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=43.0s)]
*  And for a bunch of different strategic reasons, he believed that it would be advantageous [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  to call those elections a few months earlier than he had to at the end of the year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=50.44s)]
*  And so he called elections. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=54.52s)]
*  There's a six-week, I believe, election period from the time the Prime Minister calls until [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=56.16s)]
*  the actual vote. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=61.04s)]
*  And the UK had its general election last week. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=62.04s)]
*  And the headline was that the Labour Party, the centre-left establishment Labour Party, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=66.6s)]
*  experienced some great victory or some major resurgence. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=72.92s)]
*  And while it's true that the Labour Party did end up with an absolute majority in the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=78.16s)]
*  Parliament and the Conservatives or the Tory Party collapsed, when you look at the actual [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=83.64s)]
*  data, which I think is very important to do, you will see that this was far from some sort [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=90.64s)]
*  of surge of support for the Labour Party. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=95.0s)]
*  In fact, all of the available data, which we'll go over with you in a minute, shows [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=98.6s)]
*  the exact opposite, that in fact, voters of the UK now hate both of the two parties that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  represent status quo establishment politics, including Labour and the Conservatives, and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  even though Labour ended up with something like 65% of the seats in Parliament, they [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=113.56s)]
*  only got that party 34% of the vote of all voters. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=120.36s)]
*  34% of voters in the UK voted for the Labour Party. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=124.8s)]
*  They got fewer votes, just over nine million, than they got four years ago in the general [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=129.72s)]
*  election, or five years actually ago, when they were led by Jeremy Corbyn, when they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=136.72s)]
*  got 10 million votes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=142.52s)]
*  And there was another national election held two years prior to that, 2017, also the Labour [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=145.0s)]
*  Party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, where they got 11 million votes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  So the Labour Party, far from getting this huge victory, actually got fewer votes, which [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  we'll show you in a minute, than they have, and the thing that has gone up the most are [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  non-voters, people so disgusted with the political system that they actually don't want to vote. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=165.12s)]
*  And then you have the French elections over the weekend, which we had several experts [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=170.72s)]
*  on this to discuss in advance of it, and that happened because there were elections for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=175.64s)]
*  the EU Parliament, and Marine Le Pen's right-wing party got by far the most amount of votes [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=182.2s)]
*  in that election for the EU Parliament. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=189.6s)]
*  And as a result, Emmanuel Macron, despite not needing to at all, decided he would dissolve [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=192.72s)]
*  Parliament, where his party had a majority of the seats, and the hand-picked successor [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  he chose, Gabriel Attal, this young gay Macronist who had been prime minister of the French [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Parliament, he dissolved the Parliament and decided to have new elections, and for a long [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  time it looked as though Marine Le Pen's party would end up with certainly the most amount [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=221.16s)]
*  of votes, if not an absolute majority. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=226.12s)]
*  As it turned out, that did not happen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=228.84s)]
*  The right-wing party of Marine Le Pen came in third place, Macron came in second, and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=230.48s)]
*  a coalition of left-wing parties led by what you could call a pretty far-left personality, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  Jean-Luc Mollent-Chan, ended up winning the election. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  None of those factions, none of those three has anywhere near a majority, and so it's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  extremely unclear how France will be governed in their Parliament, whether the Macronists [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=253.12s)]
*  will support a left-wing candidate to be the prime minister. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=259.24s)]
*  It looks unlikely that the right will now have as a prime minister, but France is basically [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=263.12s)]
*  in paralysis because, again, voters turned against the centrist establishment politics [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=266.72s)]
*  of Emmanuel Macron, and as a result turned either to the left or to the right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=272.68s)]
*  And this is a thing that we're seeing over and over in the democratic world. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=278.0s)]
*  You can get different outcomes at different times for specific reasons relating to the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=282.88s)]
*  moment in which the election is held in a specific country, but the trend over and over [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  in every one of these elections is growing disgust and contempt for status quo politics [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=291.32s)]
*  for the establishment institutions of the West that run the lives of people in Europe, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=296.4s)]
*  in the United States, in Canada, and throughout the democratic world. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  And these two elections, despite their kind of top-line headline, oh, labor surges to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=307.8s)]
*  a landslide victory or Macron vindicated in his choice to try and keep the far right of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=313.24s)]
*  power, end up telling very much the same story. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=317.44000000000005s)]
*  So first of all, let's go to the UK, where this election can pretty much be understood [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  in a single chart, and this is the vote share of every party from 1970 until the election [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=327.16s)]
*  that was just held in 2024. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=336.6s)]
*  Now, if you look at any newspaper headline, you will see labor wins via landslide. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=338.32000000000005s)]
*  And there is a sense in which you can justify that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=345.88s)]
*  As I said, they got 65% of the seats in parliament, an absolute majority. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=347.88s)]
*  As a result, the leader of the Labor Party, Keir Starmer, one of the most uninspiring, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=352.74s)]
*  vacant, and belief-free, craven politicians you will ever see in your entire life, was [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  elevated to the prime ministership. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=367.2s)]
*  He's now the prime minister of the UK because the Labor Party has a majority of seats in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=369.24s)]
*  the parliament. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=372.72s)]
*  But if you look at this chart, which is the percentage of the vote in every election from [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=374.48s)]
*  1970 until the one that was just held, the line that represents the Labor Party is this [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  red line here. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=384.48s)]
*  Red is the color of labor. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=385.6s)]
*  And you can see it there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=388.04s)]
*  They had this uptick in percentage right here that was in 2017 when the party was under [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=389.84s)]
*  the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=398.88s)]
*  You see the line went straight up when they had a much more aggressive anti-establishment [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=400.28s)]
*  left-wing populist politics. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=405.28s)]
*  And then under Keir Starmer, you see it drop all the way to here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  So this is the current vote total of the Labor Party. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=412.53999999999996s)]
*  It's actually one of the lowest levels that they've ever had in their history. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=417.12s)]
*  At the same time, you can take a look at the Conservative Party, which is the Tory party [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=422.64s)]
*  that ruled for the last 14 years under people like David Cameron and Theresa May and Boris [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  Johnson and then a couple of people they quickly circulated through, including Liz Truss, who [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=435.56s)]
*  was the prime minister for about 46 days and almost destroyed singlehandedly the British [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=442.2s)]
*  economy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=446.56s)]
*  Here, you see the Tory party, the Conservative Tory party, which is easily the most important [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=447.56s)]
*  and dominant party in British politics in its recent history. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=452.96s)]
*  And you can see that their trend is they had a huge collapse. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=460.2s)]
*  They went from this level here ahead of the Labor Party in 2019, and they just completely [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=464.28s)]
*  collapsed because what this election was about more than anything was discussed with [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=473.88s)]
*  the Conservative Party, with the Tories, for good reason. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=479.04s)]
*  Not only were they in power for 14 years and therefore the symbols of the status quo, they [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=481.6s)]
*  did this sort of thing in office that deservedly provoked the disgust of almost everybody regardless [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=487.08s)]
*  of political affiliation. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=492.68s)]
*  Probably their most harmful scandal was that at the beginning of the COVID pandemic through [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=495.32s)]
*  the next year and a half, the government, the British government under Boris Johnson, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  implemented some of the harshest and most suffocating stay at home and curfew and lockdown [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=503.76s)]
*  rules of any country in the democratic world. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=510.72s)]
*  People were barred from even going outside. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=513.96s)]
*  They were not able to gather in groups. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=516.9s)]
*  A lot of people lost their family members and weren't able to go to funerals. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=518.36s)]
*  And yet it turned out that the whole time the leaders of the Conservative Party and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=522.68s)]
*  the UK government were having major raucous parties inside and downing street where they [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=527.0s)]
*  all were on top of each other every night just violating all of the COVID protocols [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=533.12s)]
*  they had imposed on the entire population. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=537.32s)]
*  When they got caught, they repeatedly lied about it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=540.56s)]
*  And then by the time there was an investigation, everyone realized that they had done that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=542.78s)]
*  The Boris Johnson lied and Boris Johnson was forced to leave office despite a pretty resounding [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=547.16s)]
*  victory. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=551.96s)]
*  And from there, they just had one scandal after the next. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=552.96s)]
*  Again, not an ideological scandal, but just sleaze and corruption of the kind voters hated. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=555.2s)]
*  So you can see here this election had nothing to do with British voters turning to the center-left [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=561.08s)]
*  Labour Party. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  In fact, they're as unpopular as ever even though they won a majority. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  What happened was a collapse of the Conservative Party because they were the party in power. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=573.08s)]
*  This was an anti-establishment, anti-statistical vote. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=577.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think the most important part of what this chart shows is that this gray line is [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=581.2s)]
*  by far the highest and you see this huge increase in that gray line. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  Gray line represents people who just refuse to vote. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=593.96s)]
*  It was 40%. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=598.36s)]
*  So 40% of the British population, only one other point was it higher after 2000, was [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  the British public just of the opinion that none of these parties was worth voting for. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=610.32s)]
*  That was the only huge increase, huge shoot in this line. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=615.88s)]
*  With one exception, and you can see it here this purple line that had a very sharp incline, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=620.88s)]
*  and that is the party of Nigel Farage and the Reform Party that focuses on hardcore [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=626.96s)]
*  anti-immigration policies, on populist right-wing policies. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=631.48s)]
*  They had a sharp increase in the vote total even though they had no party structure because [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=639.76s)]
*  the Reform Party is this brand new party. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=654.4000000000001s)]
*  He used to have a different party called UKIP and they're also part of this chart here. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=657.0200000000001s)]
*  They had this big surge. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  They were the popular party during Brexit, but then they kind of disbanded. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  Then Nigel Farage came back during this election saying the Conservative Party had failed us, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=668.8399999999999s)]
*  had abandoned all of our anti-establishment politics. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=672.64s)]
*  They took a huge amount from the Conservative Party. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=676.12s)]
*  They had an increase of millions of people who voted for Nigel Farage's Reform Party, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=679.7199999999999s)]
*  took away a lot of votes from conservatives, but also a lot of people who had previously [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=684.92s)]
*  been in the Labour Party. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=688.12s)]
*  It was this kind of right-wing populism focused on immigration and jobs that is rapidly becoming [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=690.4399999999999s)]
*  a more and more popular ideology across all of Europe. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  So you can just see this tells the real story of what the actual population thinks. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=701.12s)]
*  There was a little bit of an increase for the Green Party, this kind of centrist party [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=706.52s)]
*  called the Liberal Democrats didn't really have a huge increase in vote total, but they [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  ended up getting something like 71 seats in parliament just because of strategic expenditures [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  of resources. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=721.24s)]
*  But in terms of the population, the only thing you can say is that they hate anyone associated [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=722.24s)]
*  with the status quo with the establishment, including both the Conservative Party, this [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=727.52s)]
*  establishment, centre-right Tory party and the centre-left Labour Party. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=731.56s)]
*  It's very important to see the UK election for what it actually is rather than what the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=736.88s)]
*  headlines were leading a lot of people to believe. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=740.56s)]
*  Now just to show you a little bit of more detail about this, here is the Labour Party's [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=743.48s)]
*  vote total in the last three elections. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=751.0799999999999s)]
*  Here you see in 2017 under Jeremy Corbyn, who's a populist anti-establishment left-wing [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=755.52s)]
*  leader, they got 12,800,000 votes, almost 13 million votes in 2017 under Corbyn. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=762.68s)]
*  In 2019 in the general election under Corbyn, where the Tories won by a big majority under [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=771.04s)]
*  Boris Johnson, the Labour Party got 10,200,000 votes. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=777.0s)]
*  And we always heard that Corbyn was a disaster for the Labour Party, he drove the Labour [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=783.44s)]
*  Party into the ground, he drove everybody away with his left-wing populist policies. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=787.12s)]
*  But if you compare the vote total that Labour got under Corbyn in the last two elections [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=793.2800000000001s)]
*  to the vote total that Keir Starmer just got in 2024, you see that the vote total has been [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=796.6400000000001s)]
*  declining for the Labour Party and that if you compare what the Labour Party got in 2017 [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=801.32s)]
*  under Corbyn to what Keir Starmer just got with the Labour Party in this last election, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=807.4000000000001s)]
*  the one where Labour supposedly had a huge landslide victory, you see that in that time, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=812.24s)]
*  Labour has lost three million votes from basically 13 million to nine and a half million, really [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=817.4399999999999s)]
*  three and a half million votes. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=824.68s)]
*  So do you not believe any narrative that suggests that this was some victory for the centre-left [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  Labour Party in any way other than the happenstance that they ended up winning the most seats [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=831.56s)]
*  in Parliament? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=837.04s)]
*  Just to show you again how disparate the headlines are from the reality, here's a graph from [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=838.68s)]
*  the Financial Times and they have two different columns here. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=845.5999999999999s)]
*  This is the vote share that each party received and here's the percentage of the seats in [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=851.36s)]
*  Parliament that they won. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=857.24s)]
*  So you see here Labour got 34% of the vote, as we just showed you, of the overall vote [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=858.8s)]
*  of the people of the United Kingdom and yet they ended up with 65% of the votes in Parliament. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=864.9200000000001s)]
*  And you might be wondering, well how could that happen? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=871.9200000000001s)]
*  And the reason is because a lot of countries have what's called proportional voting, where [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=875.12s)]
*  you go and vote for multiple parties and more or less the parties end up with the percentage [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=880.1600000000001s)]
*  of seats in the Parliamentary House that they receive in terms of raw vote totals. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=885.1600000000001s)]
*  That's not how the UK holds their elections. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=892.08s)]
*  The UK holds their elections in what's called first past the post. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=893.6800000000001s)]
*  So you can win a constituency which is analogous to a House district with something like 23% [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  of the vote total, 25% of the vote total because the other parties divide it up and as long [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=908.72s)]
*  as you're the leading vote total, there's no runoff, there's no requirement to get 50% [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=912.64s)]
*  of the vote in a runoff, you end up winning that seat for the constituency and Labour [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  ended up winning so many seats with a very small vote total, in part because the Conservatives [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=922.4799999999999s)]
*  and Nigel Farage's more right-wing populist party ended up splitting so many of the votes [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=928.64s)]
*  that it enabled the Labour candidates to win with a very small percentage of votes. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=933.88s)]
*  The Conservatives got 24% of the overall vote total and only 18% of the seats in Parliament [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=937.76s)]
*  and then here's the really interesting thing, the Reform Party, which is Nigel Farage's [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=947.24s)]
*  party that led Brexit, that really represents his anti-establishment, hardcore right-wing [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=952.2s)]
*  politics, it got 14% of the overall vote total. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=956.96s)]
*  Again, a brand new party, it used to be called something different, it got abandoned, UKIP, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=960.4s)]
*  but it basically was a brand new party with no financing, no structure, no seats in the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=966.2800000000001s)]
*  Parliament, huge structural disadvantages, despite that it got 14% of the vote total [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=969.84s)]
*  and yet they only ended up getting 1% of the seats in the Parliament and then here you [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=976.88s)]
*  see the Liberal Democrats got 12 and 11%, the Greens got 7% of the vote total and yet [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=983.48s)]
*  1% in the Parliament. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=989.72s)]
*  So it's only because of the system that it makes it seem like the Labour Party had some [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=990.84s)]
*  major victory when in fact from the perspective of what the people think, they hate the Labour [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=994.72s)]
*  Party almost as much as any other establishment party. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1000.24s)]
*  Here just is another chart from the BBC, rather from Al Jazeera, you see their Labour Party [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1003.76s)]
*  got 35% of the vote, Conservative Party 24%, the Reform Party in third place with 14%. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1008.68s)]
*  So if you add together the centre-right party of the Conservative Party and the Reform Party, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1015.92s)]
*  you end up with 38% of the vote. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1021.3199999999999s)]
*  Now it's not really a fair way to look at it, there was also vote splits among the left, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1022.92s)]
*  but the idea that an establishment politics or centre-left politics had some grand resurgence [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1028.52s)]
*  is simply not the case, even the economist, a very vocal supporter these days of the Labour [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1035.72s)]
*  Party and a hardcore opponent of right-wing populism, was willing to admit that in an [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1043.0s)]
*  article this week, how shallow was Labour's victory in the British election, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1048.88s)]
*  Instead of inspiring the message, Sir Keir spearheaded a [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1073.0400000000002s)]
*  fearsomely efficient election-winning machine. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1076.88s)]
*  It won 42 seats in parliaments for every 1 million ballots cast, higher than any other [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1079.6000000000001s)]
*  major party in the past century. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1084.3200000000002s)]
*  It is true that Labour's victory was as much as the Conservatives defeat, the Conservative [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1087.5200000000002s)]
*  vote collapsed by 20 percentage points, the largest decline by any governing party in [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1091.44s)]
*  British political history. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1096.96s)]
*  Voters abandoned the party in all directions, not just for Labour, but for the Liberal Democrats, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1099.5200000000002s)]
*  Reform UK and the Green Party. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1104.0800000000002s)]
*  Reform UK, a Eurosceptic and anti-immigration party led by Nigel Farage, was the biggest [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1107.2800000000002s)]
*  beneficiary of the Conservative collapse in terms of vote share. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1112.72s)]
*  Reform UK achieved 14% of the vote nationwide, up by 12% compared with the Brexit party, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1116.0800000000002s)]
*  as Mr Farage's vehicle used to be known in 2019. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1123.0400000000002s)]
*  That was a greater share of the vote than the Lib Dems, though it translated into 67 [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  fewer seats than Sir Ed's party. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1131.92s)]
*  That's the real story of what happened in the UK election. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1135.04s)]
*  You could actually call it a victory for right-wing populism, for Eurosceptic right-wing [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1138.8s)]
*  populism, since that was the faction that had by far the greatest increase in votes despite [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1144.8s)]
*  major structural disadvantages. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1152.0s)]
*  Now they have four seats in the parliament, that party does. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1154.96s)]
*  Nigel Farage is going to be all over the media, and the probability that his party will continue [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1157.84s)]
*  to rise at the expense of not only the Conservatives, but also the Labour Party voters, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1162.72s)]
*  who they say they're targeting precisely because a lot of Labour Party voters also hate Brussels, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  the EU and massive uncontrolled immigration, they can continue to attract a large number [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1173.6000000000001s)]
*  of voters. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1179.68s)]
*  That really is the story of the election that exists and resides below the headline that [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1180.32s)]
*  Labour Party had some sort of grand resurgence and landslide victory. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1185.6000000000001s)]
*  France is a little bit different of a story, but more similar than different. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1190.4s)]
*  The reason for that is that the big question heading into the French elections was whether [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1198.0s)]
*  Marine Le Pen's party that most French and European establishment officials regard as a far-right or [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1203.84s)]

*  winning a majority of seats in the French parliament, have their first ever prime minister [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1216.64s)]
*  in power. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  Macron's view was every time Marine Le Pen or her party gets near power, the French voters come to [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1224.0s)]
*  me. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1230.24s)]
*  I'm convinced that after they see this victory that Marine Le Pen had, if I dissolve the parliament [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1232.0s)]
*  and hold new elections, the French electorate will come back to me, the person in the middle, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1236.0800000000002s)]
*  the establishment figure, they'll avoid the far left, they'll avoid the far right, and I [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1242.0800000000002s)]
*  will end up winning the election. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1246.4s)]
*  That is not what happened. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1248.96s)]
*  It is true that the far right of Marine Le Pen, if you want to call it that, that's how it's called, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1251.76s)]
*  ended up in third place, although they gained a lot more seats than they previously had. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1257.0400000000002s)]
*  But the winner of the French election by any metric was not the centrist establishment [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1263.44s)]
*  Macron policy, it was the coalition of left-wing parties who despise Macron and who have a much [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1269.6799999999998s)]
*  more anti-Brussels, anti-EU, populist politics than Macron does. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1279.4399999999998s)]
*  And here's a chart from The Economist that just shows the pure vote totals of the French [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1287.28s)]
*  National Assembly seats after the second round of voting which was held yesterday. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1292.32s)]
*  Here you see the new popular front, that's the coalition of left-wing parties, led by [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1297.04s)]
*  Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is absolutely a hardcore left-wing populist politician. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1302.32s)]
*  That faction got around 180 votes in the assembly. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  This is the ensemble party of Emmanuel Macron. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1315.6s)]
*  They got around 155, 160. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1318.6399999999999s)]
*  This Macron's faction lost a huge number of votes, not as many as... [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1321.44s)]
*  They looked like they were going to lose, but they lost a lot of votes. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1326.32s)]
*  They were the majority coalition. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1329.28s)]
*  And here's Marine Le Pen's National Rally Party that got just under 150 seats in the parliament. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1331.52s)]
*  And so what you really have is this massive division for the first time in the history of the [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1338.56s)]
*  fifth French Republic since World War II where they have this [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1346.0s)]
*  party that this inability to form a majority coalition in the French National Assembly that [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1349.6s)]
*  likely is paralyzing French politics for a long time. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1355.6799999999998s)]
*  But to me, again, the story here is that while Macron-centrist establishment politics have [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1358.32s)]
*  dominated French politics for at least the last eight years, this election resulted in a [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1363.9199999999998s)]
*  collapse of support for his faction and a rise in support for both the populist right and the [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1369.6799999999998s)]
*  populist left. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1375.36s)]
*  A very similar story to what we see in the UK and what we're seeing throughout all of the west. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1376.24s)]
*  Here's the Washington Post is kind of giving a couple of bottom line facts. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1381.92s)]
*  The Washington Post from today, a divided France enters uncharted political territory [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1386.88s)]
*  after historic vote. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1393.76s)]
*  Quote, even as left-wing supporters were still celebrating the unexpected defeat of France's [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1395.92s)]
*  far right at the polls, attention turned Monday to the sobering task of how to govern a deeply [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1400.96s)]
*  divided country as it moves into uncharted political territory. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1407.1200000000001s)]
*  While an alliance of leftist parties came in first with more than 180 seats, it is far from [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1411.44s)]
*  the 289 seats needed for majority in the National Assembly, the powerful lower house of parliament. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1415.92s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Together Coalition got more than 160 seats while the far [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1421.52s)]
*  right national rally and its allies were third, winning 143. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1427.1200000000001s)]
*  Polls had predicted that the far right would come in first and perhaps even win an outright [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1430.56s)]
*  majority. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1434.8s)]
*  Sunday's upset result could now prompt prolonged political gridlock and a quote, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1436.0s)]
*  new era in French politics. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1440.3200000000002s)]
*  Macron's Prime Minister, Gabrielle Attal said Sunday night, he actually is the protégé of Macron. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1442.48s)]
*  He was basically chosen by Macron to become the Prime Minister. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1450.8s)]
*  As I said, he's this young, gay, Macronist who Macron thought would easily be his successor. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1455.8400000000001s)]
*  And yet as a result of these election results, he resigned because he no longer has a majority in [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1462.72s)]
*  the assembly. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1466.3999999999999s)]
*  And yet quote, Macron on Monday rejected Attal's resignation, asking him to stay for quote, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1467.36s)]
*  the time being to quote, assure the stability of the country. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1472.0s)]
*  France's divided left formed a surprising alliance in the lead up to this election to prevent a far [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1474.96s)]
*  right victory and part of the coalition was also forged by deep frustration with Macron. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1479.28s)]
*  So again, it's a defeat for not the right wing party of Marine Le Pen who gained a lot of seats [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1484.56s)]
*  and just proved in the EU election that they have a lot more support than they ever had before. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1491.2s)]
*  It's also clearly a victory for these left wing populist parties. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1497.44s)]
*  It's a defeat for the centrist establishment politics of Manuel Crone, just as is the case [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1500.32s)]
*  in the UK. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1507.44s)]
*  Now, just to conclude, I want to show you a couple of segments from an interview that Marine Le Pen [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1508.64s)]
*  did last week with CNN's Christiane Amanpour because so often these parties are deliberately [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1516.88s)]
*  misunderstood in the United States, just like Trump's movement is often misunderstood because [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1523.92s)]
*  they're just labeled and smeared with this far right label, which is designed to imply [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1530.4s)]
*  that they want to round up minorities and put them in camps. That's what far right means in [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1536.8s)]
*  the history, in the context of European politics, in the context of US politics. It's designed to [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1541.6s)]
*  suggest they're sort of the successors ideologically of the Nazis, that they're far outside of the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1546.8s)]
*  realm of anything decent or mainstream. It's designed constantly to reinforce the idea that [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1552.1599999999999s)]
*  only establishment politics, not populist politics, is acceptable. And here's Marine Le Pen in her own [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1558.8s)]
*  words in this interview with Christiane Amanpour attempting to explain what it is that she actually [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1566.0s)]
*  believes and doesn't and seeing Christiane Amanpour's reaction to that. Let's go ahead and play this video. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1571.36s)]
*  Let me get to foreign affairs. You have in the past said things that cause people to worry about [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1585.6s)]
*  you regarding, for instance, Putin. You've talked about how, you know, Crimea, you said it to me, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1592.48s)]
*  was always Russian. You said the sanctions on Putin should be removed, those that were put on him for [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1599.2s)]
*  annexing Crimea and invading parts of Ukraine. Now he's fully invaded. Are you committed [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1606.72s)]
*  to the victory of Ukraine? Will France keep supporting Ukraine against this illegal invasion? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1614.32s)]
*  Do you call it an illegal invasion? And will France... Now just note there how it's amazing [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  that in order to prove that you're an acceptable politician in the West, the number one goal, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1630.64s)]
*  the number one task that you have is to pledge support to Ukraine. The first thing Keir Starmer [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1636.16s)]
*  did and he did it throughout the election was say no matter what, we are going to prove that we will [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1643.28s)]
*  stand by Ukraine until the end. When Georgia Maloney was elected prime minister of Italy, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1647.04s)]
*  they did the same thing to her that they did to Marine Le Pen. Called her a far-right fascist, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1653.1200000000001s)]
*  a protege of Mussolini, suggested that fascism was coming to Italy, that Italian democracy was [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1657.92s)]
*  threatened. And all she had to do was one thing in order to get the West to accept her, have the New [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1663.04s)]
*  York Times run flattering profiles on her and that was pledge her support for the native [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1670.16s)]
*  word Ukraine. And once she did that, all of those narratives disappeared. She's no longer talked [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1674.24s)]
*  about that way. And so here's Kristiana Mampour saying, you are connected to Putin. It seems like [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1679.76s)]
*  you have sympathy to Putin. And so we want to understand whether you are a decent person. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1685.8400000000001s)]
*  And the question that she has to answer to prove she's a decent person is will you support Ukraine [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1691.52s)]
*  against its war in Russia to the end? This is somehow the litmus test in Western politics for [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1697.04s)]
*  whether you are acceptable and decent company. And here was Marine Le Pen's answer. Call it an [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1703.2s)]
*  illegal invasion and will France continue to provide Ukraine with weapons to defend itself? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1708.32s)]
*  Madam, I think we can consider that the situation in Crimea was much more complicated than it is [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1715.52s)]
*  made out to be. But that has nothing to do with what Russia did now. What Russia has done here [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1721.44s)]
*  is violate Ukraine's territorial sovereignty, violate Ukraine's freedom and bring war to Ukraine. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1727.1200000000001s)]
*  From the outset, we have condemned Russia in this matter. And we have supported Ukraine throughout [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1734.96s)]
*  these two years, indicating that we have two red lines which were sending French troops to [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1742.56s)]
*  Ukrainian territory because the French are, I believe, totally opposed to this and the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1751.36s)]
*  delivery of long range weapons that could hit Russia and therefore make France a co-belligerent [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1758.8s)]
*  in this conflict. What do you think? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1766.24s)]
*  Final question. I mean, it is unbelievable that in order to be accepted in mainstream Western [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1769.28s)]
*  establishment political and media circles, you have to basically be indifferent to the risk of [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1779.84s)]
*  World War III. And if someone like Marine Le Pen says nothing other than which used to be the [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1784.24s)]
*  position of the US government until it abandoned it, that the two red lines we have is we will not [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1790.16s)]
*  deploy our own country's troops in Ukraine to fight against the Russian army nor will we [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1794.8s)]
*  authorize the use of long range missiles by the Ukrainians to attack Russia inside Russia because [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1800.24s)]
*  that will make our country a co-belligerent in the war. Those are the two limits that we have on [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1805.2s)]
*  our willingness to get involved. And that somehow, that extremely reasonable attempt to avoid World [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1812.56s)]
*  War III and the risk of nuclear war that go with it is regarded as evidence of fascism or fanaticism [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1819.04s)]
*  or right-wing extremism. It's just the thing that dominates all of Western politics somehow now, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1825.76s)]
*  is pledging support for the war in Ukraine and the NATO war that seems to be an endless war. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1833.6s)]
*  All right, let's look at one last question that she asked because I think it's so [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1837.2s)]
*  illustrative of how this discourse is so distorted. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1842.56s)]
*  In this conflict, the fact that your party did so well in the European elections and so did [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1846.8s)]
*  Georgia Maloney's party and so did AFD, I mean you know AFD as you know a little bit like the [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1855.36s)]
*  former national front is very scary. The fact that the far right is becoming a very very powerful [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1861.12s)]
*  force in Europe and who knows maybe now with all that's going on in the United States, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1869.04s)]
*  Donald Trump might win a second term. How do you see Europe changing? First of all, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1873.44s)]
*  I strongly dispute the term far right which in your country refers to small groups that are [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1881.52s)]
*  extremely radical and violent. If you like the equivalent, you don't think you're far right. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1886.64s)]
*  The equivalent of what we are in the United States is between the center right and the center left [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1893.28s)]
*  with regards to ideas. So I think this... You're kidding me, right? Yes. What kind of comment is [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1900.96s)]
*  that for a journalist? Oh you're kidding me, right? With her hands folded and her just smarmy [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1907.52s)]
*  expression on her face. This is designed to say that we have put you in this category called far [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1914.08s)]
*  right and I don't even have to make an argument as to why you belong there. In fact, any attempt by [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1919.52s)]
*  you to say we're not actually in this extremist category is just going to provoke this kind of [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1926.48s)]
*  scoffing for me because I know that's all I need to tell my audience that you're crazy and what [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1931.84s)]
*  you're saying. This is such a bizarre way to conduct an interview with this person that you've [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1936.24s)]
*  asked a question to explain your position and you interrupt and do nothing other than say you're [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1941.1200000000001s)]
*  kidding me, right? Because you know that the CNN audience already has been convinced that Marine [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1945.3600000000001s)]
*  Le Pen deserves this title far right. Listen to the rest of this. Yes, I'm telling you very honestly, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1950.24s)]
*  I think this use of the term far right carries a stigma and is very pejorative. It does not [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1956.24s)]
*  correspond to what we are and not at all to what the far right is in the United States. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1963.76s)]
*  That's the first thing to say. Secondly, we can't put everyone in the same boat. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1969.36s)]
*  For example, in Europe, we distanced ourselves from the AFD party because we're in total [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1973.9199999999998s)]
*  disagreement with a number of their statements. So together with Mrs. Maloney and with our [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1980.0s)]
*  differences too are what we call patriots. In other words, we defend the existence and the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1988.0s)]
*  power of nations within the European Union because nations are the expression of the French people. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=1995.36s)]
*  So when the European Union takes on certain roles without consulting anyone, it is no longer [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2003.44s)]
*  democratic. We are defenders of nations. We want a Europe of nations, a Europe that respects the [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2014.24s)]
*  decisions of the people and not a super technocratic structure such as it exists today. And that's the [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2020.72s)]
*  path that we want to follow. A Europe of nations that's respectful, that leads projects, a Europe [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2027.36s)]
*  that doesn't restrict, that doesn't threaten, that doesn't blackmail when it comes to subsidies [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2033.6s)]
*  because that's not our vision. Our Europe is the Europe of Airbus. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2039.52s)]
*  Forgive me, it's a competitor. It's the Europe of Ariane. It's not the Europe of Madame Vandelaine, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2045.6s)]
*  and so we will fight within Europe to redirect Europe in the direction that we want. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2052.4s)]
*  Now the reason why I think that exchange is so telling is because to me this really does define [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2058.08s)]
*  modern day politics. I think the president of the EU, this unelected technocrat, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2062.08s)]
*  Ursula Vandelaine, is the embodiment of establishment politics. You can find other [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2070.48s)]
*  people like at Davos and other places, but to me she is the kind of living, breathing embodiment [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2075.92s)]
*  of what establishment politics is. There's no democratic electability to her. She has no support [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2082.96s)]
*  within the people of the countries that form the EU, only within the elite halls in Paris and Berlin [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2089.52s)]
*  and other European capitals. And her politics is one of allegiance to the neoliberalism of [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  the international order to massive international institutions that are far removed from anything [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2104.32s)]
*  that the people who are ruled by them believe in or have any say in. It's why the UK left the EU [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2112.4s)]
*  because they didn't want to be governed by these distant, unelected technocrats in Brussels. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  And if you look at the requirements of what is deemed to be necessary to be an establishment [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2124.48s)]
*  politician, support for the NATO war, allegiance to the superstructures like the World Bank and the [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2130.3199999999997s)]
*  IMF and the EU and all of these conglomerates of concentrated power that have a very establishment [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2137.12s)]
*  ideology, of course those factions have succeeded in saying anyone who descends from our ideology, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2146.0s)]
*  anyone who declares their independence from our control and power, we're going to deem a far right [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2153.68s)]
*  or far left radical. And that's why you had Jeremy Corbyn in the EU who, although he abandoned it [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2158.56s)]
*  when he was the leader of the Labour Party, clearly had a history of favoring Brexit and was very [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2166.72s)]
*  tepid in his support for staying in Brexit, which he had to do as the leader of the Labour Party. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2171.7599999999998s)]
*  But left-wing politics in the EU, including in France, is very hostile to Brussels and so is [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2176.96s)]
*  are these populist parties, these nationalist parties on the right, who are saying we want to [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2182.16s)]
*  govern ourselves as France, not as under the rule of Ursula von der Leyen and the other unelected [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2185.84s)]
*  officials in Brussels. And you can find that on the left and the right in Europe, you can find that [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2192.56s)]
*  on the left and the right in the United States, and that's so clearly part of the reason why I [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2198.4s)]
*  believe that our modern-day politics is not really well defined by left versus right or conservative [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2203.1200000000003s)]
*  versus liberal in any of these traditional senses, but far more by whether you pledge allegiance to [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2208.96s)]
*  and believe in the dominant ideology of establishment factions or whether you oppose them. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2214.8s)]
*  And I think what all of these elections are showing is that more and more people are [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2219.84s)]
*  disgusted by that establishment ideology, don't believe these establishment factions have their [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2223.92s)]
*  best interests at heart. A lot of them just respond by removing themselves from the political system [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2227.52s)]
*  altogether and not voting. But when there are elections, what you see, again, sometimes more [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2233.28s)]
*  gradually, sometimes more abruptly, depending on the election, is a constantly and rapidly growing [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2240.96s)]
*  contempt for this establishment ideology that Cristina Almanpour is there defending and trying [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2246.48s)]
*  to label Marine Le Pen as a far-right extremist because of her refusal to accept it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNBCFh7cIzo&t=2251.76s)]
