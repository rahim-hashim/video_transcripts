# TikTok "Refugees" Flee To Chinese RedNote App: Arnaud Bertrand Reacts
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ)
*  All right, let me move to the issue of TikTok because it's really fascinating. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=0.0s)]
*  There was a time when the ban was first proposed under the Trump administration in 2020 when [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=15.48s)]
*  it was all about fear mongering over China and we have to protect ourselves from the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=22.36s)]
*  evil Chinese trying to corrupt the minds of our youth and spy on us and it just it didn't [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=26.56s)]
*  go anywhere and I don't know if you heard my saying before you came on that we're really [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  put it over the edge and even the leading advocates of the TikTok ban admit this is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=35.48s)]
*  that the perception arose not about China but that there was too much anti-Israel content [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=42.72s)]
*  being allowed on TikTok, too much pro-Palestinian content, too much imagery about what was being [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=48.22s)]
*  done in Gaza and that turned American youth against Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  That's what really enabled the momentum to pick up to ban TikTok but now as it's about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=55.12s)]
*  to be banned, as it's about to be actually closed and 170 million Americans are about [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=61.8s)]
*  to lose it, everyone in Washington is a little bit freaked out because they realize that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=65.24s)]
*  this is just a cataclysmic act of repression and disruption and they're finding ways to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  try and get out of that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=77.64s)]
*  What has been the view of all of this in China because you know Americans are often told [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=79.38s)]
*  that one of the things that makes China repressive is they close Google or they put restrictions [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=84.88s)]
*  on Facebook and YouTube because they don't want an open internet and here you see the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=89.92s)]
*  US now shutting down, trying to shut down a major app. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=93.96s)]
*  What has been the perception in China about all this? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=97.52s)]
*  So I think most people are amused especially of the TikTok refugee phenomenon on Shantou. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=102.88s)]
*  It's important to remind that what America is doing with TikTok is quite a bit different [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=114.56s)]
*  from what China did with Facebook on Twitter for instance because at heart what happened [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=122.4s)]
*  in China, the Facebook and Twitter thing is that China is famously very strict rules around [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=133.28s)]
*  content, content moderation and on data. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=141.8s)]
*  So if you're a social media platform you need to censor content according to the guidelines [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=146.88s)]
*  and you need to keep all your users' data in China, in the country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=155.16s)]
*  And what happened is simply that Facebook on Twitter and all the social media, American [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=162.04s)]
*  social media that are not in China anymore refused to do that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=169.68s)]
*  Some accepted that like LinkedIn for instance and they're still in China. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=177.4s)]
*  So there is an opportunity for American social media firms to stay in China if they abide [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=184.4s)]
*  by China's rules. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  Censorship rules. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=194.28s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=195.28s)]
*  Not only censorship but also... [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=198.16s)]
*  And data retention. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=199.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=201.44s)]
*  But TikTok is quite a bit different because TikTok themselves have said put some rules. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=204.44s)]
*  We're more than happy to keep all the data in servers in the US. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=210.16s)]
*  We're more than happy to abide by any content moderation rules and so on. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=216.96s)]
*  But no, even if they were to have those rules and respect them, the ban will still go forward [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=224.16s)]
*  because the app is Chinese. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=232.32s)]
*  So there is nothing they can do effectively. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=234.8s)]
*  It's discriminatory. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=239.44s)]
*  So it's quite a different situation I would say. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=242.56s)]
*  That's what people in China generally point out is that it's unfair and discriminatory [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=247.44s)]
*  towards China, Chinese companies in a way that China doesn't act. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=253.68s)]
*  They have some rules. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=262.16s)]
*  You can criticize them but they're the same for everyone. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=263.92s)]
*  Chinese social media platforms also have to respect them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=267.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting point because we've actually done reporting before on how TikTok [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=270.64s)]
*  desperate to stay in the United States because of how profitable it is for them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=275.64s)]
*  And they're at the end of the day, they're really just a for-profit company wanting to make money. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=279.48s)]
*  They're not really an arm of trying to corrupt the American youth for this Chinese Communist Party. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=282.92s)]
*  But they offered every one of those concessions, as you said. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=288.2s)]
*  In fact, they hired huge numbers of former CIA and FBI and NSA officials away from Facebook, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=290.68s)]
*  away from Google to do their content moderation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=297.32s)]
*  We once had a video critical of US and NATO policy in Ukraine banned by TikTok showing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=300.36s)]
*  that they were censoring to accommodate the US government in a way that even other platforms [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=308.12s)]
*  weren't. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=313.08s)]
*  That was the only platform where we had that video removed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=314.08s)]
*  And I think you're right that at the end of the day, it's really just about we don't care [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  if you abide by our rules. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=320.88s)]
*  We don't even care if you censor the way we want. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=322.0s)]
*  We just don't want anything to do with China here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=323.56s)]
*  One of the things though that has happened is you add, you mentioned this, this migration [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  of all these TikTok creators afraid that TikTok was going to get shut down and trying [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=329.6s)]
*  to kind of build a new home for themselves on social media purposely using this Chinese [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  app Red Note. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  You referenced the Chinese name. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  I'll leave that to you so I don't butcher it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=343.68s)]
*  But one of the things that I've read that I've seen reports suggesting is that the Chinese [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  government is now starting to worry because there's a lot of interaction between young [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  American content creators on TikTok and young Chinese creators on TikTok and that this could [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=355.96s)]
*  end up circumventing some of these censorship rules by having American creators disseminate [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=362.0s)]
*  a bunch of ideas and views and experiences and thoughts that the Chinese government wants [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=366.84s)]
*  its citizens to be shielded from. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=371.96s)]
*  Is that a valid concern? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=374.12s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  I think the Chinese government is probably worried. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that's correct because it is quite something. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=387.36s)]
*  It's the first time that there is a large scale direct social interaction between Western [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=393.36s)]
*  and Chinese users on social media. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  And so I think that they're wondering what that will lead to. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  I think it's more of a wait and see approach to see if there aren't some unintended consequences [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=412.64s)]
*  or bad consequences for China arising out of that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  So I don't think that there will be an immediate move. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  I think what can be more expected is a wait and see, patience and then share on red nodes, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=432.92s)]
*  bit by bit adapting to this new status quo. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  And also it's important to note that it's also not from a user standpoint, it's also [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=451.0s)]
*  a bit awkward because obviously most Americans don't speak Chinese. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=458.36s)]
*  Most of those new users don't. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=464.92s)]
*  Many Chinese don't speak English. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=468.2s)]
*  And so even just if you go to share Hongshu today, it's a bit weird. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  You have like half the posts in Chinese, half the posts in English. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=475.64s)]
*  And so from a user standpoint, it's a bit of a weird experience. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=479.32s)]
*  So I think it's fair to assume that there will be more and more separation between those languages. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=483.52s)]
*  So if you are American, if you only speak English, then you're going to see only English posts and vice versa. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think naturally, just even from a user experience standpoint, it's fair to expect [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  more and more separation between both user groups simply because they speak different [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=509.84s)]
*  language and they also have different cultures and interests and so on and so forth. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=516.0s)]
*  But I think that probably China is also going to conclude that it's obviously very much [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=523.2s)]
*  a win for them to have yet another social media platform that's very popular among Americans. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=531.28s)]
*  So it would be shooting themselves in the foot if they did some policy to antagonize that new user base. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=543.68s)]
*  It would be the funniest thing ever really if the US government, both parties, ends up [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  driving Americans from a platform that I guess you could say is associated with the Chinese [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=558.0s)]
*  into an actual Chinese social media platform that is built for the Chinese people. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=564.16s)]
*  I do though, I saw a lot of videos over the last week though circulating that were very interesting [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=571.92s)]
*  where having grown up in the United States, I know this very well, that when there's a country that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=576.48s)]
*  the United States government wants to demonize, anyone knows in the United States is this [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=581.52s)]
*  caricature of that country and therefore of its people. It was always amazing during the Cold War [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=588.24s)]
*  there was this pro-peace music where they would say things like Russians love their children too [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=593.28s)]
*  and it was considered profound as though that had never been thought of that way before. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=598.24s)]
*  Because that is a really important way that the American government propagandizes citizens to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=603.6s)]
*  believe that these people in these other countries are just basically not really human. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=608.4s)]
*  So when you see interaction between Chinese young people and American young people and the Americans [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  are saying, oh my god I can't believe how culturally connected they are, how happy they seem, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  the stuff they're saying about their lives is so at odds with the things that we were told to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=625.68s)]
*  believe about them. It does seem like a major benefit maybe not for the Chinese government or [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  for the American government but just for the world. Do you see that as promising that way? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7cxawM2TQ&t=635.44s)]
