# Biden's Approval Ratings Reach Record Low After Trump Verdict; Media Denies Election Year Realities
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M)
*  One of the things that you would have thought the 2016 election demonstrated or proved [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=0.0s)]
*  to the corporate media or at least prompted a lot of self-reflection was just how completely [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=13.52s)]
*  removed and out of touch and separate they are from the ordinary voter. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=20.32s)]
*  The entire media essentially was united in support of Hillary Clinton's campaign and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=25.2s)]
*  against Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=29.88s)]
*  They did everything possible to sabotage that campaign including drowning the country and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=32.04s)]
*  yet another disinformation campaign, not the laptop disinformation campaign that was 2020 [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=37.4s)]
*  but the Russiagate disinformation campaign that came from the FBI and the CIA in an attempt [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=42.76s)]
*  to sabotage Donald Trump's candidacy that they really did fear because of the ideology [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=47.68s)]
*  and views and policies he was advocating. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=52.3s)]
*  All throughout the year they were insisting to Americans that there had never been a candidate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=56.78s)]
*  as dangerous as Donald Trump and they were absolutely certain, every newsroom was, that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  Hillary Clinton was not only going to be the winner of that election but win by a very [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=68.5s)]
*  comfortable margin. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=71.9s)]
*  None of that happened. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=74.3s)]
*  The media obviously had very different priorities than people who are ensconced in studios in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=77.26s)]
*  Washington and New York working with very large contracts from major media corporations. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=83.26s)]
*  Surprise surprise, people who are far less economically well off or who live in different [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=88.94s)]
*  places or have different values don't actually feel represented by the media that say 50 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=93.34s)]
*  or 60 years ago they felt very represented by that actually made an effort to support [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  all sectors of American life. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=104.74s)]
*  That's no longer the case, everything is segregated. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=106.98s)]
*  Liberal outlets which are most in the corporate media know that they're speaking only to liberals, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=110.58s)]
*  that's their business model, it's their political activist model and so when they drone on and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=114.7s)]
*  on and on they're mostly speaking to people who already are on their side and it changes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=119.38s)]
*  nothing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=123.02s)]
*  Here we are in 2024 and I don't need to tell you everything that the media has been saying [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=124.02s)]
*  and doing in order to convince Americans yet again that Donald Trump is not just a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=131.08s)]
*  bad president but basically a Hitlerian figure, a major threat to American democracy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=136.0s)]
*  It's something we hear over and over and over. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  As I mentioned they were quite certain that convicting Donald Trump on any felony no matter [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=145.12s)]
*  what it was would basically sabotage and doom his candidacy and at the same time ensure [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden's reelection. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=156.96s)]
*  And yet lo and behold from FiveThirtyEight which is the site that Nate Silver founded [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=158.92s)]
*  that analyzes and aggregates polling data, here you see that Joe Biden's approval rating [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=165.04s)]
*  is currently at its lowest ever rate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Here you can see on the screen this green line represents his approval rating, it is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=176.88s)]
*  going down and here's the disapproval rating that is going up. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=183.68s)]
*  This is from February 2023 all throughout 2023 and into 2024 so that his disapproval [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=189.08s)]
*  rating is now 56.6% while his approval rating is 37.6% and this comes in the wake of an [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=196.04s)]
*  onslaught by the corporate media to glorify Joe Biden's presidency, to convince Americans [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  that their belief that they're struggling economically is misplaced and baseless. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=212.18s)]
*  I cannot tell you how many times I have heard or seen journalists who work for cable outlets [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=218.46s)]
*  or other major media corporations who have multi-million dollar contracts as their salary [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=225.34s)]
*  for every year, who have large homes in which they live paid off along with their summer [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=232.18s)]
*  in the Hamptons or in Georgetown where they live and then in Martha's Vineyard. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=238.7s)]
*  Tell everybody the economy is doing very, very well and you Americans out there who [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  think that you're economically struggling don't understand the data and you should actually [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  not be angry at Joe Biden, you should be grateful towards him because of how good your lives [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=256.06s)]
*  and then they're shocked when Joe Biden's approval ratings continue to plummet and it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=263.06s)]
*  really is a reflection not only of how little in common they have with the people who they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=268.94s)]
*  think they're electing and directing and leading but also just how incapable they are of understanding [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=273.38s)]
*  the priorities of American voters because they're completely different from these media [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=281.79999999999995s)]
*  figures for obvious reasons that if you're very wealthy, if you're making a lot of money, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=286.06s)]
*  your concern for the economy is much less, your belief that the economy is doing very [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=291.02s)]
*  well is much higher because the economy actually is doing well for you which doesn't mean it's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=295.29999999999995s)]
*  doing well for everybody else. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=300.97999999999996s)]
*  Now the other aspect obviously and we've seen this in polling data over and over and over [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=304.41999999999996s)]
*  and over is that one of the main reasons the American public does not trust Joe Biden, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  does not want to vote for him for a second term is the obviously well-grounded belief [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=315.18s)]
*  that Biden who is now 81, already the oldest American president ever to serve in that office [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=322.18s)]
*  81, who is trying to run for a second term which will bring him to the age of 85 at the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=329.18s)]
*  end of that term, everyone can see in plain sight that he is rapidly deteriorating cognitively [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=334.26s)]
*  and in every other way as a result of age. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=343.14s)]
*  And one of the reasons why American voters are so impervious to being gaslit and told [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=346.76s)]
*  that what they're seeing is not the truth is because this is one of the areas in which [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  Americans have a lot of confidence in their own ability to judge, they don't need experts [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=357.53999999999996s)]
*  to help guide them through that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=362.4s)]
*  That's because most of us have had the experience, I know I have, most people I know have, of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=363.7s)]
*  having loved ones or family members who get very old into their 80s and 90s deteriorate [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=370.92s)]
*  in every way, cognitively, physically, and we recognize it, we don't need journalists [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  to tell us whether it's true, we can see it for ourselves. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=381.94000000000005s)]
*  Just that video clip I showed you from Biden in 1991, he's a completely different individual [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=386.56s)]
*  than what you hear now. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=392.92s)]
*  And yet I want to show you just a clip that I found so amazing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  There was recently a Wall Street Journal article that was headlined, Behind Closed Doors, Biden [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=400.02000000000004s)]
*  Shows Signs of Slipping. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=404.86s)]
*  And it quoted a lot of Democrats, although none of them, because they're cowards, would [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=408.8s)]
*  go on the record, talking about how in meetings it's actually embarrassing. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=412.5s)]
*  He like sometimes rambles and no one has any idea what he's saying. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  They're talking about matters of war and peace or economic policy or the debt ceiling or [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=421.66s)]
*  agreements and he just starts rambling in this very soft voice that almost nobody can [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=426.3s)]
*  hear. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=431.3s)]
*  Half the time he's reading from note cards that are the most basic and elementary points [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=432.3s)]
*  that everybody already understands and agree with and that has nothing to do with the negotiation [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=437.62s)]
*  and for a long period of time he'll just close his eyes and check out. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=441.14s)]
*  Or when it's time for him to speak, they'll just be dead silence for 30 seconds and even [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=445.7s)]
*  Democrats are saying how uncomfortable it is, how visible it is, and we're all seeing [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  the same thing in public. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=453.82s)]
*  Even the White House has been trying to say, oh, don't worry, in private he's this very [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=457.14000000000004s)]
*  sharp robust leader, even if you don't see it in public. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=460.86s)]
*  So the Wall Street Journal was deeply reported, but the only ones who would go on record were [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=464.22s)]
*  Republicans even though a lot of Democrats were saying the same thing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=469.14000000000004s)]
*  Here is how Joe Scarborough, who let's remember was a Republican his entire life. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  He was elected to Congress in 1994 as part of the anti-establishment conservative backlash [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=478.62s)]
*  led by Newt Gingrich. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=485.7s)]
*  He was one of those congressmen. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=486.7s)]
*  And now he has a multi-million dollar contract with MSNBC and he knows that to keep that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=489.18s)]
*  he has to essentially engage in anti-Trump propaganda every day, which he does. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=492.7s)]
*  But here is he, Joe Scarborough, trying to convince people that not only is Joe Biden [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=497.85999999999996s)]
*  not suffering cognitive decline, that he is essentially sharper and more analytically [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=504.14s)]
*  sophisticated and more tuned in to complex issues of economic and foreign policy than [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=509.21999999999997s)]
*  almost anybody else in Washington. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=514.4000000000001s)]
*  Just listen to this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=516.2800000000001s)]
*  With House Republicans to lift the debt ceiling, his demeanor and command of the details seemed [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=517.2800000000001s)]
*  to shift from one day to the next, according to then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=523.72s)]
*  They also quoted Mike Johnson, people around Mike Johnson, and admit that this was basically [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=529.36s)]
*  House Republicans whacking. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Why didn't they just ask Marjorie Taylor Greene? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=538.8800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=541.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they could have. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=542.04s)]
*  And Lauren Boebert. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=543.04s)]
*  It's really shocking, especially when you see what Kevin McCarthy has said repeatedly, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=544.04s)]
*  publicly and behind the scenes about Biden on those same days when they were negotiating. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=549.48s)]
*  The strong feelings you're seeing about this article comes also because the context of [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=556.56s)]
*  this race and these two candidates, it's interesting. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=561.4s)]
*  That's all I'll say. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  Anyhow, that flies in the face of what McCarthy said about Biden's effectiveness in the past. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=565.8399999999999s)]
*  John Politico last year, quote, McCarthy mocked Biden's age and mental acuity in public. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=571.24s)]
*  In public, like he did in this article. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=577.6s)]
*  While privately telling allies that he found the president sharp and substantive in their [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=580.64s)]
*  conversations, a contradiction that left a deep impression on the White House. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=585.84s)]
*  This from the New York Times. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=591.24s)]
*  Privately, Mr. McCarthy has told allies that he has found Mr. Biden to be mentally sharp. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=593.0s)]
*  Joe Scarborough went on a five-minute rant about how he has known House speakers, met [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=599.16s)]
*  with House speakers over 30 years, and that Joe Biden puts, the current Joe Biden puts [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=608.48s)]
*  every one of them to shame, including Kevin McCarthy, when it comes to his mental acuity, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=614.6s)]
*  his ability to understand and make strong reasoned decisions on complex... [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=620.52s)]
*  This is North Korea level style propaganda. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=626.32s)]
*  This is the sort of thing that anybody with a minimal amount of shame would refuse to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=635.8000000000001s)]
*  But these partisan outlets have none of that shame. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=637.4000000000001s)]
*  They're counting on trying to tell American people, the American people, that what they're [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=641.36s)]
*  seeing they should not believe. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=646.6400000000001s)]
*  They should not trust their own lying eyes. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=648.12s)]
*  That is the only strategy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=650.24s)]
*  Every day you see new images of Biden shuffling, that kind of very slow shuffle. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  This is very lethargic, representing just a complete kind of gradual shutdown of the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=658.88s)]
*  human organism, of the body, which obviously includes the brain as well. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=666.76s)]
*  You can see him half the time, having no idea where he is, no idea where he's supposed to [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=670.88s)]
*  go, looking extremely confused. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=674.5999999999999s)]
*  And yet, Democrats, wealthy, out of touch Democrats, really believe that what people [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=679.92s)]
*  are going to vote on are things like Trump's conviction in the Manhattan courtroom and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=687.12s)]
*  what they probably perceive to be nothing more than a private matter of infidelity, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=691.36s)]
*  something that during the Clinton years they proved they really don't care about. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=699.0s)]
*  What they want in their political leaders are people who are going to make their lives [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=702.24s)]
*  materially better. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=705.9599999999999s)]
*  They have a positive recollection of the Trump economy before COVID, and they feel they're [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=707.72s)]
*  economically struggling under Biden. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  And yet the kind of people who are leading Democrats and telling them what it is that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=715.08s)]
*  they should say are people like Alexander Soros. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=720.44s)]
*  Now if you can find, let's put this tweet up on the screen, if you can find a person [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=725.48s)]
*  who has less in common with almost every other American, let alone ordinary American, average [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=732.48s)]
*  Americans and swing states than Alexander Soros, I'd like to find out who that is. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=738.52s)]
*  He was not only born into multi-multi-billionaire wealth that he did not earn though inherited, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=744.36s)]
*  but every single thing that Alexander Soros has done in his life, everything that he is, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=752.26s)]
*  is the sheer byproduct, the exclusive byproduct of genetic luck, of having been born to somebody [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=758.54s)]
*  who actually compiled a massive fortune regardless of how they did that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=765.8199999999999s)]
*  And Alexander Soros didn't try and go into another field to prove that he was capable, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=770.48s)]
*  he just followed his father around and how he inherited the open society foundation that [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=774.88s)]
*  his father runs and the way that he exercises political control with billions of dollars. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=780.66s)]
*  Even that alone, imagine the open society is a big foundation with huge numbers of employees. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  You think George Soros' son just happens to be the best person, the most competent person [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=793.66s)]
*  to run it? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=798.4s)]
*  Everyone knows Alexander Soros is only relevant and important because he got billions and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=800.1199999999999s)]
*  billions of dollars that he did not earn from his daddy. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=803.9599999999999s)]
*  He's somebody whose entire identity, entire life comes not from any of his accomplishments [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=807.3199999999999s)]
*  but purely his father's. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=813.1199999999999s)]
*  And you would think that would bestow somebody with a sense of shame or at least humility, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=816.88s)]
*  like maybe I don't actually understand how the majority of American voters reason and [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=822.46s)]
*  what's important to them and what they're going through because I was born into unimaginable [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=829.9399999999999s)]
*  billionaire wealth that I've now inherited. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=836.06s)]
*  But apparently people like him have no shame. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=839.9399999999999s)]
*  In fact, what ends up happening is that because of how I'm sure everyone around Alexander [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  Soros has treated him since birth, how elites treat him knowing that he has more money than [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=848.9599999999999s)]
*  almost anybody. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=855.4s)]
*  George Soros uses more money in the political system to influence the political system than [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=856.4s)]
*  anybody. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=861.04s)]
*  So you can imagine how the doors swing open for Alexander Soros and how they always have [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=862.04s)]
*  And somehow that has convinced him not that he is a byproduct of luck and unearned success [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=867.54s)]
*  but that he somehow has been endowed with great wisdom as reflected by the power that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=876.9s)]
*  he has amassed. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=881.6999999999999s)]
*  And here he is issuing instructions to the Democratic Party and every day he's posting [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=883.8199999999999s)]
*  pictures of him with Hillary Clinton, with Joe Biden, with Nancy Pelosi. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=889.84s)]
*  He's always with them, donating money, having fundraisers. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=895.14s)]
*  And here he is telling them what Democrats should do to win the election. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=898.84s)]
*  This is what he, the decree he issued on May 31st, quote, Democrats should refer to Trump [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=901.88s)]
*  as a convicted felon at every opportunity. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=906.84s)]
*  Repetition is the key to a successful message, which is an odd thing to say since that was [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=911.08s)]
*  Joseph Goebbels' major insight that if you just repeat something long enough and enough [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=916.1999999999999s)]
*  times the public will believe it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=922.2s)]
*  And then he goes on to say, and we want people to wrestle with the notion of hiring a convicted [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=924.64s)]
*  felon for the most important job in the country. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=929.26s)]
*  Now if you're Alexander Soros and you're drowning in billions of dollars of wealth and you have [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=931.9s)]
*  access to every single elite sector, maybe the things that you think are the top concerns [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=939.02s)]
*  for voters are not really the top concerns for voters. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=944.02s)]
*  Maybe believing that Trump's conviction in the Manhattan trial in a case involving a [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=948.38s)]
*  porn star and hush payments might not be the most important thing to Americans who weren't [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=954.7s)]
*  born into billions of dollars of wealth and yet this is how they constantly reason. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=960.26s)]
*  That's the way in which these media people are so out of touch with the public who they [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=966.82s)]
*  think they're lecturing into and directing. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=970.48s)]
*  Now here's actual empirical data, polling data, after the Trump conviction that shows [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=972.46s)]
*  what Americans' priorities actually are. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=980.7800000000001s)]
*  From CBS News on June 9th, quote, Trump and Biden neck and neck nationally and then battlegrounds, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=983.98s)]
*  which is more or less what we've seen. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=988.46s)]
*  We've seen Trump with a lead but within the margin of error throughout the last several [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=990.5400000000001s)]
*  months in battleground states. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=994.38s)]
*  And CBS says this, quote, among all the factors on voters minds this election, among all the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=996.46s)]
*  factors on voters minds this election, former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict pales [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1003.5s)]
*  in comparison, pales in comparison to issues like the economy, inflation, and the border, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1010.02s)]
*  all items on which Trump maintains advantages. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1023.18s)]
*  As such, the verdict has not dramatically reshaped the race. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1027.94s)]
*  Now again, if you are a very wealthy liberal and media lead or let alone Alexander Soros, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1032.1s)]
*  none of these issues matter to you. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1038.8999999999999s)]
*  You don't care about inflation. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1040.1799999999998s)]
*  You don't even notice inflation. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1041.1799999999998s)]
*  Let's go back to that graphic, please. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1042.3799999999999s)]
*  Actually you can see it here. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1046.1s)]
*  The first issue that Americans are concerned about, the major factor, is the economy. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1048.94s)]
*  There you see it at 81%. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1054.74s)]
*  Inflation 75%. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1057.8600000000001s)]
*  State of democracy 74%. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1059.98s)]
*  Crime 62%. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1062.98s)]
*  The US Mexico border 56%. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1064.94s)]
*  Gun policy 52%. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1067.8600000000001s)]
*  And then here at the very end is Trump's conviction only 28%. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1071.46s)]
*  Look at the enormous disparity between that and all those other issues that have actually [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1077.54s)]
*  affected people's lives. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1081.8999999999999s)]
*  I'll guarantee you that the 28% who even said they cared that much were overwhelmingly [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1083.22s)]
*  democratic voters who would never vote for Trump in any event, but whose media keep telling [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1089.22s)]
*  them that's such an important issue. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1093.34s)]
*  Now again, if you're a wealthy liberal elite on the coast, of course you don't think these [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1096.82s)]
*  issues matter. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1102.1s)]
*  The economy is doing great for you. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1104.1399999999999s)]
*  You don't notice inflation because you're so rich. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1105.88s)]
*  You live in neighborhoods where crime doesn't really happen. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1109.1200000000001s)]
*  Can we go back to that graph, please? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1111.8400000000001s)]
*  The US Mexico border, you send your kids to private schools. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1115.0s)]
*  You live in the kind of communities where you don't have to deal with assimilating immigrants. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1118.42s)]
*  So you can focus on these kind of ethereal issues like these abstract dangers Trump poses [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1124.48s)]
*  because of his conviction. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1129.5200000000002s)]
*  And this gap between elite political and media sectors on the one hand and the entire rest [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1133.04s)]
*  of the country on the other can't really be understated in terms of its importance. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1140.08s)]
*  Historically, it's kind of like the Versailles model when you have the elite completely clustered [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1147.24s)]
*  in certain exclusive places that have nothing in common with the lives of all the other [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1153.66s)]
*  whom they think they have a right to rule. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1160.36s)]
*  You get extreme levels of hatred, justifiable hatred from the ordinary people towards these [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  elites. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1169.3999999999999s)]
*  We covered last night the EU elections. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1170.7199999999998s)]
*  That was the major driving force. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1172.4599999999998s)]
*  It's been the major driving force of anti-establishment sentiment all throughout the West since 2016 [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1174.04s)]
*  with Brexit and Trump and even before that and certainly since. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1179.4799999999998s)]
*  The more the elite class sees that ordinary Americans, ordinary citizens are disobeying [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQPQTOKC35M&t=1184.8s)]
