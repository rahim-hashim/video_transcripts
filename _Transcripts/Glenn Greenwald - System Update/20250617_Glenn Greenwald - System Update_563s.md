# Trump's Unhinged Warning: EVACUATE TEHRAN
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs)
*  If you're an American citizen as an adult, you have seen the United States repeatedly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=0.0s)]
*  go to war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=10.48s)]
*  Anyone 18 or over has seen the United States involved in all sorts of war and that's after [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=11.48s)]
*  the Iraq war, which is now 22 years ago. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=17.52s)]
*  Essentially, if you're American, it means forever, for a long, long time, for many decades, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=20.56s)]
*  that you are a citizen of a country that's always at war. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=26.04s)]
*  And after World War II, there's a very visible and clear pattern, which is that the US government [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=29.98s)]
*  convinces its citizens, enough of them, to support the war at the beginning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=35.66s)]
*  They deluge them with war propaganda, which is extremely strong, primal, tribal, and enough [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=39.74s)]
*  Americans initially support the war to let the US government politically go and drop [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=48.94s)]
*  bombs or finance some other country to go drop bombs for it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  And then after six months or a year or two years or four years, polls show that Americans [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=57.86s)]
*  overwhelmingly oppose that war that they were convinced in the beginning to support. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Going back to the war in Vietnam, all throughout the 1980s, wars in the war on terror in Afghanistan [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=68.66s)]
*  and Iraq and Syria and Libya, the financing of the war in Ukraine, Israel's destruction [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=75.9s)]
*  of Gaza, bombing Yemen, and now this new war that the United States is becoming increasingly [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=85.12s)]
*  involved in in lots of different ways, and we're only on the fifth day, and you just [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  see so many Americans on a dime. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  The minute a new war is presented to them, with whatever pretext can be conjured, even [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  if they're exactly the same pretext that most Americans lived through watching, proved to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=108.0s)]
*  be complete lies the last time it was used in 2003, even though it's exactly the same [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=114.0s)]
*  script, exactly the same pretext, coming from exactly the same people, you can get enough [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=118.56s)]
*  Americans to immediately stand up and start cheering for death and destruction and bombing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=125.72s)]
*  Not all. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=130.18s)]
*  A very substantial minority oppose it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=131.18s)]
*  I think if the US overtly gets even more involved in the war in Iran, obviously anything resembling [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=134.46s)]
*  ground troops entering Iran, but even perhaps prolonged bombing of Iran as well through [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=139.96s)]
*  US jets and bombs, as President Trump has indicated and Israel has demanded, maybe some [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=146.56s)]
*  of that will erode, that support will erode, but all that's needed is enough support at [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=152.08s)]
*  the beginning of the war to let the government start it, and once the US government enters [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  the war, it doesn't matter anymore whether the people continue to support it, then it's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=160.16s)]
*  just already done, and all the normal arguments are assembled about why we can't stop, why [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=163.72s)]
*  we can't cut and run, why that would be appeasement, etc., etc. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=169.42s)]
*  All the same scripts all the time used over and over, and even though they get proven [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  to be discredited or unpersuasive or full of lies, you just use the same ones each time, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=178.2s)]
*  and that's how the United States stays as a country at war. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=184.2s)]
*  Now we've been hearing a lot of people saying, look, I'm happy that Israel is bombing Iran [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=189.54s)]
*  as long as the US has no involvement in the war, it's not our war, we don't enter it, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=194.26s)]
*  we don't have to pay for it, as long as it's not our war, I'm fine with it, but of course [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=197.98s)]
*  the entire US military, Israeli military rather, is funded by American taxpayers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=203.14s)]
*  Every time Israel has a new war, the arms that it uses, the weapons that it uses, comes [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=209.42s)]
*  from the United States transferred to Israel. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=215.06s)]
*  We pay for their wars, we arm their wars, we support diplomatically those wars, and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  our military assets every single time, and our intelligence apparatus to support and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=223.98s)]
*  enable the war, as the United States is already doing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=229.54s)]
*  We already have multiple new US military assets ordered to the region by President Trump. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=231.86s)]
*  They're already active in protecting Israel from retaliation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=237.82s)]
*  And here from Axios on June 14th, nothing is never enough for Israel, they want more. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=243.06s)]
*  Israel urges the US to join the war with Iran to eliminate the nuclear program. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=249.62s)]
*  Quote, Israel has asked the Trump administration over the past 48 hours to join the war with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=253.98000000000002s)]
*  Iran in order to eliminate its nuclear program, according to Israeli officials. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=258.38s)]
*  The big picture, Israel lacks the bunker bomber, buster bombs, and large bomber aircraft needed [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=262.58s)]
*  to destroy Iran's Forto uranium enrichment site, which is built into a mountain and deep [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=268.18s)]
*  underground. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=273.26s)]
*  The US has both with flying distance of Iran. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=274.26s)]
*  The Trump administration has so far distanced itself from Israel's operation and argued [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=277.58s)]
*  that it would be illegitimate for Iran to retaliate by striking US targets, directly [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=282.26s)]
*  attacking Iran, even if the US's involvement is limited to bombing a single site would [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=286.28s)]
*  pull the US directly into the war. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=290.64s)]
*  Behind the scenes, an Israeli official claimed to Axios that the US might join the operation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  and that President Trump even suggested that he do so if necessary in a recent conversation [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=297.9s)]
*  with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=302.86s)]
*  Quote, that was on Saturday. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=305.1s)]
*  President Trump has openly said that he is considering the possibility of involving the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=306.6s)]
*  US even more directly in this war with Iran. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=310.94s)]
*  Here from ABC News, this was on Sunday, this was yesterday. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=314.18s)]
*  Trump says, quote, it's possible US gets involved in Israel-Iran conflict. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=318.66s)]
*  Quote, in an interview with ABC News' Rachel Scott, Trump declined to comment on whether [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=322.42s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a personal plea for the US to get more [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=327.16s)]
*  involved. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=331.1s)]
*  Quote, we're not involved in it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=332.1s)]
*  It's possible we could get involved, but we are not at this moment involved, the president [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=333.26s)]
*  said. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=337.14s)]
*  Now, that all depends on what you mean by involved. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=338.14s)]
*  We're paying for the war, we're arming the war, we've deployed military assets that are [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=341.3s)]
*  actively now trying to shoot down missiles coming from Iran as retaliation for the Israelis [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=345.46s)]
*  launching a completely unprovoked attack on Iran. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=350.74s)]
*  Based on the claim that Iran was about to get nuclear weapons just weeks away, something [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=354.62s)]
*  they've been saying for 30 years, as we've shown you many times. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=360.1s)]
*  Same thing that was said in 2002. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  Here is Trump today. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=368.82000000000005s)]
*  This is just about 30 minutes ago. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=373.66s)]
*  He issued this decree on True Social. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=376.14000000000004s)]
*  Quote, Iran should have signed the deal I told them to sign. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=379.94s)]
*  What a shame and waste of human life. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=384.98s)]
*  Simply stated, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=386.66s)]
*  I said it over and over. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=389.06s)]
*  Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=391.34s)]
*  Let's just look at that last part because obviously that's quite a statement to make [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=395.26s)]
*  just to be clear when we say everyone should, when he says everyone should immediately evacuate [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=399.58s)]
*  Tehran, notice he's not saying political leaders or military command or the Iranian military [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=405.7s)]
*  or the Revolutionary Guard. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=415.56s)]
*  He's saying everyone, every living person in Tehran should immediately evacuate the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=418.06s)]
*  city. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=421.62s)]
*  That follows a similar instruction that emanated from the government of Israel earlier today. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=422.82s)]
*  You're talking about 14, depending on how you count, 10 million people in the city, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=427.1s)]
*  14 or 16 million people in the area of what would be considered Tehran. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=432.82s)]
*  Why should 16 million people evacuate Iran? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=440.9s)]
*  What is Israel and the United States planning on doing to Tehran that would require 16 million [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=444.02s)]
*  people at 2 a.m. to immediately evacuate? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=452.29999999999995s)]
*  Aren't we just constantly being told that what makes Israel morally superior, I mean [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=455.06s)]
*  I've heard this a thousand times from senators and members of Congress and both political [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=458.5s)]
*  parties, is that unlike Tehran, unlike Iran, which randomly bombs Israel, purposely kills [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=463.74s)]
*  the civilians, the Israelis are extremely, excruciatingly careful never to hurt a single [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=472.3s)]
*  hair on a civilian's head and if they do they're so sorry for it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=478.42s)]
*  Even though the entire world has spent 20 months watching and is still spending the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=483.42s)]
*  21st month watching Israel on a daily basis, blowing up children into a million pieces, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=487.86s)]
*  extinguishing entire families, bombing refugees in tents, and deliberately imposing starvation [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=494.06s)]
*  on Israel, even though we've watched them all with our own eyes do that for close to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=499.9s)]
*  two years, something the U.S. has also paid for unarmed, they have the audacity to say [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=505.14s)]
*  that what makes Israel morally superior is that they don't target civilians. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=509.73999999999995s)]
*  Huge numbers of Iranian civilians have been killed just in the last four days alone, whereas [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=514.4599999999999s)]
*  a handful of Israelis have. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=519.54s)]
*  But here's President Trump ordering close to 16 million people to evacuate Tehran. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=524.14s)]
*  It sounds like the United States is quite involved, given that this order of evacuation [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=529.22s)]
*  is coming from Donald Trump himself. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwCoiLk8gs&t=533.6600000000001s)]
