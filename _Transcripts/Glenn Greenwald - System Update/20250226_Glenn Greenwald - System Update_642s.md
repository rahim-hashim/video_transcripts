# Trump 2028: Trolling or a Real Movement?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc)
*  So I was just chased down and asked if I would like to interview the people behind the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=0.0s)]
*  2028 project, which I can only imagine the meaning of. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so is this serious? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=19.12s)]
*  And how would that be actualized? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=22.96s)]
*  Is it about repealing the 22nd Amendment? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=26.68s)]
*  Yeah, there is a constitutional amendment that's been introduced by Representative Andy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=28.72s)]
*  Ogles of Tennessee. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=34.14s)]
*  It's currently active, so with the third term project, we are pushing support for the Andy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=36.44s)]
*  Ogles Amendment. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=44.04s)]
*  So we're rallying first, you know, starting with more conservative lawmakers in D.C., [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=45.56s)]
*  working on getting them on board as co-sponsors, and then trying to broaden the support from [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  So yes, we are very serious about pushing this, and there's already been an amendment [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=58.28s)]
*  resolution introduced in Congress, so right now we're rallying support behind that amendment. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=62.6s)]
*  But do you really think that two-thirds of state legislatures would ratify the amendment [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=68.88s)]
*  by 2028? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=72.7s)]
*  Usually it can take many years. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=74.48s)]
*  It's definitely, you know... [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=77.08s)]
*  It wouldn't just be Republican states that would have to ratify it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=79.0s)]
*  It's definitely going to take a lot of work, so we're building the foundation right now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  There's a huge groundswell of support, close to 100% support here at CPAC for the idea. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=87.96s)]
*  Our buttons are moving pretty fast, so we're happy to build the groundwork for that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=93.96s)]
*  Obviously, it's going to take a lot of work, but we're happy to do the work. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=99.0s)]
*  So there's no scenario in which Trump could simply disregard the 22nd Amendment, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=103.44s)]
*  No, you're actually advocating for a constitutional process. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  In other words, I've heard it argued that, depending on how you read it, there's potentially [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=114.84s)]
*  some way to read the text of the 22nd Amendment that would enable Trump to run for a third [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=120.04s)]
*  term, maybe because he's been elected to two non-consecutive terms or something along those [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=125.48s)]
*  lines. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  But no, you do think that the 22nd Amendment, as it reads today, would not allow for him [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  to run again? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=135.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, I'm a part of the group, Republicans for National Renewal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=136.8s)]
*  We're for the Constitution, supporting the Constitution, restoring the Constitution. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=140.76s)]
*  So no, we don't want to go around the Constitution. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=145.16s)]
*  We want to amend it, whether it's done through Representative Andy Ogle's constitutional [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=147.8s)]
*  amendment or whether it's done through Article 5, Convention of the States. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=153.56s)]
*  So that's what we're looking for, and we don't want to disregard the Constitution. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=157.76s)]
*  We just want to give the people a choice, and if Trump's had the ballot in 2028 and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=162.32s)]
*  the people want it, that's what they should get. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=165.88s)]
*  Right, so the Article 5 convention, that's never been done before in American history. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  I think it was, didn't Thomas Jefferson say that once every 30 years or something, there [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  should be a new constitutional convention, but that never occurred? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=179.32s)]
*  No. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=182.52s)]
*  Actually, I read in the New York Times maybe a month ago, an article that was pretty good [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=183.52s)]
*  on developments or momentum around the concept of an Article 5 convention that you might [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=188.16s)]
*  not have known about if you're not following the intricacies of that issue. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=194.28s)]
*  So, what's the status of an Article 5 convention, and just explain what that means for people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=198.32s)]
*  who might not be familiar. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=203.36s)]
*  Basically, it would be a convention of the states, so the states could call what would [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=204.36s)]
*  essentially be a constitutional convention to amend the Constitution. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=208.48s)]
*  There's been momentum developing around the idea in recent years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=212.76s)]
*  I know there's been resolution, I'm from the state of Michigan, there's been resolutions [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=216.96s)]
*  that have been active and gaining mainstream support. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=220.48s)]
*  So, for various ideas, people have talked about a balanced budget amendment or something [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=224.12s)]
*  along those lines, so injecting the Trump 2028 idea, the third term project into that, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=228.48s)]
*  into that discussion is something that we're also going to do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=234.6s)]
*  Right now, we're primarily focused on garnering support for Representative Ogle's amendment, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=238.88s)]
*  but we also are going to push for the Article 5 too, in case that doesn't work. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=245.44s)]
*  And what's the underlying motivation for it? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=250.48s)]
*  Is Trump really just that irreplaceable or historically anomalous that JD Vance or Marco [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  Rubio or somebody else couldn't carry on the mantle? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=259.48s)]
*  Why does it have to be Trump personally? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  And he would be, what, 83 or 82 if he were to run again in 2028, which is pretty old. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=265.2s)]
*  Well, if you look at different presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Obama, the recent [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=272.24s)]
*  presidents, they went into office and it looked like, by the end, they looked much older. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=279.68s)]
*  They looked like their vitality was robbed from them from the day-to-day stress of the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=284.32s)]
*  process. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=288.56s)]
*  Trump seems like he's aging in reverse. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=289.56s)]
*  You wouldn't think he was in his late 70s. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=292.24s)]
*  You would think maybe early 60s, 50s. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=294.68s)]
*  So I think he has a special man with the vitality to do the job for another four years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=297.64s)]
*  And you're going with a proven commodity. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=303.32s)]
*  When I got involved in the movement, I was a Ron Paul supporter. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=305.64s)]
*  And Ron Paul, he had a pretty good groundswell of grassroots support, but didn't win a primary, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=308.88s)]
*  didn't come close to winning the nomination. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=315.2s)]
*  Same for Pat Buchanan. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=317.08s)]
*  So Trump was able to fight the establishment and get across the finish line. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=318.08s)]
*  So we want to go with a proven commodity, a proven winner. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=323.12s)]
*  And JD Vance, what is he, 40, 41? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=325.76s)]
*  He'll still be a young man. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  With 2032, when his time comes, he'll still be a young man. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  He'll still be able to take the mantle from there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=334.04s)]
*  But I think we go with a proven commodity. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=336.48s)]
*  What Trump is doing with Doge and with attacking the federal bureaucracy that's been, in my [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  opinion, strangling the American people for so long. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=346.24s)]
*  Let him finish the job. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=350.32000000000005s)]
*  Let him alter the trajectory of the country and give him his third term. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  What would you say to people who hear this idea and think that it's reminiscent of some [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=355.0s)]
*  sort of authoritarianism or this idea that maybe Trump has an excessively outsized cult [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=362.18s)]
*  of personality around him or people are willing to literally revise the Constitution just [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=369.62s)]
*  at his behest. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  Is there anything to that critique? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=378.38s)]
*  Well, let them be outraged. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=379.74s)]
*  A lot of outrage on Twitter right now is getting us a lot of publicity. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=381.74s)]
*  So let them be outraged. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=386.14000000000004s)]
*  But the way I see it is, if you look at what Trump's agenda is doing, he's going after [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=387.8s)]
*  the federal bureaucracy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=391.62s)]
*  He's dismantling the administrative state, the deep state. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=393.34s)]
*  So let that, and that, in my opinion, is decentralization. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=397.34s)]
*  So Trump is decentralizing government. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=401.34s)]
*  He's taking power away from the government, giving it to the people. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=404.9s)]
*  I think that's the opposite of an authoritarian agenda. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=408.41999999999996s)]
*  Foreign policy, I think he's going more toward the direction of non-intervention, whereas [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  Biden was throwing all the money at Ukraine. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, it wouldn't be a non-interventionism to have the U.S. take over Gaza and turn it [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=420.18s)]
*  into a military protectorate, would it? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=425.66s)]
*  Well, you know, the fair point. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=427.62s)]
*  How's his big proposal so far the second term? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=428.86s)]
*  Well, fair point, but I do think that's just more of him throwing some stuff out there, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=431.82s)]
*  trying to get both sides. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=436.02s)]
*  I think it's more of a negotiating tactic than a solid policy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=437.58s)]
*  That's impossible to know. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=440.98s)]
*  I mean, he's repeated it over and over. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=441.98s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=443.78s)]
*  Well, I'm willing to give Trump some leeway on stuff like that, considering, I think, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=444.94s)]
*  that he does, he generally wants to go in more of a direction of peace. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=450.05999999999995s)]
*  So I'm willing to give him more leeway on that, but generally, especially what he's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=456.02s)]
*  been doing in Ukraine, I think, is going in the right direction, not just giving a blank [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=459.85999999999996s)]
*  check to Zelensky, trying to get, you know, Russia and Ukraine to the table to negotiate [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=464.14s)]
*  some sort of peace. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  So I'm willing to give him more leeway than probably you are on that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=474.7s)]
*  So is there anything that could happen in the next three years or anything Trump could [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=475.7s)]
*  do that would make you change your mind on whether this is a good idea? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=481.62s)]
*  Could he actually, just as a hypothetical, is there anything that you can conceive of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=486.46s)]
*  that would maybe make you reconsider whether you want to enable him to be permanently installed [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=491.62s)]
*  into power? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=497.18s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=498.18s)]
*  I think we know what we're getting with Trump. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=499.18s)]
*  I think it's, you know, his second term, I think he's learned a lot of the lessons from [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=501.26s)]
*  his first term. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=506.73999999999995s)]
*  I think you look at Tulsi Gabbard as DNI, you look at RFK as Health and Human Services [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=507.73999999999995s)]
*  Secretary, Cash Patel, the head of the FBI, Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=515.4599999999999s)]
*  I think you see those are four outsiders who have been put into those roles, and it shows [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=521.3s)]
*  that he's not putting in swamp creatures, so to speak, in key roles. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=526.78s)]
*  That's a lot of power over the bureaucracy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=532.86s)]
*  So I think he's going clearly in the right direction, and I don't see anything that could [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  happen in the next three years that would change my mind or the mind of the people here [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=538.74s)]
*  that Trump should have his third term. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=543.62s)]
*  Finally, you do have a likeness of Trump where he is represented as Caesar. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=545.38s)]
*  People might look at that and wonder about the potential of some kind of tyrannical [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=554.28s)]
*  rule. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=560.28s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's still a bit tongue-in-cheek, but I don't know, what's the relationship [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=561.28s)]
*  between Trump and Caesar, or what led to that symbol? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=565.92s)]
*  We think it's good optics. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, like I said, you know, people get offended if they are going to cry on Twitter. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  That's going to help, that's going to give us good publicity. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=576.48s)]
*  It's a little bit of a trolling then. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=579.52s)]
*  Let them be triggered. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=580.76s)]
*  That's kind of the way we're going with our advertising and our promotions. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQSdGZfcGc&t=582.24s)]
