# Senator Rand Paul: Neocons HIJACKED Trump's Bill
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg)
*  Senator Paul, it's great to see you back on the show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=8.72s)]
*  I don't know if this is necessarily what we were intending to talk about when we first [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=10.72s)]
*  invited you a couple weeks ago, but now you're in the middle of the debate and controversy [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=14.24s)]
*  over the gigantic budget bill that Donald Trump and many members of Congress are advocating. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=18.8s)]
*  You yourself have become a vocal opponent of it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=24.48s)]
*  Based on arguments that you and your colleagues in the libertarian movement have long been [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=27.94s)]
*  arguing that it increases the debt, our debt is already unsustainable, and it's not the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=32.86s)]
*  first time, this is the second time that you become a vocal opponent of President Trump's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=37.34s)]
*  one of his signature policies when he became a vocal opponent of his terrorist policy as [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=41.46s)]
*  well, and President Trump, I'm sure you saw, attacked you earlier today saying something [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=46.02s)]
*  like you don't understand the bill, it's time for you to be removed from Congress. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  I'm just wondering how you think about in your role as a senator the various kind of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=55.58s)]
*  obligations that you have on the one hand to the president who was elected based on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=60.54s)]
*  a pretty large mandate that included a whole variety of ideas about the budget and then [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=65.06s)]
*  the state of Kentucky and its constituents and then your own principles and your own [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=69.94s)]
*  conscience and how you navigate those or prioritize them in the event that they conflict. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=74.62s)]
*  I think each person in elected office is elected with their own sort of mandate or their own [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=80.18s)]
*  sort of promises. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=84.78s)]
*  You promise people, you tell people what you stand for, and one of the key proponents I've [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=86.34s)]
*  talked about and stood for from the very beginning is I believe in a very limited government, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=91.14s)]
*  a federal government that's, I used to say, so small you can barely see it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=95.62s)]
*  I don't want to involve in our personal lives or economic lives, I want a very, very small [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=99.7s)]
*  government, but that would be a government that runs a balanced budget, and so these [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=103.86s)]
*  are things that I've been for from the beginning, from the beginning of my entry into public [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=107.42s)]
*  life, so it would be hard for me to change that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=113.62s)]
*  With the bill that's before us, the big beautiful bill, what I am opposed to is primarily raising [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=116.78s)]
*  the debt ceiling $5 trillion, because the implication is if you raise it $5 trillion, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=121.82s)]
*  that means you're going to borrow $5 trillion over the next year or two. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=127.06s)]
*  To put this in perspective, in March of this year, the Republicans were confronted with [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=131.62s)]
*  a spending bill. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=137.18s)]
*  They had to keep government open or not, they had to keep it open at certain levels. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=138.18s)]
*  Interestingly, most of the Republicans in March voted to keep it open at the Biden spending [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=142.78s)]
*  levels, which is kind of ironic since during the campaign they criticized Bidenomics and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=147.18s)]
*  Biden spending and Biden this and Biden that, but the spending levels they voted for in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=152.5s)]
*  March were Biden spending levels, but as a consequence, in September, at the end of our [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=157.94s)]
*  fiscal year, the deficit's going to be about $2 trillion, $2.2 trillion. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=162.3s)]
*  So I voted against those spending levels, but now my concern is that if we're going [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=167.18s)]
*  to borrow $2 trillion this year and they want to raise the ceiling to $5 trillion, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=171.06s)]
*  what does that mean for next year? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=175.9s)]
*  I think it means they're going to borrow well over $2 trillion again next year, which to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=177.98s)]
*  me doesn't sound like what we say we stand for, so I'm just not for it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=181.9s)]
*  Well, and just along those lines, I mean, this is an argument that I actually have been [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=186.06s)]
*  hearing a lot but don't quite understand. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=189.62s)]
*  The argument has been, look, yes, you were elected to represent the people of Kentucky, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=191.38s)]
*  but Donald Trump was represented to elect the entire country, got this mandate, you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=195.1s)]
*  on some level owe him some deference. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=198.58s)]
*  I don't recall President Trump running on a platform of massively increasing federal [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=200.9s)]
*  borrowing or the federal debt, and in fact, one of his principal policies that he wanted [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=206.3s)]
*  to do is to have Elon Musk come in, and it became doge to kind of cut the fat of government [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=213.34s)]
*  and reduce government spending. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  Earlier today, Elon Musk seemed to have sided with you and essentially said that he agrees [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=219.58s)]
*  completely that this bill is, in his words, an abomination, principally because of its [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  failure to cut the necessary spending that would get our debt lowered. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=228.98s)]
*  Do you think that that might have an impact in either requiring a kind of fundamental [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  overhaul of this bill or even potentially stopping it? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=238.7s)]
*  Well, you know, he has a fairly significant platform. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=241.38s)]
*  What do they call it? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=244.1s)]
*  Oh, X, you know, what used to be Twitter is X. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=245.1s)]
*  That's a pretty big platform. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=247.42s)]
*  So his message definitely gets out there, and to put it in contrast, this is, I think, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  what is sad about it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=254.42s)]
*  He gave up, you know, a portion of his life to come in, try to help the country, try to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=255.8s)]
*  find waste and fraud and get rid of it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=260.2s)]
*  So they came up with about 200 billion, give or take, but about 200 billion worth of actual [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=262.56s)]
*  savings that they found. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  The new bill we're looking at has 300 billion dollars worth of new spending for military [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=270.48s)]
*  and for border, and so the new bill actually spends more than all of the accumulated savings [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=275.68s)]
*  that Doge found, which has yet to be codified. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=282.58s)]
*  But the contrast between the two, and to my mind, look, I don't believe in a wide open [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=286.06s)]
*  border, but I also don't think that if you're fiscally conservative, you should believe [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=290.38s)]
*  in unlimited money for a border. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=294.32s)]
*  There is also the argument that 95 percent of the influx of people across the border [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=297.26s)]
*  has diminished just by the sheer personality of Donald Trump as much as anything, that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  maybe we don't need a wall or a fence for the remaining thousand miles. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=307.7s)]
*  But then they ask us for 46 billion. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=311.98s)]
*  At the current expenditures, that would pave or make a wall for 7,000 miles. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=314.58s)]
*  And some wise anchor in my caucus said, oh yeah, we're going to make a fence with Canada [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=320.5s)]
*  next. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=324.62s)]
*  And he was joking, but the thing is, is we can't just quit being fiscally conservative [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=325.62s)]
*  when we believe in, you know, well, the government has a role in having a secure border. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=331.06s)]
*  Doesn't mean we should throw, you know, throw out the baby with the bathwater and just spend [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=335.18s)]
*  anything. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=338.86s)]
*  We still should be fiscally conservative on what we spend. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  Of course, there's always the question, as you know, is, you know, I remember we spent [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=343.1s)]
*  two months focused almost entirely on Doge and Elon Musk cuts and the White House claimed [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=348.22s)]
*  that he was really eliminating finally all this fad and unnecessary spending in the government, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=352.66s)]
*  something like, as you said, 150, 250 billion dollars. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=356.98s)]
*  And then in one fell swoop, President Trump announced very proudly that he wanted to have [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=359.58000000000004s)]
*  the first ever trillion dollar military budget, which would require basically the exact amount [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=362.7s)]
*  that that Elon and the Doge team had just eliminated to be shifted to this kind of new [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=367.86s)]
*  brand of military industrial contractors like Palantir and the like, on top of all of the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=373.26s)]
*  other things. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=378.06s)]
*  The question then always becomes, you know, you have your colleague Josh Hawley, a Republican, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=379.18s)]
*  saying I won't vote for any bill that cuts Medicaid because that is the medical program [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=382.42s)]
*  on which the people who voted us into office rely. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=387.62s)]
*  Do you think that a chunk of the cuts that you've envisioned as necessary to get down [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=391.42s)]
*  this national debt can be made safely in national defense? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=395.94s)]
*  Or do you think it needs to cut into the programs that all polls show Americans like most, which [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=399.5s)]
*  are Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=404.58s)]
*  I felt from the very beginning that this bill was secretly hijacked and sometimes not so [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=407.34s)]
*  secretly hijacked by the neoconservatives who want to explode the military budget. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  They care about defense contractors. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=417.41999999999996s)]
*  They get rewarded by defense contractors. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=419.17999999999995s)]
*  They really love war in a way. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=421.53999999999996s)]
*  They love agitation and war wherever they can find it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=423.62s)]
*  And they sort of fear war ever ending, you know, because it's this constant supply of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=426.53999999999996s)]
*  billions and trillions of dollars. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=431.26s)]
*  But they hijacked this bill. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=433.46s)]
*  From the very beginning, that's all they cared about was increasing the military levels. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=434.46s)]
*  But they'd already gotten an increase in the military levels. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=438.78s)]
*  The military levels was the one thing up here that's been exempt from any kind of restraint. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=441.26s)]
*  And then they want to add another 150 billion on top of about a 3% increase from last year. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=446.02s)]
*  We still spend more on our military than the next at least 10 countries combined. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=451.46000000000004s)]
*  It is not a small amount of money. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=456.58000000000004s)]
*  It's just extraordinary. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=458.5s)]
*  Right now, we have bases in 700 countries. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=459.5s)]
*  So there's a lot we could do on restraint. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=462.74s)]
*  Now the good thing is, is that on occasion, Donald Trump really does sound like a president [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=466.1s)]
*  who believes in foreign policy restraint. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=469.90000000000003s)]
*  When he was in Saudi Arabia, he said the era of nation building and interfering in everybody's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=472.54s)]
*  country is over. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=477.06s)]
*  And that sounded good. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=478.82s)]
*  And I think many of his instincts are in that direction. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=480.3s)]
*  But I think he has some advisors. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed6svBjfgg&t=483.38s)]
