# French "Democracy" Bans Leading Populist from Running
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A)
*  One of the ironies I think in Western politics or throughout the democratic world over the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=0.0s)]
*  last let's say decade or so has been there is a group of people, a very powerful faction, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  you could say the kind of establishment faction that's composed of both the center left and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  the center right in most Western democracies that have engaged in all sorts of highly classically [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=22.8s)]
*  anti-democratic measures in the name of saving democracy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=32.32s)]
*  They herald themselves as the saviors and guardians of democracy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=37.68s)]
*  They say that only their enemies are a threat to democracy, they're the saviors of it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=42.06s)]
*  But the reality of politics in the democratic world over the last decade has been that for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=47.24s)]
*  a variety of factors in the U.S. you can go back to the war on terror and the lies of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=51.04s)]
*  the Iraq war, but more recently the 2008 financial crisis whose repercussions are expressing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=56.8s)]
*  themselves to this very day jeopardizing people's financial security, policies of free trade [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  and deindustrialization, and then all the deceit and crackdowns around COVID have turned [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=68.88s)]
*  portions of the population into vehement anti-establishment warriors. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  These people hate these establishments. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=80.48s)]
*  They hate whoever they perceive as defenders of the status quo. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=83.48s)]
*  It started to express itself in 2016 with things like the British people voting to leave [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=87.84s)]
*  the EU out of hatred and contempt for EU bureaucrats in Brussels and then obviously followed a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  few months later by what was for most people the shocking victory of Donald Trump over [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  the ultimate establishment maven, Hillary Clinton, and ever since then it's been one [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=102.92s)]
*  after the next. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=108.04s)]
*  And obviously, historically, when establishments feel threatened by some new event or some [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=109.04s)]
*  shift in political sentiment, their tendency being the establishment is not to assuage [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=115.16s)]
*  it, not to persuade it, but to crush it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=120.44s)]
*  And the establishment today, unlike say 400 or 500 years ago, are not monarchs in name, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=125.08s)]
*  they're not. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=131.28s)]
*  Church is a name with some sort of absolute say, the way the Catholic Church had over [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=133.96s)]
*  a lot of countries. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=140.08s)]
*  They have to pretend to be Democrats, people who believe in democracy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=141.08s)]
*  That's how they pitch themselves. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=144.88s)]
*  And so they have been just openly doing things like censoring their political opponents, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=147.24s)]
*  creating an industry designed to decree truth and falsity that nobody can deviate from with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=152.2s)]
*  this disinformation industry, and more disturbingly, and I think more desperately, showing how [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=156.08s)]
*  desperate they really are because in so many countries the establishment is in deep trouble, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=160.56s)]
*  typically because of an emerging right wing populist movement, occasionally because of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=165.12s)]
*  left wing populism as well, both of which manifest as anti-establishment movements. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=170.24s)]
*  Their solution has just been to basically bar democracy, limit democracy, prevent the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=176.8s)]
*  most popular opponents of the establishment, typically right wing populists, from even [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=183.52s)]
*  running on the ballot, from just saying you're banished from the election. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=188.32s)]
*  The thing we're told is what Putin does when he has fraudulent elections because his opponents [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=191.72s)]
*  can't run. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=196.44s)]
*  These are just theatrical elections that are very stage managed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=197.44s)]
*  That's exactly what has been happening throughout the democratic world in multiple different [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=202.56s)]
*  countries over at least the last decade. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=206.24s)]
*  And a lot of people are noting that even more now because of what happened in France here [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=209.88s)]
*  from the New York Times yesterday, Marine Le Pen barred from French presidential run [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=213.8s)]
*  after embezzlement ruling. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  The verdict effectively barred the current front runner in the 2027 presidential election. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  You're going to see how common that fact is in all of these cases. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=227.24s)]
*  She's the current front runner in the 2027 presidential election, meaning the French [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=231.44s)]
*  people, the French citizens, a plurality of them or a majority of them want Marine Le [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  Pen to be their next president. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=241.4s)]
*  But it bars her from the 2027 presidential election, from participating in it, an extraordinary [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  step but one the presiding judge said was necessary because nobody is entitled to, quote, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=250.08s)]
*  immunity and violation of the rule of law. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=255.12s)]
*  Dordain Bardella, Ms. Le Pen's protege and a likely presidential candidate in her absence [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=258.12s)]
*  said on social media, quote, not only has Marine Le Pen been unjustly convicted, French [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=262.7s)]
*  democracy has been executed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  The verdict infuriated Ms. Le Pen, an anti-immigration, immigrant nationalist politician who has [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=270.28s)]
*  already mounted three failed presidential bids. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, failed in a very literal sense that she didn't win. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=278.44s)]
*  But her party and she have been, the party as founded by her father was a very fringe [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=285.0s)]
*  party and under her leadership it has become a mainstream party, one of the most powerful [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=291.76s)]
*  parties in France. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=296.88s)]
*  She made the runoff twice. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=299.04s)]
*  So it's failure in the sense she didn't become the president but it's hard to say these are [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  failures in the sense that the French people rejected her. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=305.44s)]
*  She's been gaining more and more support over the years to the point where her party won [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=308.44s)]
*  first place in the EU parliamentary elections last year in France, which is what really [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=313.6s)]
*  scared the French establishment about the possibility that she could actually become [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  president. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=322.6s)]
*  Murmuring, quote, incredible, she briskly left the courtroom before the hearing was [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=323.6s)]
*  Ms. Le Pen, looking grim, told TF1 television that the ruling was a, quote, political attempt [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=328.12s)]
*  to thwart her. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=333.92s)]
*  She said that millions of French people were outraged and she vowed to fight back despite [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=335.36s)]
*  slim chances of legal success. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  Quote, let's be clear, she said, I am eliminated but in reality it's millions of French people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=340.8s)]
*  whose voices have been eliminated. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=345.44s)]
*  Notice I have not uttered a syllable about what I think of Marine Le Pen or her politics [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=349.24s)]
*  or anything like that because it's completely irrelevant. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=353.52s)]
*  If you actually believe in democracy as the premier way to select our leaders, which I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=357.16s)]
*  do, it should be disturbing if it has actually becoming a weapon to exploit the judicial [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=362.44s)]
*  system or use lawfare to defeat your political opponents not at the ballot box, not by giving [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=370.92s)]
*  the people in the country the choice to vote for but by prohibiting them from becoming [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=376.88s)]
*  on the ballot. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=381.82000000000005s)]
*  If you had just one case, then you'd have to spend a lot of time debating Marine Le [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=382.82s)]
*  Pen's case. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=388.62s)]
*  We're going to have somebody on this week who has been following Marine Le Pen's case [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=389.62s)]
*  closely, who understands the intricacies of French law in a way that I don't so I'm not [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=392.5s)]
*  sitting here propounding on the validity or otherwise of her conviction, just the fact [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  that it has now become part of an obvious trend where politicians like her, especially [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=402.94s)]
*  when they become too popular, are being banned. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=407.94s)]
*  There are a lot of people in France who are saying so, including people who are, to put [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=409.74s)]
*  it mildly, not Marine Le Pen friends. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=413.34000000000003s)]
*  One of them is the leftist politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who has found more popularity [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=415.7s)]
*  too. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=423.18s)]
*  He put out a statement on Axe about this, and it's in French, but the highlighted portion [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=425.42s)]
*  is the part that we think is most relevant where he said the decision to remove an elected [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  official should be up to the people. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  Meaning even if you find her guilty, okay, let the people decide whether they want her [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=442.26s)]
*  as president. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=446.94s)]
*  Lorraine Waukes, who is the head of the right wing Republicans, said something similar. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=449.58s)]
*  He posted a tweet on Axe as well, and the translation is, quote, the decision to convict [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=455.66s)]
*  Marine Le Pen is both weighty and exceptional. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=460.58s)]
*  In a democracy, it is unhealthy for an elected official to be barred from running for office, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=462.74s)]
*  political debates must be decided at the ballot box by the French people. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=467.66s)]
*  Oh no, it seems extremely obvious to me. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=471.82000000000005s)]
*  In the United States, of course, even if you're convicted of a crime, then it doesn't mean [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=475.86s)]
*  that you can't run. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=482.5s)]
*  The socialist leader Eugene Debs ran for president as a third party candidate during the Wilson [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=485.98s)]
*  administration from prison. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=491.3s)]
*  Had the Democrats succeeded in convicting and imprisoning Trump before the election [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=493.94s)]
*  as they were desperately trying to do, that would not have resulted in his being banned [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=498.14s)]
*  from the ballot. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=502.09999999999997s)]
*  He could have run even as a convicted felon. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=503.09999999999997s)]
*  In fact, they did convict him of a felony charge or multiple repetitive felony charges [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=504.85999999999996s)]
*  in New York, and he still was permitted to win, and the American people decided. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=510.14s)]
*  We know he was convicted. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=513.5799999999999s)]
*  We don't trust that conviction. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=514.66s)]
*  We think it's politically motivated, and in any event, we want him to be our president. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=515.78s)]
*  That's what democracy means. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=519.86s)]
*  The Democrats tried other ways to get him banned from the ballot as well. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=523.82s)]
*  It got to it, and they almost succeeded. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=526.46s)]
*  That was clearly their goal, but in the United States, at least, it's left to the people [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=527.9000000000001s)]
*  to decide, and that's what a lot of French politicians across the political spectrum [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=531.98s)]
*  are saying. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=535.7s)]
*  Here is the polling data, the most recent polling data on the French presidential election [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=537.86s)]
*  from the International Market Research Group on March 31st. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=541.22s)]
*  Intentions to vote in the presidential election, quote, two years before the next presidential [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=545.2600000000001s)]
*  An IFOP poll for the journal De Dimanche reveals the voting intentions of the French people [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=549.66s)]
*  for the next presidential election. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=555.14s)]
*  In the most favorable scenario, the national rally candidate would collect 37% of voting [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  intentions, that's Marine Le Pen's party, nearly 14 points more than her score in the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=562.18s)]
*  first round in 2022. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=566.38s)]
*  Edouard Philippe appears to be the best-placed candidate to qualify for the second round [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=569.18s)]
*  against Marine Le Pen. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  His score ranges between 20 and 25% depending on the different configurations tested. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=574.5s)]
*  So she's not just leading in the polls, she's leading in the polls by far. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=580.14s)]
*  Not enough to avoid a runoff. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=585.14s)]
*  She's made the runoff twice now and lost to Macron. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=588.18s)]
*  But the question is not, is Marine Le Pen going to be in the second round? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=592.58s)]
*  She for sure will be. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=597.5s)]
*  The question is who can get just enough to make it with her? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=598.5s)]
*  And unlike in the past in France where that party was considered toxic and off limits, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=605.58s)]
*  where everybody would unite to prevent it from gaining any power, that's not really [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=611.06s)]
*  the case anymore. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=614.7s)]
*  I mean you did see that in the subsequent parliamentary elections in France that Macron [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=615.7s)]
*  called after Marine Le Pen's party won the EU parliamentary elections. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=619.58s)]
*  He called new elections for the parliament, dissolved the parliament, called new elections [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=628.18s)]
*  and the left-wing coalition led by Mélenchon, but he wasn't really the candidate because [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=632.9s)]
*  he's too... [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=638.06s)]
*  He alienates too many people outside the actual left. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=639.06s)]
*  Came in first, Macron's party came in second, Le Pen's party came in third, but it was very [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=642.9799999999999s)]
*  closely disputed. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=646.5799999999999s)]
*  So there's the possibility that there could be a coalition to defeat her. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=649.62s)]
*  We're likely never to find out because the French establishment is too afraid to let [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=652.3s)]
*  her run in the ballot as fear that she might win. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=656.82s)]
*  As I said, if that were an isolated case, we could just sort of say, well, is Marine [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=661.66s)]
*  Le Pen guilty? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=664.5s)]
*  That's the French law, but it's by far not an isolated case. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=665.5s)]
*  It has become the common scenario. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12MJHpJJ8A&t=668.02s)]
