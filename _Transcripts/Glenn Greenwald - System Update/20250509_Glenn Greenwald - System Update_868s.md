# Is the Trump/Netanyahu Split Real?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0)
*  All right, let's move to the next topic, which is these reports that there has been a breach [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  in the relationship between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=13.92s)]
*  Now I think we have to be very careful about believing this, in part because there's never [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=19.2s)]
*  really been a real breach between an American president and an Israeli prime minister since [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=28.7s)]
*  you have to go back pretty much to the very early 1990s under George H.W. Bush, where [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=35.3s)]
*  his secretary of state, James Baker, and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=40.78s)]
*  were extremely angry with Israel about expanding settlements in the West Bank because the U.S. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=44.26s)]
*  position always was that it's in the U.S. national interest to achieve a two-state solution [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=48.9s)]
*  between the Palestinians and the Israeli, where they have two states side by side living [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=54.22s)]
*  in peace because the U.S. always understood that tying itself at the hip to Israel while [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=57.26s)]
*  this conflict flared was creating a lot of anti-American sentiment, making it much more [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=63.739999999999995s)]
*  difficult for the U.S. to operate in the Middle East. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=68.7s)]
*  So in response to these expanding settlements in the West Bank, Bush 41 sought to tell the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=70.94s)]
*  Israelis, if you don't stop these settlements immediately, we're going to cancel our loan [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=78.22s)]
*  guarantees. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=81.78s)]
*  There was this insane bipartisan backlash calling Jim Baker and Brent Scowcroft, you [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=83.3s)]
*  know what they called them, anti-Semites. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  And when Bill Clinton ran against George H.W. Bush, Bush 41, in the 1992 election, Bill [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=93.06s)]
*  Clinton strongly suggested or even explicitly said that President Bush and his administration [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=101.5s)]
*  were anti-Semitic because of their refusal to support Israel, just showing you this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=110.24s)]
*  bipartisan dogma that has existed for a long time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=114.96s)]
*  Reagan actually defied the Israelis, including when he withdrew Marine barracks from Lebanon [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=120.88s)]
*  after there was an attack by Hezbollah that killed close to 250 American soldiers, and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=126.06s)]
*  the Israelis said, now you have to go to war to get vengeance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=130.88s)]
*  And Reagan said, no, actually, I don't even know why we're in Lebanon. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  Why do we have bases in Lebanon? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  He pulled them back. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=137.8s)]
*  There's been other times as well, but since then, there was a lot of tension between Obama [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=138.96s)]
*  and Netanyahu, and other than this symbolic UN vote at the end of Obama's term, it never [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=142.4s)]
*  really transformed into policy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=146.74s)]
*  It was Obama, in fact, that signed a $40 billion agreement, $38 billion agreement, to pay the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=148.72s)]
*  Israelis $4 billion a year for the next 10 years. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Some of that goes to buying American weaponry, but not all of it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=160.52s)]
*  So you really have to be very careful about any claim that the American and the President [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=166.04s)]
*  of the Israeli Prime Minister are having a real split, because there's not been a split [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  for a long time between the two countries. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=178.16s)]
*  They've almost merged. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  And then on top of that, almost everybody who surrounds Donald Trump, and we've talked [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=182.92s)]
*  about this before, he has a lot of diversity of opinion and pluralistic ideology in his [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=186.88s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=192.64s)]
*  He has hardcore hawks and neocons on the one hand, then he has anti-interventionists and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  isolationists and more paleoconservatives and the Papua canon, Ron Paul strain of conservatives. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=197.6s)]
*  So he doesn't need homogeneity. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't like homogeneity, except on the issue of Israel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=207.55999999999997s)]
*  You don't have any people really questioning US support for Israel who are in the administration [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  at the top levels. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=218.16s)]
*  Every single person that he picked, that was basically a price of admission through the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=219.8s)]
*  door, and in part that's because he was so heavily funded by pro-Israel interests, starting [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=224.56s)]
*  with Mary Middleton, the Israeli-American billionaire who inherited her husband Sheldon [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=229.56s)]
*  Adelson's massive wealth and uses it, as she openly admits, to make sure that their Republican [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=236.76s)]
*  party stays vehemently and unyieldingly pro-Israel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=242.76s)]
*  So it's not just any American president, but particularly Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  I want to see evidence before I believe this, but as I said, this is not just some conspiracy [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  theory invented out of nowhere. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  I want to show you the reasons why there may be grounds to believe that this is real, starting [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=258.24s)]
*  with the fact that Netanyahu and Trump have famously had tension in their relationship [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  going back to the Trump first presidency. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=269.2s)]
*  But here from the New York Times in April last month, there was a report, and this report's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=274.16s)]
*  everywhere in the media, not just the New York Times, quote, Trump waved off Israeli [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=280.6s)]
*  strike after divisions emerged in his administration. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  You may remember that Netanyahu went to the White House not once, but twice since Trump, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=290.0s)]
*  in the three months since he was inaugurated, and the second time when he went, we were [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=295.68s)]
*  told that the reason he was going was because Trump had just imposed tariffs on Israel, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=300.04s)]
*  which he did. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=304.28s)]
*  But the real reason, it was very clear and it turned out, including in what they said, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=306.16s)]
*  the real reason was because Netanyahu wanted to meet Trump about Israel's desire to bomb [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=310.92s)]
*  Iran, which they could only do if the United States gets heavily involved. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=315.8s)]
*  They need American support in order to do it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=321.08s)]
*  So you have to get Trump's permission, and all reports from the White House, which were [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=324.08s)]
*  never denied, was that Netanyahu was very much trying to convince Trump to give the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=327.96s)]
*  green light to an Israeli attack on Iran, and Trump said, no, I don't want to attack [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=334.4s)]
*  Iran. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=340.08s)]
*  I want to see if we can get an agreement with them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=341.08s)]
*  I prefer an agreement. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=342.76s)]
*  And this is something Trump repeated today, in fact, in the White House. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=344.64s)]
*  Likewise, we're trying to work on Iran to get that solved without having to get into [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=349.64s)]
*  any bombing, as we say, big bombing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=360.52s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=364.44s)]
*  I want them to work a deal. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=365.44s)]
*  I want them to be very successful. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=366.44s)]
*  And this has been a very consistent position Trump has taken. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=367.44s)]
*  Who knows if he means it? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=373.0s)]
*  Who knows if it will sustain the pressure that will obviously be brought in, that's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=374.28s)]
*  already being brought in, as we're about to show you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=380.8s)]
*  And it's not that easy to get an agreement with the Iranians, because the agreement that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=384.4s)]
*  you need the Iranians to agree to has to be substantially better, or at least somewhat [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=388.6s)]
*  better, than the deal that Obama got with the Iranians, because Trump has been saying [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=394.64s)]
*  for eight years now that that was a terrible deal, a deal that was too weak. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=399.64s)]
*  So if you can't get the Iranians beyond that to make more concessions than they made to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=403.32s)]
*  Obama, it's going to be very difficult to get a deal. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=407.16s)]
*  He can't get a deal that's identical to what Obama got, or people say, well, why did you [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=410.16s)]
*  withdraw in the first place? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=413.76s)]
*  I believe that Trump does want to get an agreement. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=415.8s)]
*  I don't think he wants a new Mideast War, major Mideast War. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=417.64s)]
*  He's talked for years about the horrors and wastes of Mideast Wars. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of powerful people in Washington and elsewhere who want that war, including [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=428.0s)]
*  the people in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, and their network of funders and influencers and activists, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=434.32000000000005s)]
*  not just Jewish ones, but evangelical ones, very neocon ones, pro-military ones. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of factions of Washington that consider this relationship with Israel to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  be of the highest priority. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=452.56s)]
*  And for Trump to simply defy that in the way that's being suggested, I want to see a lot [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=454.8s)]
*  more evidence from that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=459.44s)]
*  Here is Israel's largest newspaper, He'an, that reported today Trump sidelines Netanyahu [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=460.44s)]
*  in Middle East policy as relations deteriorate. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=466.68s)]
*  So it's not just coming from the American press or the Middle East or Arab press. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=469.68s)]
*  It's coming from establishment Israeli media outlets. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=474.2s)]
*  Quote, earlier this week, we reported that Netanyahu was frustrated with Trump. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=477.88s)]
*  Now it appears the American president has also lost patience with his Israeli counterpart. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=482.24s)]
*  Two senior figures in Trump's circle stated in recent closed-door conversations, whose [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=486.72s)]
*  content reached Israel-Haim, that Trump has decided to stop waiting for Israel and instead [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=491.52s)]
*  wants to move forward with Middle East initiatives without Netanyahu. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=497.68s)]
*  The sources explain that the president wishes to make decisions he believes will advance [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=501.76s)]
*  American interests, particularly regarding Saudi Arabia and Gulf states. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=505.68s)]
*  Israel was supposed to participate in some of those steps, referring primarily to normalization [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=510.72s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=515.48s)]
*  That has been the kind of golden goose that Israel has been chasing. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=516.48s)]
*  They hope to establish normalized relations with the Sunni states and especially the very [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=520.84s)]
*  wealthy Gulf state countries that are close to the United States and to the West, United [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=528.6s)]
*  Arab Emirates and Qatar, and especially Saudi Arabia, because then they would feel like [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=536.24s)]
*  they had a union against Iran. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=540.8s)]
*  The problem is the Saudis have said always that we can't normalize relations with Israel [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=542.8s)]
*  until they resolve the problem of the Palestinians being denied a state. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=551.44s)]
*  And there's probably not that much authenticity or conviction behind that Saudi position for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=558.84s)]
*  a long time, but once October 7th happened and the Israelis just openly began blowing [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=564.5999999999999s)]
*  up all of Gaza, and obviously people in the Middle East especially are seeing that every [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=568.88s)]
*  day from Al Jazeera, from other outlets. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=573.7199999999999s)]
*  They see it even more than we do. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  In fact, a lot more than we do. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=578.24s)]
*  It basically became just no longer feasible for even these tyrannical governments like [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and the Emirates and Qatar to normalize relations with Israel while they're [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  destroying Gaza without the Palestinians getting any consideration. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=593.8s)]
*  I think there's some extent to which people believe, and I think it's certainly viable, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=597.12s)]
*  that part of Hamas' intent in attacking on October 7th was a fear that the Saudis were [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  going to just go ahead and don't really care about the Palestinians and were going to just [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  keep it on the back burner. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=612.04s)]
*  They were moving toward normalization, and they launched October 7th to reprioritize, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=613.04s)]
*  to put on the front burner the issue of the Palestinians to make it impossible for those [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=621.2s)]
*  other countries to normalize relations with Israel. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=625.5200000000001s)]
*  This Israeli paper goes on, quote, However, according to Trump's perspective, Netanyahu [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=628.88s)]
*  is delaying making the necessary decisions. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  Given the situation, the president refuses to wait until Israel takes its expected actions [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=637.84s)]
*  and is proceeding without Israeli participation. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  Furthermore, Trump is furious about what he views as an attempt by Netanyahu and his team [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=646.96s)]
*  to pressure national security adviser Mike Walz, who has since been dismissed from his [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=652.08s)]
*  position toward military action in Iran. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=656.36s)]
*  Netanyahu claimed in response to the publication of this matter in the Washington Post that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=658.72s)]
*  he spoke with Walz only once. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=662.84s)]
*  However, Trump remained unconvinced. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot going on here. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=665.96s)]
*  I just want to focus on a couple parts of it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  When Mike Walz was fired as Trump's national security adviser after barely 100 days, people [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=672.0s)]
*  were very surprised. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=680.2s)]
*  I was certainly surprised because Trump was unwilling. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=681.2s)]
*  He did not want to feed Democrats or the media a hat on a pike, and that's why he defended [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=683.88s)]
*  Mike Walz even after Signalgate, which of course should have resulted in his firing. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=690.72s)]
*  You cannot let a journalist accidentally into a planning room for a bombing campaign that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=696.02s)]
*  you're about to launch imminently and then basically lie about what happened afterwards. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=702.9s)]
*  It just gave Mike Walz this stench of loser-ness, which is the thing that Trump hates most. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=708.3s)]
*  But what really infuriated Trump was, and there were lots of reports about this, was [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=716.54s)]
*  that Mike Walz was knowing that Trump wanted to avoid war in Iran. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=719.6999999999999s)]
*  Knowing that Trump was trying hard to get an agreement with Iran so that he doesn't [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=725.8199999999999s)]
*  have to go to war with Iran, was plotting with Netanyahu behind Trump's back on basically [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=729.4599999999999s)]
*  how to proceed with this Israeli attack, which would force the United States to be involved. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=736.06s)]
*  I absolutely believe that Trump was enraged when he learned of that, and not just at Mike [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=741.5s)]
*  Walz, but at Netanyahu as well. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=745.66s)]
*  And then there's this other issue with normalization and better relations that the U.S. might pursue [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=749.3399999999999s)]
*  with these Gulf state dictatorships. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=756.0999999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration could have reached agreements with the Saudis, with the Emiratis, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=760.02s)]
*  with the Qataris for much closer ties. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=766.2199999999999s)]
*  But Biden was unwilling to do that unless Israel was satisfied, unless Israel believed [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=770.0999999999999s)]
*  that its interests were also being solved. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=777.26s)]
*  So yet again, Biden sacrificed American interests that could have been advanced with agreements [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=779.18s)]
*  in greater proximity to these very wealthy countries, because he didn't want to upset [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=785.14s)]
*  the Israelis and Israel's supporters in the United States. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=791.18s)]
*  And Trump seems to be saying, and maybe this is for some venal reasons as well, Trump is [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=795.14s)]
*  very, very interested in the money that comes from the Persian Gulf. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=800.98s)]
*  And Jared Kushner went and signed a $2 billion deal with the Saudis for his investment fund. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=805.6999999999999s)]
*  They've been profiting in all sorts of ways with the Emiratis and with the Saudis. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=814.26s)]
*  And so Trump proceeded to be not only in America's interest, but I think in his interest, to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=818.74s)]
*  get these deals that would bring closer proximity with these Gulf states in particular. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=822.62s)]
*  And Trump, when it comes to his interests or more broadly the U.S. interests, just if [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=828.58s)]
*  he wants to do something, he's not going to care as much as Biden did about whether it [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=834.98s)]
*  angers Netanyahu. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBhr3rvufQ0&t=839.9s)]
