# Populism's Surge in the U.S. and Europe: Political Scientist Sheri Berman Explains
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU)
*  We are delighted to be able to have a true scholar and an expert who has been studying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=0.0s)]
*  through her research and scholarship not only the current nature of EU politics but also [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  all kinds of European history as well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=20.96s)]
*  She is Professor Sherry Berman who is a political scientist on the faculty of Barnard College [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  of Columbia University. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=29.56s)]
*  Her scholarship is focused on European history and EU politics, the development of democracy, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=30.56s)]
*  populism and fascism and the history of the left. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=35.64s)]
*  From 2009 to 2012, Professor Berman served as chair of the Barnard Political Science [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=38.64s)]
*  Department and then again in the fall of 2021 as well as chair of the Council on European [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=43.32s)]
*  Studies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=48.32s)]
*  Her most recent book is entitled Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe, From the Ancient [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Regime to the Present Day published in 2019. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=55.4s)]
*  And she is also the author of an op-ed that was published just yesterday entitled, quote, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=57.64s)]
*  How Serious is Europe's Anti-Democratic Threat? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=63.72s)]
*  Published in Project Syndicate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=66.8s)]
*  So it's very obvious that she is in a very excellent position to help us understand these [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=68.58s)]
*  elections and the dynamics that led to them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=73.44s)]
*  Professor Berman, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=76.16s)]
*  I know there's a lot of confusion, a lot of uncertainty about this election and we are [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=79.52s)]
*  thrilled to have you here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=83.22s)]
*  Thanks for taking the time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=84.28s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=85.28s)]
*  So let me just start by asking this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=86.28s)]
*  There's obviously a lot of discourse surrounding this election, a lot of attempts to try and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=90.12s)]
*  understand it, but at the same time, EU parliamentary elections are notoriously, sparsely voted [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=93.68s)]
*  for just like a lot of primaries and off-year elections are. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=100.8s)]
*  How much meaning do you think can be derived from these results? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=103.72s)]
*  So that's a great question because you're right, up until fairly recently these elections [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=108.88s)]
*  got many fewer voters to the polls than national elections did. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=113.24s)]
*  That's begun to change. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, anyone who was following the news in Europe would have seen much more attention [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  paid to these elections than previous one, much more attention on the news, much more [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=124.0s)]
*  attention online, much more debate among the parties themselves about the election and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=128.48s)]
*  its consequences. So that has begun to change. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  And so these elections are somewhat different than previous ones and the election participation [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=137.84s)]
*  level was up somewhat. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=144.28s)]
*  I do not think it is any longer correct to see these elections as distinct from national [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=145.84s)]
*  elections. As you said, it's no longer the case that folks will often wrote one way in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=152.92s)]
*  the European elections and then another way in the national elections. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  The kind of standard line was that you more often saw protest votes at the European elections [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=162.52s)]
*  because the stakes were lower and more moderate votes at the national level. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=167.96s)]
*  That has begun to change. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  And so I think these election results are not bad reflection of public opinion in the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=175.56s)]
*  country's overall. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=180.84s)]
*  One of the points you made in the article that you published that I just referenced, I [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=182.84s)]
*  should say, as I said, it's important not to overstate the tumultuous nature of these [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=189.92s)]
*  results because the kind of status quo party did eventually get a majority, although clearly [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=194.84s)]
*  there are a lot of changes going on. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=201.0s)]
*  One of the things you emphasized was that at least in Germany and France and the Netherlands, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  these election results didn't come out of nowhere. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=206.64s)]
*  They were kind of a part of events leading up to it that you could almost predict. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=208.64s)]
*  And I just want to read this one paragraph that you wrote, quote, right wing populist [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=212.56s)]
*  forces have indeed enjoyed remarkable success in recent years. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=215.8s)]
*  In twenty twenty two, the Brothers of Italy became the largest party in Italy, elevating [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  its leader, Georgia Maloney, to the premiership. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=223.08s)]
*  The Sweden Democrats have become the country's second largest party and now have a dominant [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=225.4s)]
*  position in the right wing government. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=229.36s)]
*  In France, national rallies Marine Le Pen achieved her best result yet in the twenty [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=231.12s)]
*  twenty two election. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=234.68s)]
*  And then you referred to Geert Wilders victory in the Netherlands and the Finns party [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=235.8s)]
*  placed second in the Finnish election. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  Now, I want to get to in a minute whether there are differences in the dynamics driving [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=244.16s)]
*  this in each country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=249.12s)]
*  But before I get to that, can you say whether it is concerns about immigration or concerns [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=250.12s)]
*  about economic difficulties or kind of a general animosity toward EU leadership that is driving [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=260.24s)]
*  the rise of this right wing populism? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  What do you see as its causes? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  So I'll take that last question first. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=270.84s)]
*  So I think the answer to that question is all of the above. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=273.02s)]
*  So if you look at the issues that European voters are most concerned about, the ones [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=276.29999999999995s)]
*  that you mentioned very much come out on top in almost all European countries. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=282.02s)]
*  That is to say immigration and economic concerns, jobs, economic insecurity, social welfare [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=287.46s)]
*  state, those kinds of things. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=296.58s)]
*  So people are concerned about both economic and about immigration related issues. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=297.82s)]
*  But also, you know, sort of on top of that is the other factor that you mentioned, which [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=304.5s)]
*  is a kind of resentment of or a disillusionment with the ability of what you might call mainstream [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=309.3s)]
*  or establishment politicians and parties to deal with these issues. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=317.18s)]
*  So it's one thing to say, look, voters have a series of concerns and demands. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=322.84s)]
*  And then it's another thing to say, well, those concerns and demands lead them to vote [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  for, let's say, right wing populists as opposed to traditional social democrats or Christian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=332.88s)]
*  democrats. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=339.0s)]
*  Clearly, they are voting for populists because they believe that the parties that have that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=340.0s)]
*  establishment history were not doing their job. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=346.0s)]
*  That is to say they were not dealing with the economic and immigration related challenges [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=349.84s)]
*  that they see their countries facing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=354.32s)]
*  Just to focus on that point a little bit in terms of the role immigration is playing, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  because I do think it's often assumed by American analysts looking at it through kind of American [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=361.84s)]
*  lens that the reason right wing populism is increasing is because of concern about it [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=367.08s)]
*  and even hatred for this increase in immigration that we've seen in Europe. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  And that concern of or anger toward immigration is in turn fueled by racism, white nationalism [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=378.3s)]
*  and the like. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  It is interesting because as recently as 15 years ago, the standard left wing position [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=387.38s)]
*  in the US and throughout Europe was to be a little bit opposed or even a lot opposed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  to immigration on the grounds that it would drive down wages for American workers and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=395.78000000000003s)]
*  the like. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=399.74s)]
*  And it's sort of recent that this fear of immigration has been put through a kind of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=400.74s)]
*  racism prison. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=404.74s)]
*  One of the things you also wrote in this article that I just want to ask you about, you say [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=406.62s)]
*  there is not much cross national correlation between levels of racism or xenophobia and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=412.14s)]
*  populism success in a given country. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=417.74s)]
*  Some countries with the low levels of racism and xenophobia like Sweden have large populist [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=420.18s)]
*  parties, whereas some countries with higher racism and xenophobia like Ireland and Portugal [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=424.9s)]
*  do not. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=430.02s)]
*  And as a general matter, racism and xenophobia have declined in almost all Western societies [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=431.02s)]
*  over the past decades, while support for right wing populism has grown. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=435.86s)]
*  So is in your view, and it seems like it is, but maybe you can elaborate on this, the view [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=440.74s)]
*  in the United States that anti-immigration sentiment is primarily driven by racism. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=445.62s)]
*  Do you think that's overstated? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=449.78s)]
*  I do think that's OK. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=453.3s)]
*  That's not to say that racism and xenophobia don't exist and that it's not driving some [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=454.74s)]
*  voters in Europe and certainly in the United States. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=459.94s)]
*  But stopping there really misses, as you mentioned, both the cross national differences in support. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  There are countries that, you know, no matter how many polls you take, come out quite low [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=470.46s)]
*  on these sentiments and yet still have very large levels of support for right wing populist [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=475.46s)]
*  parties and also the overtime dynamic, which a lot of people also don't seem fully aware [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=480.82s)]
*  of. That is to say that, you know, almost everywhere in the West, these kinds of sentiments [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=486.78s)]
*  have declined, not as much as they should, of course, but they have declined at the same [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=492.02s)]
*  time as support for these parties is going on. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=495.85999999999996s)]
*  So to stop your explanation there is just it's too easy and it's also empirically inaccurate. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=497.9s)]
*  So what we have to do is we have to layer on a more sophisticated understanding of what [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=504.97999999999996s)]
*  voters concerns really are. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=510.09999999999997s)]
*  And if you dig deeper into concerns about immigration, in particular, they tend to focus [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=512.22s)]
*  on two types of things that you've already mentioned. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=517.78s)]
*  One is straightforward economic concerns, which is why, as you said, the left was really [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=521.14s)]
*  quite hesitant about immigration up until a generation ago. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=525.9s)]
*  Jobs are scarce. Economic insecurity has increased. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=530.62s)]
*  Access to government resources has become more difficult. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=534.46s)]
*  And in those kinds of situations, people it's very easy to make people look at newcomers [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=538.22s)]
*  to the country and see them as taking up resources and the job community, you know, using [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=543.38s)]
*  community institutions that they feel very concerned about. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=549.9s)]
*  So there is tons of research that shows that in these kinds of difficult economic situations [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=553.4599999999999s)]
*  where people feel that they're in some kind of zero sum competition, it's much harder [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=559.1s)]
*  to gain acceptance for immigration. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  There is also some other concerns that while I would not consider to be racism or xenophobia, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=566.74s)]
*  straightforward do relate to sort of levels of social change. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=572.62s)]
*  These are concerns that I would put more correctly, I would say, under the rubric of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=576.38s)]
*  assimilation or integration. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=582.54s)]
*  There's much easier for people to accept newcomers when they feel like those newcomers [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=584.62s)]
*  are willing to respect national traditions, play by the rules of the game, you know, accept [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=589.9399999999999s)]
*  the rule of law, these kinds of things. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=596.78s)]
*  So these are not should not be, I think, conflated with racism and xenophobia, both because [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=598.82s)]
*  they are not and also because understanding these differences points to different ways of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=604.14s)]
*  dealing with them. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=608.38s)]
*  Absolutely. One of the points you've made, both in that article and I've seen you make it [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=609.38s)]
*  elsewhere in other writings and things you've done that actually surprised me a little bit [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=613.86s)]
*  just based on press coverage in the US is that other than the AFD in Germany, which is [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=618.78s)]
*  just its own sort of very extremist manifestation, that by and large these what was once [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=622.9399999999999s)]
*  called fringe far right, even proto-fascist parties in Europe have to a large extent [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=630.02s)]
*  moderated and even kind of integrated themselves into mainstream. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=636.3s)]
*  I remember when Georgia Maloney was elected and it was the headlines everywhere in the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=639.78s)]
*  United States where she's a new Mussolini, she's a fascist, Italian democracy is over. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=643.06s)]
*  And then in a very short amount of time, she announced support for the war in Ukraine, kind [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=647.1s)]
*  of embraced a lot of EU policies, made clear she doesn't intend to be revolutionary, at [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=650.6999999999999s)]
*  least internationally. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=655.54s)]
*  And you don't hear that anymore. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=657.1s)]
*  In what respects have these right wing parties generally, other than the one in Germany, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=659.3s)]
*  moderated? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=664.78s)]
*  So they many of them, but not all. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=667.42s)]
*  And the AFD is the is the key most important example. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=670.14s)]
*  Many of them have moderated. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=674.06s)]
*  Maloney is a good example. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=675.74s)]
*  I mean, as you mentioned, when she was elected, there were headlines on both sides of the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=677.1s)]
*  Atlantic about a new fascism in Italy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=680.9s)]
*  That term is still used, fascism, with regard to Marin Le Pen and the national rally. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=684.9s)]
*  I think this is is inaccurate and also dangerous, dangerous because when you call someone a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=691.7399999999999s)]
*  fascist, there is no real way to sort of cooperate with them and their supporters become [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=698.0999999999999s)]
*  beyond the pale. That is to say, people that it's not worth reaching out to. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=704.42s)]
*  The fact that these parties, some of them, I would say Maloney is a great example. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=708.38s)]
*  Marin Le Pen's party, anybody who's old enough to remember Marin Le Pen's father knows [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=713.18s)]
*  that there has been a very significant shift between her and her father. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=719.3399999999999s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that one shouldn't be concerned. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=724.4599999999999s)]
*  It does mean that one should recognize that shift. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=726.5799999999999s)]
*  And if one is a small D Democrat, one should welcome that and want to encourage it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=729.26s)]
*  You may still very much disagree with the policies that she stands for, but that's fine. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=735.3s)]
*  The question is, is she still pushing for racist, unconstitutional policies? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=740.54s)]
*  If she's not, then she is part of a legitimate Democratic field of competition. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=747.38s)]
*  There's a big difference between, as I said, Marin Le Pen and her father's party, the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=753.34s)]
*  National Front. There's a big difference between Maloney and some of the neo-fascist [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=758.66s)]
*  movements her party grew out of. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=763.66s)]
*  There's a big difference between the Sweden Democrats today and the neo-fascist movements [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=765.3s)]
*  that they came out of. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=770.1s)]
*  Again, I'm not saying one should not be wary, but one should also recognize the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=770.9s)]
*  difference, throwing them all under the label of fascist or even far right for that matter. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=776.58s)]
*  I think at this point obscures more than it clarifies. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's so interesting how Marin Le Pen has very aggressively, very explicitly [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=783.98s)]
*  distanced herself not just from her father, but from his ideology. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=788.38s)]
*  They've expelled some of those old members and really worked hard to create this new [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=791.78s)]
*  identity. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=795.34s)]
*  The passage from your article that I referenced talked about these events that led up to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=796.3000000000001s)]
*  this EU election that kind of were a harbinger of the results that we saw and probably [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=800.38s)]
*  more future events. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=805.62s)]
*  When I think though about animosity toward Brussels and to EU institutions and just [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=807.1s)]
*  kind of a general anger towards them, I of course first think about the 2016 vote in [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=812.94s)]
*  the United Kingdom where they approved Brexit, where they just left the EU. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=818.0200000000001s)]
*  They didn't even like limit the control of Brussels. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=821.74s)]
*  They just left. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=824.02s)]
*  I know in some sense, British politics and the UK itself are a little bit different from [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=826.62s)]
*  European politics because of geography and history and the like. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=832.0600000000001s)]
*  But did you see, do you see Brexit as a similar dynamic to what is driving this rise of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=834.66s)]
*  populism that we're now discussing as well? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=842.1s)]
*  Well, I think first, as you said, it's important to note that the British have always been a [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=846.1s)]
*  little bit different. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=849.5s)]
*  They joined the EU very late. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=850.0600000000001s)]
*  They joined the EU very late and somewhat reluctantly. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=852.14s)]
*  And so that they were the last in of the big countries in the first out is perhaps not [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=855.54s)]
*  that surprising. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=861.6999999999999s)]
*  Personally, I think that was a mistake on the part of the Brits, but I'm not British. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=862.66s)]
*  So my view is completely and utterly irrelevant. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=866.78s)]
*  It was not an anti-democratic decision. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=869.02s)]
*  It may be one that some people think is unwise, but it is not anti-democratic. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=871.9s)]
*  I would note that parties like the National Rally in France, Marin Le Pen's party and [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=876.58s)]
*  the further right parties in Italy, including Maloney initially, were quite EU skeptical. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=882.22s)]
*  They have moderated on that as well because it serves their interests. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=887.58s)]
*  They recognize that their citizens, as much as they complain, often legitimately about [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=891.14s)]
*  EU policies or about the continued democratic deficit, as some people refer to it in your [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=896.42s)]
*  generally, people benefit more than they do not. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=901.9399999999999s)]
*  And so while criticism may be quite sharp, demands to actually leave are really quite [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=905.02s)]
*  low. So they are reflecting their populations ambivalent, I would say, attitude sometimes [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=911.98s)]
*  towards the EU. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=918.94s)]
*  But they are no longer calling for leaving the EU. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=920.3000000000001s)]
*  And that is in line, I think, with what their populations by polling all over many years [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=923.46s)]
*  seems to indicate. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=929.2600000000001s)]
*  Let me ask a little bit about the differences if there are even any non-trivial ones between [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=931.1s)]
*  right-wing populist parties throughout Europe, other than, again, the ADF. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=937.22s)]
*  As you might know, I live in Brazil. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=942.62s)]
*  I lived in Brazil for a long time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=944.3s)]
*  My husband was a member of the Brazilian Congress. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=945.74s)]
*  I became very involved in Brazilian politics. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=947.3s)]
*  And I remember when Jair Bolsonaro was first running for president and then it began looking [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=949.3s)]
*  like he would win. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=952.9s)]
*  The American press labeled him the Trump of the tropics. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=954.74s)]
*  And although I understood why, they kind of needed shorthand to convey to Americans who [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=957.3s)]
*  this person was. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=961.22s)]
*  And there were some obvious similarities stylistically. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=962.66s)]
*  I remember Jair Bolsonaro clearly was copying Trump strategically and rhetorically in a lot of ways. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=965.86s)]
*  It was driving me crazy because in reality, their ideology is so radically different in [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=969.3000000000001s)]
*  so many ways. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=973.86s)]
*  Bolsonaro is kind of this throwback to the Cold War right, obsessed with communism, very, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=974.86s)]
*  very focused on social conservatism in a way that Trump isn't. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=979.34s)]
*  And you know, those differences get lost because it's hard to convey the nuances. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=982.62s)]
*  What about in the EU, again, other than Germany? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=987.46s)]
*  Is there some kind of very common connective ideological tissue that connects these parties [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=991.58s)]
*  in a way that makes their the local parts of them almost trivial? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=997.62s)]
*  So the parties do vary quite a bit by country, as you would imagine. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1006.5s)]
*  As you said, you know, sort of it was wrong to conflate Bolsonaro with Trump. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1010.1s)]
*  It's wrong to conflate Gert Wilders with Marine Le Pen. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1013.62s)]
*  But sure, there are some similarities. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1016.74s)]
*  I would say one thing that really does differentiate most, not all, but most of these right wing [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1018.9399999999999s)]
*  populist parties from their counterpart in the U.S., if you want to throw Trump and the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1024.62s)]
*  Republicans in there, is that these parties, most of them move to the left on economic [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1029.74s)]
*  issues a generation or two ago. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1034.98s)]
*  So Marine Le Pen's party is not a far right party on economic issues. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1037.3s)]
*  Her father was. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1042.1s)]
*  He was a Thatcherite or a Reaganite. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1043.1s)]
*  But she is a center or center left figure, as is her party on economic issues. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1045.58s)]
*  She sells the party very much as the champion of the left behinds, whether you agree that [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1052.58s)]
*  that's true or not is irrelevant. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1057.4199999999998s)]
*  That's that's how she presents herself. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1058.9399999999998s)]
*  And that's where her policies on economics, the Sweden Democrats, Sweden criticized the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1061.02s)]
*  Social Democrats for having abandoned, you know, their defense of the welfare state. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1066.78s)]
*  These parties are really quite different from their American counterparts on economic issues. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1071.98s)]
*  You know, they do have some connective tissue. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1078.9s)]
*  I would say their their their issue, the issue that they are most associated with is immigration [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1080.9s)]
*  and their opposition to it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1086.3400000000001s)]
*  And having changed the way that opposition is phrased over the years, having moved away [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1089.18s)]
*  from sort of direct racial or xenophobic opposition to immigration to claiming in any case that [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1093.94s)]
*  their opposition to immigration is based on a purported unwillingness by immigrants to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1100.1s)]
*  assimilate and conflicts over economic resources, whether that's true or not. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1105.62s)]
*  That is what they say. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1112.34s)]
*  And that is clearly a connective tissue among almost all these parties. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1113.96s)]
*  Again, with the caveat that there are some like the AFD and certainly the East European [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1118.26s)]
*  counterparts, which I would put in a separate category that are really not on these issues [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1123.34s)]
*  than the mainstream, if you can call it that now, far right populist parties in Western Europe are. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1128.94s)]
*  One of the, I think, really fascinating aspects of these election results, especially in the [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1135.18s)]
*  two biggest and most important countries, France and Germany, is just how kind of segregated [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1141.98s)]
*  and separate the various political groups are not unlike, I think, the United States, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1147.02s)]
*  where the vast middle of the country in the South are hardcore red states and then the, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1151.66s)]
*  coastal states are blue states. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1155.98s)]
*  If you look at the German map of the voting, I think we have this on the screen, what you see is that the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1159.1000000000001s)]
*  AFD's popularity was overwhelmingly from what was once called East Germany. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1164.78s)]
*  In fact, I think they were pretty by a good distance the most popular party if you just looked [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1171.18s)]
*  at East Germany and they had a lot less support in Western Germany, especially in Western cities. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1176.3000000000002s)]
*  What explains the ADF's extraordinary popularity compared to the other parties in East Germany? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1183.5s)]
*  So that's right, I mean the AFD is exceptional in a number of ways and in the German context, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1191.82s)]
*  it's exceptional because it still retains a very, very heavy Eastern base. Its support has expanded [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1196.86s)]
*  somewhat to the Western parts of Germany, but it remains a party that is disproportionately [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1204.06s)]
*  successful in the East. In fact, it is the most popular party in many of those Eastern states [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1208.62s)]
*  and that is because folks in those states, A, have a very different history than folks in the West. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1213.8999999999999s)]
*  They did not live through West Germany's post-war history, the reckoning with the Nazi past, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1219.6599999999999s)]
*  the democratic norms that developed during that time, and they also feel very much still like they [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1225.58s)]
*  have been sort of, to use a common term, left behind over the past decades or two, that you know, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1231.26s)]
*  these are regions that have suffered a lot of emigration. They are regions that still remain, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1238.22s)]
*  to some degree, poorer than the West. And so this is a place where anti-establishment [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1243.82s)]
*  kinds of voices gain much more resonance than they do in the West. But that map is really [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1251.66s)]
*  quite telling. But note that in West Germany, the most popular party, the plurality, not the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1259.26s)]
*  majority party, is the very traditional center-right CDU-CSU. Right, that was on [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1265.5s)]
*  Gold-Merkel's party, for example. Just to tie this a little bit to the United States, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1272.3s)]
*  and it's over simplification, I realize, but I think there's a lot of validity to it, which is [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1278.46s)]
*  that in these places that are kind of far from the nation's capital and far from the concentrated [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1283.66s)]
*  centers of power like Wall Street and Silicon Valley, there is a very strong perception, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1290.78s)]
*  the anti-establishment sentiment comes from this notion that the people in power basically [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1295.34s)]
*  harbor contempt for the beliefs and values, but also the material interests of all these people [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1301.26s)]
*  in the middle of the country who have this anti-establishment sentiment. Is that true [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1307.34s)]
*  as well in the EU writ large and in East Germany specifically? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1312.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. That kind of resentment at highly educated cosmopolitan elites is a central part of [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1316.94s)]
*  the appeal of these parties. So in the German case, for instance, again, I'll pick that one, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1327.18s)]
*  even though it has some exceptional qualities. The AFD's main target is always the Greens, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1332.46s)]
*  not so much the Social Democrats, the sort of traditional, albeit now really diminished party [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1338.46s)]
*  of the sort of working class, but the Greens, right? Why? Because the Greens are the party of [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1343.58s)]
*  the highly educated cosmopolitan urban elites. So they make a very strong effort to kind of [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1348.3s)]
*  constantly attack the Greens and their policies. They say that they are out of touch. They don't [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1356.06s)]
*  care about the quote unquote sort of average people. And so if you could imagine the United [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1361.9s)]
*  States with a proportional representation as opposed to a majoritarian electoral system like [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1367.82s)]
*  we have, the Greens would be the party of the sort of educated elites living in [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1373.5s)]
*  in university towns, that kind of thing. So you see this very much play itself out in Europe. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1381.4199999999998s)]
*  It's just that these people have now segregated themselves in different parties as opposed to [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1387.74s)]
*  being clumped together into big ones as they are in the United States. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1392.06s)]
*  Let me ask you a similar question about France where it seems to me at least, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1396.46s)]
*  having not studied this nearly as in depth as you to put that mildly, that there is a similar [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1400.6200000000001s)]
*  dynamic, especially when it comes to the United States. So I think the conventional was in the [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1405.74s)]
*  United States is that the Democratic party is becoming much more the party of affluent [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1411.66s)]
*  suburbanites and wealthy centers of power, lots of exceptions obviously, whereas the Republicans [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1417.1s)]
*  are really trying to become, let's call it the party of a multiracial working class, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1422.06s)]
*  not just the white working class, but the multiracial working class. But you can't really [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1426.54s)]
*  say that poor people in general have been in the Democratic party because there's a lot of [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1430.46s)]
*  very poor people for all kinds of different non-economic reasons, including race, who [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1434.7s)]
*  traditionally vote Democrat. There was this interesting passage from an article in The [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1439.1799999999998s)]
*  Guardian, and this is September, 2023, obviously before yesterday's election, by Julia Cage and [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1443.82s)]
*  Thomas Piketty trying to explain French politics from that perspective of who it is that is [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1449.02s)]
*  anti-establishment and in favor of Marine Independent, who still supports Macron. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  And they said the following, quote, the French political landscape can be described as follows, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1457.98s)]
*  low income urban voters who tend to be mainly service industry employees and tenants vote [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1463.34s)]
*  prominently for the left while working class voters outside the main cities who are mainly [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1468.78s)]
*  blue collar workers and homeowners are more likely to vote for parties of the far right. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1473.5s)]
*  If that's true, if you agree with that, how is it that kind of working class people who, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1478.94s)]
*  at least in the United States, the Democratic party always claimed to represent, obviously the [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1486.22s)]
*  EU party, the British party is called the Labor party, how is it that so many of these working [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1491.3400000000001s)]
*  class voters are now turning to the far right because they believe they represent their interests? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1495.5s)]
*  Well, we see, as you noted, a very similar dynamic in the US, right? So the white working [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1499.34s)]
*  class, if we stick to just the white working class vote in the US, is also, right? So the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1506.3799999999999s)]
*  Republican party is disproportionately supporting working class votes from folks who are living in [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1511.4199999999998s)]
*  non-urban areas and evangelical voters, right? If you are to look at sort of white working class [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1516.6999999999998s)]
*  voters who are secular, who live in whatever, New York or Los Angeles, those folks still have a [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1523.58s)]
*  fairly strong tendency to vote for the Democratic party. But so then the question becomes, well, why? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1528.38s)]
*  Why do we see the tendency of, you know, whatever low income, low educated voters and others to vote [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1534.7s)]
*  for, you know, these right wing populist parties? I mean, we could go back to the issues that you [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1541.3400000000001s)]
*  brought up at the beginning. I mean, I think they are applicable generally, right? People who have [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1546.46s)]
*  economic and social and cultural grievances. I would say when you're looking at working class [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1550.8600000000001s)]
*  voters, though, the other thing to throw in is the changing profile of the left, right? Which is [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1555.34s)]
*  these people, you know, a generation ago would have disproportionately voted for in Europe, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1561.34s)]
*  as Piketty and his colleagues say, they would have voted for whatever socialist parties, labor [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1566.62s)]
*  parties, social democratic parties. Those parties now no longer have those voters at all. They really [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1571.1799999999998s)]
*  lost them gradually over time. And then suddenly for the 90s, when they really kind of abandoned [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1576.4599999999998s)]
*  their traditional economic profile and ran headlong to embrace a kind of softer, gentler [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1583.82s)]
*  version of neoliberalism, right? What was called third way politics in Europe or progressive [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1590.62s)]
*  neoliberalism in the United States. And what you see after that is that working class voters no [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1595.26s)]
*  longer see these left wing parties as standing for them as their champions, as their natural, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1600.3s)]
*  so to speak, political homes. And so, you know, these parties no longer have the ability to capture [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1605.9s)]
*  or attract particularly these working class voters the way they would have during the [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1611.82s)]
*  post-war decades. And so those voters were particularly up for grabs. And now in Western [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1616.78s)]
*  Europe, even more so than in the United States, I would add, many of these right wing populist [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1622.7s)]
*  parties are the largest working class parties in their countries. That is to say the parties that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1627.1799999999998s)]
*  receive a plurality, sometimes more of working class votes. Yeah, it's fascinating. And same in [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1632.3s)]
*  Brazil where you have all these left wing parties and politicians who speak incessantly [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1638.54s)]
*  about representing the poor people and the working class and yet all their votes and donations come [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1643.26s)]
*  from highly educated, primarily white sectors of the city and the country. There's this big [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1647.8999999999999s)]
*  breach between the left on the one hand and the people they claim to represent on the other [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1652.86s)]
*  throughout the democratic world. I want to ask you about that because we've been spending time [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1656.46s)]
*  and we usually do another context as well when we talk about how hatred toward or dissatisfaction [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1661.1s)]
*  with establishment centers of power lead to right wing populism. And of course the question is [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1667.18s)]
*  why can't it lead to left wing populism or at least why isn't it? And there are some figures [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1672.8600000000001s)]
*  in Europe who I find really interesting. One of whom is the longtime German leftist Sarah [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1677.74s)]
*  Bagenknecht. We've had her on our show several times and interviewed her who basically went to [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1684.54s)]
*  war with the left of which she was always a part. In fact, one of the you could call her the leader [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1689.8200000000002s)]
*  of the left in Germany if you wanted. And she basically split from the left over things like [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1693.8999999999999s)]
*  attacking them over an obsession with very kind of academic and obscure cultural issues that alienate [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1699.4199999999998s)]
*  ordinary people. Not necessarily because they're hostile to it but because they don't find it [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1706.22s)]
*  relevant to their lives. She's become more anti-immigrant for sure. She's against the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1711.02s)]
*  war in Ukraine and NATO and institutionalist policies and she started a new party. It just [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1715.4199999999998s)]
*  got almost 6% won six seats in the EU. A fairly decent showing. But then you even have [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1719.9s)]
*  in Slovakia the prime minister who just got almost killed and assassinated Robert Fischer [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1725.3400000000001s)]
*  who was a long time left liberal of the very mainstream kind who also did a similar trajectory [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1731.66s)]
*  against immigration, against the war in Ukraine. And then you could kind of put maybe Jean-Luc [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1736.6200000000001s)]
*  Mélenchon in France in that pile as well though with lots of differences. Is there any real [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1741.9s)]
*  viable path for the left to capitalize on populism and anti-establishment sentiment using [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1749.1000000000001s)]
*  this sort of politics? Well, I will say that especially since you're based in Brazil, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1755.5s)]
*  you know that left-wing populism is the standard or the more popular so to speak form of populism [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1763.34s)]
*  historically in Latin America. So the fact that we're talking about right-wing populism because [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1769.18s)]
*  we're focused on sort of the aftermath of the European elections, that makes perfect sense [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1773.98s)]
*  because that is the dominant form of populism in Europe and indeed the West today. But it's not the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1777.82s)]
*  only form of populism although that term is really very broad so one wants to be careful what means [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1783.4199999999998s)]
*  when one says it. But you know generally when one talks about left-wing populism there are many parts [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1788.7s)]
*  of the world where that would be again the dominant form of populism and historically that [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1793.8999999999999s)]
*  was indeed the case in Latin America. We recently had an election in Mexico where a party that many [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1798.78s)]
*  people consider to be a left-wing populist party, you know its presidential candidate [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1803.82s)]
*  one and one hand. To get back to the question of why, I mean look there's a lot of reasons for that. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1808.86s)]
*  Figures like Wagenknecht and Melisheun, they are problematic for a variety of reasons for voters [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1813.98s)]
*  which you know you may or may not want to discuss further but I would say a lot of this does really [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1820.3s)]
*  actually sorry to interrupt but I would love to hear a little bit about that actually. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1825.8999999999999s)]
*  So look if you look at Wagenknecht she has been a better noir for both parts you know many parts of [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1830.3799999999999s)]
*  the left for you know a generation now and I think there's a lot of distrust of her and her motives [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1837.74s)]
*  both on you know among mainstream parties and of course among now her former colleagues in [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1844.9399999999998s)]
*  DeLinka. The particular package that she is trying to put together which is not just you know far [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1851.34s)]
*  left on economic issues but also really very conservative on a variety of social and cultural [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1857.5s)]
*  issues. She is very much if you look for instance at the votes for the EU election which they now [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1864.78s)]
*  have out you can watch the vote streams she's really trying to and did pull a significant [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1869.58s)]
*  number of votes from the AFD. Now that may be good because she is certainly more of a small [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1876.14s)]
*  D Democrat I would say than the AFD is but it does give you some sense of what kind of profile she is [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1881.66s)]
*  giving to voters and why therefore that might be of somewhat limited reach. I think there is a strong [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1889.42s)]
*  there is a very strong plurality perhaps even majority support for limiting let's say immigration [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1898.22s)]
*  in Germany particularly illegal immigration but dog whistling towards some of the things that I [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1904.62s)]
*  think folks think she is that to make some people nervous so that perhaps part is you know going on [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1910.54s)]
*  there with her. This is all super illuminating I just have a couple more questions that I respect [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1919.82s)]
*  for your time I actually have a ton more but I'm just gonna ask a couple more. Ursula von der Leyen [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1924.1399999999999s)]
*  who is the president of the EU is seeking a new term reelection of five years and it is interesting [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1931.98s)]
*  that we're spending so much time talking about this growing anti-establishment sentiment when [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1939.66s)]
*  to me in so many ways she's kind of like the living breathing embodiment of establishment politics [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1943.5s)]
*  not only in her ideological beliefs but just in her kind of trajectory and her comportment all [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1949.42s)]
*  of that she's like you couldn't invent in a lab a more establishment politician than she. What do you [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1954.6200000000001s)]
*  even though these status quo mainstream parties do have a majority it's not much bigger than [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1960.3799999999999s)]
*  the amount of votes she needs do you regard her reelection as close to certain or is there a decent [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1965.6599999999999s)]
*  chance that she won't be able to get those votes? So she I mean as you mentioned the coalition that [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1971.58s)]
*  had supported her in the past is somewhat diminished but still has the votes in parliament [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1978.22s)]
*  to elect her but you know these coalitions are not completely stable right so before the election [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1985.02s)]
*  she was already kind of you know making nice with Maloney in particular who has been [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1992.54s)]
*  you know a fairly strong supporter of the EU you know fairly strong supporter of the EU's efforts [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=1998.14s)]
*  in Ukraine and elsewhere and so she's clearly understands that as is the case in national [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2005.18s)]
*  parliaments as the party spectrum has fragmented it's no longer enough to kind of get the support [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2012.7s)]
*  of the mainstream parties behind you right so you want to have some sort of insurance policy so to [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2021.3400000000001s)]
*  speak so if she could potentially rely on support from some of those far-right parties that are seen [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2027.18s)]
*  to have moderated that would give her an alternative way of passing policies that she might not be able [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2034.46s)]
*  to get support for otherwise so for instance the green the green section of the EU parliament said [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2041.18s)]
*  they simply will not under any circumstances work with far-right parties so if she is trying to pass [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2046.0600000000002s)]
*  something that for instance she cannot get support from the greens on you know she may have no choice [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2052.46s)]
*  but to look to parties in that kind of you know whatever you want to call it far-right grouping [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2059.26s)]
*  in particularly what is going to be contentious going forward is that green new deal because the [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2065.5s)]
*  green parties really did suffer a significant loss of this election and those environmental [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2070.06s)]
*  policies have been the subject of some very serious national level protests farmers protests [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2075.58s)]
*  things like that so figuring out what to do about that is going to be a major challenge for her [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2080.7s)]
*  going ahead so you mentioned Ukraine i just want to ask you about that because the german green [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2085.5s)]
*  party for example is one of the most vocal supporters of nato and u.s financing of this [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2090.7799999999997s)]
*  war prolonging the war and yet and so is vendor lane she's been steadfast in in her views on that [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2095.74s)]
*  but it seems like a common thread of almost all of these right-wing parties is growing opposition [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2104.54s)]
*  to involvement in the war in ukraine for whatever their motives i mentioned robert fischow in [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2110.22s)]
*  slovakia who really ran on a platform of ending support for ukraine even though slovakia with [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2115.3399999999997s)]
*  its proximity to russia has been so pro ukraine what do you see the role of that war and opposition [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2119.98s)]
*  to continuing its involve nato's involvement in it to have been a factor in this in this election [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2127.5s)]
*  so the part there are some parties as you mentioned like um fico in slovakia that have been very wary [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2134.3s)]
*  indeed opposed to continuing support for ukraine obviously um you know orban is the kind of you [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2141.42s)]
*  know cheerleader of this particular group that particular position is less popular in western [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2147.74s)]
*  europe as you know has been mentioned already miloney is sort of you know whatever on board with [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2155.74s)]
*  supporting the uh supporting support for ukraine um the even marin lapin's party is kind of now [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2160.9399999999996s)]
*  relatively neutral on that whereas before you know she had been accused of being a sort of you know [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2169.66s)]
*  closet putin supporter that does not go along with her desire to moderate her party so that [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2175.5s)]
*  has essentially disappeared from you know sort of prominence in her platform the scandinavians are [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2181.42s)]
*  pretty hysterical about russia because it's on their border so you know there are definitely [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2188.06s)]
*  part parties that are wary of that and and the the person that you mentioned before sarah baghran [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2194.62s)]
*  connect would be a great example of that right she has been along with the afd the most prominent [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2200.14s)]
*  voice for rolling back support for ukraine trying to push for a ceasefire you know that kind of [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2206.54s)]
*  thing and i would say in the german context that does put along with the comments that i mentioned [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2214.2999999999997s)]
*  earlier in a very specific slice of the german electorate um you know that that might that might [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2219.02s)]
*  limit her ability to attract more votes from the let's say mainstream left all right my last question [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2225.34s)]
*  um just quickly uh president mccrone in response to this election dissolved the legislature the [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2231.42s)]
*  parliament and called for snap elections it kind of seems counterintuitive right after an election [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2237.34s)]
*  where your own party gets crushed to then want to have another election i'm sure he's very well [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2242.2200000000003s)]
*  aware of that uh that question and has good motives for doing so what are those motives what is he [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2247.34s)]
*  hoping to achieve with these elections well um i'm a political science professor i am not uh uh [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2253.18s)]
*  you know i do not have a crystal ball so i do not know what was going on in his mind i will say [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2260.7799999999997s)]
*  that is quite a um risky move that he had made that he made he did not need to do this um why [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2265.18s)]
*  he did this i again i cannot see inside his head so i will try to um you know sort of conjecture as [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2272.54s)]
*  best as possible he is a risk taker and has a lot of faith in his ability i think to [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2279.26s)]
*  convince the electorate that he is the best choice and that the national rally represents [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2286.38s)]
*  a bad choice i think he is hoping to be able to once again as he has in the past although with [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2291.5800000000004s)]
*  diminishing effectiveness over time rally all the pro-republican what you might call in the [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2297.5800000000004s)]
*  united states pro-democrat small d democrat forces behind him when it comes to a choice between [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2303.58s)]
*  you know sort of allowing the national rally to gain a dominant place in the parliament and [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2310.2999999999997s)]
*  therefore to be able to name the prime minister i think he thinks that he can still convince people [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2315.9s)]
*  that that would be a bad idea but you know as the quote that i think you put up earlier in the [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2320.94s)]
*  broadcast says should he lose that bet he himself does not um lose the presidency he is a [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2326.7s)]
*  president who was elected independently he will have to cohabitate with um the prime minister from [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2334.14s)]
*  um the national rally most presumably jordan bartella and um you know that won't be the first [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2340.54s)]
*  time that has happened he is somewhat paying a price for having a party that is a party [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2345.8999999999996s)]
*  more in name only it is really a vehicle for him individually and he does not you know it [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2351.1s)]
*  does not have a platform or a profile significantly separate from him so insofar as people are fed up [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2356.38s)]
*  with him you know his party is going to pay that price professor berman this is super illuminating [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2362.46s)]
*  so refreshing after being subjected to days of american punditry that has a knowledge of [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqnaTPj5oU&t=2368.54s)]
