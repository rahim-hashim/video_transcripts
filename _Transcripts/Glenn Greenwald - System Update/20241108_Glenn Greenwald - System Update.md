# Dems Should "Abolish Racism": Election Analysis With Lee Fang
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk)
*  Liefang is a longtime investigative journalist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=0.0s)]
*  He spent many years as my colleague at The Intercept. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=9.48s)]
*  He now writes most of his work and publishes the results of most of his investigations [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=13.42s)]
*  on his excellent sub-stack page, which I highly recommend. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=18.82s)]
*  We've had him on the show many times before to talk about the things he's uncovered through [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=22.12s)]
*  shoelace investigative reporting. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=27.78s)]
*  He also is a contributing writer at the British journal UnHerd, and we are always happy to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=30.02s)]
*  see him and speak with him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=34.7s)]
*  Liefang, good evening. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=36.54s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=37.54s)]
*  Liefang seems to be a little frozen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=41.78s)]
*  So first of all, I wanted to ask you, I think it's so interesting because you're somebody [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=44.7s)]
*  who in your investigative journalism spends a lot of time following money. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=48.64s)]
*  That's I think one of the things you do best. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=51.86s)]
*  And so often elections are about money and who is able to attract the most amount of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=54.38s)]
*  donors, the most amount of resources. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=60.02s)]
*  And yet here we just had an election in which Kamala Harris's campaign out raised the Trump [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  campaign by a factor of three to four and outspent the Trump campaign in every single [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=68.38000000000001s)]
*  one of the seven swing states, oftentimes by five or six times what Trump spent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  And yet Trump ended up winning every single one of those swing states despite the massive [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=80.83999999999999s)]
*  disadvantage in fundraising. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=86.32s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=88.24s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=89.24s)]
*  Well, there are many ways to look at a candidate and how they shape and control the media. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=90.24s)]
*  The reason that candidates raise money and super PACs engage in independent expenditures [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  is primarily the purchase of advertisements generating paid messages to a targeted voter [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=105.02s)]
*  base. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=112.86s)]
*  In this campaign, yes, the Kamala campaign raised more. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=113.86s)]
*  Her main super PACs, including the FF, Future Forward PAC, also out raised the Trump super [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  PACs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=125.3s)]
*  But there is one big kind of glaring dynamic that kind of puts a wrinkle in all of this, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=126.3s)]
*  and that's Elon Musk. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=133.82s)]
*  Elon Musk owns Twitter. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=135.42s)]
*  I think there's very compelling evidence that users who did not follow Elon Musk or follow [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=139.18s)]
*  any Trump accounts, if they followed anything political, they opened the platform on their [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=145.34s)]
*  phone or their desktop, they saw pro-Trump messages. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  They saw Elon Musk messages. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=154.06s)]
*  They saw messages backing the kind of Republican narrative. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=155.62s)]
*  Is that equivalent to a super PAC? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=159.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=162.34s)]
*  It's certainly legal what Elon Musk did. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=163.86s)]
*  But in terms of just shaping what voters saw and the entire media landscape, there wasn't [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=166.82s)]
*  something equivalent for Kamala Harris. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  Of course, there are many media outlets vulnerable to Kamala Harris, but it's not really the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=177.28s)]
*  same in terms of how most Americans receive their daily news now from social media. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=183.22s)]
*  They stare at social media. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=189.9s)]
*  Americans are not reading the New York Times on a daily basis. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=191.34s)]
*  They're not watching MSNBC and these other kind of pro-Kamala Harris media organs. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=195.38s)]
*  They're mostly just scrolling their phones. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=201.02s)]
*  So if there's one of the major media platforms that is biased in any way, that can be a significant [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=203.22s)]
*  factor in terms of media coverage. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  I take your point in that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=213.06s)]
*  The only thing I would add and push back on a little bit is that of the major social media [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=215.18s)]
*  platforms, Facebook and YouTube and Instagram and several others in fact, they're all bigger [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=220.78s)]
*  than X. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=228.86s)]
*  I think X, the latest statistics are that something like 18% of Americans ever go on [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=230.78s)]
*  X, even have an account on X. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=237.14s)]
*  I think the influence of X comes from the fact that that's where so many media and political [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=239.7s)]
*  professionals congregate. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=244.5s)]
*  And so it kind of punches above its weight in terms of broader narratives. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=246.54s)]
*  But in terms of directly reaching voters, X has and always has been one of the smallest [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=250.54s)]
*  of these social media companies when it comes to the amount of reach it has. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=256.58s)]
*  And I think we've seen... [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  And I would just add that TikTok and Facebook were very careful in this election to deter [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  media links. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  On Facebook in particular, they changed the algorithm to make it very difficult to just [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  share any kind of news link. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=281.02s)]
*  And given the kind of disastrous effects of censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=283.14s)]
*  2020, Facebook was very mindful of actually deamplifying political content. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=290.66s)]
*  I haven't seen a neutral analysis that shows that Facebook or TikTok was weighting their [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=298.18s)]
*  algorithm in support of either of the candidates. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=305.18s)]
*  They really kind of attempted to steer clear. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  And if anything, TikTok in particular moved to censor pro-Palestinian kind of content [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=310.5s)]
*  that was critical of Israel in a very aggressive way that might have actually shaped some left-wing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=319.58s)]
*  messages. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=325.54s)]
*  It's true that Twitter is a smaller platform in comparison, but this was a very pivotal [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=327.54s)]
*  platform in that this is where a lot of the political memes were not suppressed in any [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=334.86s)]
*  way. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=338.94s)]
*  This is where political content was being created and shared on other platforms. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=339.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=343.54s)]
*  So just so you know, we created a much, I think, cooler kind of vibe for your frozen [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=344.54s)]
*  image. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=350.98s)]
*  It's one that matches the ethos of our show. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=351.98s)]
*  So you can look forward to both seeing your initially contemplative view and then the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=355.34s)]
*  one that we've created for you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=360.34s)]
*  But we'll just continue. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=361.78s)]
*  Lee, let me ask you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=362.78s)]
*  One of the things I think is so interesting is that every time Democrats lose, and it's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=365.17999999999995s)]
*  true for Republicans as well, but I think Republicans do tend to have more self-critique [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=370.53999999999996s)]
*  when Mitt Romney lost a very winnable election to Barack Obama, that all these kind of autopsies [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=375.97999999999996s)]
*  and recommendations about what they needed to do to appeal to a younger audience, including [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=381.94s)]
*  using software language on immigration. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=386.5s)]
*  Trump, of course, came in 2016 and ripped the whole book apart and ignored it all and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=388.74s)]
*  did the opposite and won. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=392.78s)]
*  But they did try to look at what isn't wrong about our party. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=394.62s)]
*  One of the things that amazes me about Democrats is that they immediately start looking for [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=397.98s)]
*  everyone to blame other than the candidate in the party and especially the consultant [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=403.78s)]
*  class, which as you said, when a campaign like Hummel-Harris's raises in excess of a [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  billion dollars, these consultants who make their ads, tell them advice, get a percentage [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=415.97999999999996s)]
*  of all the money spent, these people make tens of millions of dollars and their job [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=421.5s)]
*  is to, they only have one job, which is to ensure that the candidate wins. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=426.46s)]
*  And you had all throughout the day on liberal outlets and social media and even in interviews, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=432.58s)]
*  basically blaming the voter, saying, well, voters are stupid, voters are bigoted, Trump [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=439.5s)]
*  offered terrible things, apparently this is what voters like because this is the kind [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=445.22s)]
*  of country that we have. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=448.54s)]
*  And there's almost never any introspection about what the candidate did wrong or especially [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=449.54s)]
*  what this consultant class did wrong in the messaging that ended up being so ineffective [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=456.06s)]
*  despite how much money they make. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=461.06s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about that aspect of our elections where these consultants make [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=463.58s)]
*  so much money and seem to always evade any critical scrutiny at all? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=469.02s)]
*  Well, look, I had readers to my sub stack forward on text messages that they were receiving [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=473.38s)]
*  into the evening yesterday on election day, urging them to donate $20, $50, $100 to stop [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=480.22s)]
*  Donald Trump in Pennsylvania to protect reproductive rights. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=487.66s)]
*  If they didn't donate immediately, that Donald Trump would ban abortion forever and that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=491.38000000000005s)]
*  he must be stopped in Pennsylvania. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=495.82000000000005s)]
*  This was going on just maybe an hour before the polls closed. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=497.74s)]
*  How these dollars, if the recipients had actually donated, would actually make any difference [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=501.54s)]
*  either way is kind of implausible. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=507.54s)]
*  But given this organization, I started peeling back the layers of the onion, this organization, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=510.1s)]
*  Pro-Choice America 2024 was founded earlier this year. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=517.3399999999999s)]
*  It claims to be a pro-democrat, pro-Kamala Harris pack. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=521.3399999999999s)]
*  In fact, it's given no money to the Kamala Harris campaign. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=525.8199999999999s)]
*  It's provided no independent expenditures in Pennsylvania on the presidential race or [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=530.14s)]
*  in any other battleground state. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=533.9399999999999s)]
*  Instead, hundreds of thousands of dollars were funneled to this Democrat consulting [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=535.74s)]
*  firm Mothership Strategies. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=540.9399999999999s)]
*  After publishing this story this morning, other readers have sent me other urgent appeals. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=545.14s)]
*  They're still spamming their supporters to fundraising lists and text lists, really exploiting [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=549.34s)]
*  a loophole in the TCPA. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=556.38s)]
*  There are spam text regulations that prevent most marketers from just taking your name [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=559.3000000000001s)]
*  from a list and just sending constant updates to your phone. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=566.38s)]
*  But there's a loophole, a carve out for political messaging. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=569.46s)]
*  These consultants ruthlessly exploit this loophole. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=572.62s)]
*  They send lots of political texts. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=577.3399999999999s)]
*  They claim to be helping on some hot button issues. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=578.98s)]
*  The same consultants run similar packs on abortion rights, gun rights, various people [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=583.42s)]
*  of color defending democracy, a support list chain, a variety of Democrat causes. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=590.54s)]
*  But you go pack after pack after pack, the money doesn't actually go into the election [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=596.4599999999999s)]
*  system. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=602.5s)]
*  It goes into the pocketbooks of these Democratic fundraising consultants, text messaging consultants, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=603.5s)]
*  other kind of online marketing consultants. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=609.1s)]
*  In fact, just this afternoon a few people were texting me about my story. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=612.02s)]
*  I looked up a few of the consultants that were responsible for these text messages. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=617.06s)]
*  They just recently purchased about a $3 million home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  They have another $3 million home they just purchased in Northwest Washington, D.C. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=628.22s)]
*  They're getting rich off this campaign fundraising dynamic. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=632.46s)]
*  For the Kamala Harris campaign broadly, this is a candidate who, along with Joe Biden, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=635.54s)]
*  supported Jamie Harrison for DNC chair. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=642.02s)]
*  This is a corporate lobbyist for Lockheed Martin and a variety of other financial and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=643.98s)]
*  energy interests. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=648.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris' chair for running the Chicago convention, Minyon Moore, runs a lobbying [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=650.14s)]
*  firm, is a partner in a lobbying firm called Dewey Square Group that really specializes [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=657.1s)]
*  in corporate lobbying and AstroTurf lobbying for a variety of business interests. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=661.98s)]
*  You look down the line, the person advising her biggest super PAC, Anita Dunn, and Eskadi [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=667.38s)]
*  Knickerbacher, this is someone who's advised a variety of the Fortune 100, even Pfizer. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=672.78s)]
*  This consulting class that ran the campaign, that kind of inundated voters with messages, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=678.98s)]
*  that was advising the candidate, that was literally chairing the convention, these are [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=686.18s)]
*  the people that are lobbyists, that benefit from money and politics. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=689.98s)]
*  They're very disconnected from the lives of regular people. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=695.42s)]
*  They don't have a particularly great track record, and even running political campaigns, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=697.98s)]
*  win or lose, they seem to profit. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=702.18s)]
*  Yeah, not that he's immune, but this is clearly what Trump meant when he ran up, especially [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=704.18s)]
*  in 2016, against what he called the D.C. swamp. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=708.78s)]
*  Then he made very clear he was bipartisan. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=711.42s)]
*  Let me ask you, we covered some of the extraordinary numbers of non-white voters who migrated from [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=714.74s)]
*  the Democrats to Trump, and it's been a trend that's been going on for a while, but you [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=721.74s)]
*  see it in this race, even more than you have in previous ones. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=725.7s)]
*  One of the things you wrote on Twitter today was, quote, Dems can reform with one easy [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=730.66s)]
*  step, abolish racism. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=735.78s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=738.18s)]
*  The party has been beset for a very long time, but this is a problem that has accelerated [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=741.2s)]
*  over the last 10 to 12 years with identity politics, with this kind of crude division [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=746.8000000000001s)]
*  of human beings based on superficial differences on the basis of skin color, of ethnic origin, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=753.5400000000001s)]
*  on gender identity. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=761.5600000000001s)]
*  You see this at the Democratic Party. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=764.12s)]
*  You saw the white guys, the white dudes for Kamala, black men for Kamala. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=765.84s)]
*  In Congress, the Democratic Party, unlike the Republican Party, has very influential [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  and powerful caucuses based on race, the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Asian Caucus, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=776.34s)]
*  Congressional Black Caucus, of course. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=783.1800000000001s)]
*  You see it in the way that the party formulates its leadership, the way that primaries are [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=785.1s)]
*  run when a candidate emerges to challenge an incumbent or to run for office. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=792.76s)]
*  Immediately, they're run through the wringer of race and identity. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=800.96s)]
*  You see this kind of scrutiny not based on experience, not based on values, not based [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  on principles, and certainly not based on policies. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=810.38s)]
*  Rather, it's based on these tribalistic differences that really don't match the reality of the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=812.88s)]
*  human experience or the American experience. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=822.16s)]
*  I think this election really just blows away the assumptions behind this form of politics [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=824.56s)]
*  that is percolated in the Democratic Party. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=829.18s)]
*  Rather than constantly caucusing and segregating based on race and ethnicity, the Democratic [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=831.76s)]
*  Party should return to the simple value working class and kind of looking at the experiences [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=836.88s)]
*  of people who are struggling. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=844.6s)]
*  It's a party that historically has stood for change, has stood for challenging the establishment. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=845.8s)]
*  Instead, it's become the establishment. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=851.16s)]
*  It's become a party of money at its least. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=853.24s)]
*  Instead of working for real vulnerable communities, they kind of manufacture them with this obsession [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=856.06s)]
*  over race and identity. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=863.04s)]
*  It's just very simple. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  Rather than constantly obsessing over identity and skin color, the party could majorly reform [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  itself by simply getting rid of all these caucuses, getting rid of all these clubs, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=874.4s)]
*  getting rid of all these institutions that are based on separating people based on skin [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=878.24s)]
*  color. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think we see, again, this kind of class breach because if you look at the people [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  brought onto television or brought onto the New York Times or newspaper op-ed sections [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=889.96s)]
*  to write about these things, they very much see the world through this identity politics [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  lens in part because, again, they're not very deprived with or concerned about class issues [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  but that is not how the vast majority of working class people think who have a lot more in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=909.12s)]
*  common with one another than they do with some sort of attempt to divide them up by [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=913.4399999999999s)]
*  race. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=918.1999999999999s)]
*  This is what, as I said earlier, some of the smarter Republicans like Josh Hawley and JD [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=919.1999999999999s)]
*  Vance have been talking about for a long time, which is that the future of the Republican [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=923.8399999999999s)]
*  Party is a multiracial working class coalition because ultimately, increasingly, that is [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=927.0799999999999s)]
*  how people are perceiving their role in American life, not based on their race or their gender [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=934.12s)]
*  or their sexual orientation but based on their material needs, which sounds so basic but [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=939.12s)]
*  you have this whole layer of Democratic Party elites and media allies and NGOs who just [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=944.64s)]
*  cannot see the world that way. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  Everything they do depends on this dividing up of everybody and you see how increasingly [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=950.88s)]
*  ineffective it is. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=957.22s)]
*  All right, Lee, well, thank you so much for taking the time to come on. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=958.22s)]
*  I really wish we could have seen you yourself on the screen actually moving around with [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=962.6s)]
*  your natural movements instead of the weird kind of Max Headroom TV effects we use for [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=966.12s)]
*  you but people have seen you enough, I think, on my show so we'll certainly have you on [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=970.88s)]
*  in more human form next time. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=974.52s)]
*  Appreciate you having me, Glenn. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  Take care. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=978.8s)]
*  Always good to talk to you, Lee. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJRZd7bvBTk&t=979.8s)]
