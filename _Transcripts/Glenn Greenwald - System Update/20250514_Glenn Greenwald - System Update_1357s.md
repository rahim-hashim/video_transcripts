# Trump DISMANTLES DC Foreign Policy Dogma?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY)
*  Donald Trump landed in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia early this morning to begin a trip that we've [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=0.0s)]
*  been talking about on this show that's notable in part because he's visiting three different [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=11.96s)]
*  countries, three different tyrannies in the Gulf region. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=15.96s)]
*  And even though he's very close to Israel, he doesn't have any plan to go visit Israel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=20.04s)]
*  or Netanyahu. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=23.88s)]
*  But he also announced beforehand that he's going to do deals with these countries even [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  though Biden had put a prerequisite that they have to first go and normalize relations with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=30.14s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=36.12s)]
*  And the position of these countries was, we're not going to normalize relations with Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=37.12s)]
*  We can't. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=40.44s)]
*  Until they give the Palestinians a state. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=42.08s)]
*  And obviously, not only are they not going to give the Palestinians a state, they're [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=43.96s)]
*  ethnically cleansing Gaza and killing huge numbers of people in the process to achieve [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=47.94s)]
*  that goal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=52.2s)]
*  So obviously, they can't normalize relations with Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=53.44s)]
*  So Trump said, all right, I'm going to put America's interests first rather than Israel's. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  And he didn't just make the trip. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  He also announced what the White House in a release earlier today called a historic [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  $600 billion investment commitment in Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=69.68s)]
*  Donald J. Trump secures historic $600 billion investment commitment. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=74.52s)]
*  Now the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who's effectively the de facto leader of that country, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=80.08s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman, went and met Trump at the airport just to kind of underscore the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=87.8s)]
*  importance of this trip. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=93.52s)]
*  And then after those two signed agreements between Saudi Arabia and the United States, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=95.72s)]
*  they entered this massive, gigantic, ornate auditorium where it looked like a couple thousand, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=100.0s)]
*  maybe several thousand people were speaking. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=108.24s)]
*  And Trump received a massive standing ovation from the Saudis, but also a bunch of corporate [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  interests and financiers who are very interested in opening up the doors to do business in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=117.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia because of how much money they have. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  And here's how Donald Trump was received. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=123.16s)]
*  There's Mohammed bin Salman clapping, holding his heart. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=125.28s)]
*  There you see this massive auditorium. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=138.56s)]
*  There's Elon Musk right behind Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=143.24s)]
*  And they're just clapping and clapping and clapping. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=146.16s)]
*  And then Mohammed bin Salman stands up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=151.36s)]
*  So of course the entire auditorium instantly does to give Trump a standing ovation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  So and there's Marco Rubio as well. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  So you see how Trump is viewing Saudi Arabia as just a transactional economic lens that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=165.16s)]
*  there's huge amounts of benefits for American companies and for the United States and for [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  the Trump family to pursue in Saudi Arabia, which is drowning in all kinds of petrodollars [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=180.2s)]
*  and is seeking to diversify their investments and to create a more positive image of themselves [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=185.04s)]
*  in the world, even if they're not necessarily loosening up any part of the tyranny of their country. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=191.76s)]
*  Here is an excerpt of something Donald Trump said in that speech. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=199.72s)]
*  In this speech he kind of laid out a vision. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  He first talked about all the great things happening in the United States under his presidency, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=206.72s)]
*  the normal things, closing the border, the tariffs and the stock market and all of that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=211.92s)]
*  But then he got to foreign policy and specifically talked about the region. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=218.68s)]
*  Now there's a lot in this speech that is kind of a continuation of the way things are seen [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=221.92s)]
*  by the United States in terms of foreign policy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=227.92s)]
*  He spent a lot of time bashing Iran as the source of all evil in the Middle East, but [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=229.72s)]
*  in large part because Saudi Arabia and Iran are very, very violent enemies. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  It's kind of the arch rivalry of the Middle East. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  Part of it is religious, part of it is just strategic. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  So of course Trump did bash Iran a lot, claiming that they were one of the major problems of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  the Middle East, but he also said, we hope to sign an agreement with Iran so that they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  can thrive, just not without a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=256.96s)]
*  But he also attacked bipartisan foreign policy dogma that has prevailed in the United States [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=260.24s)]
*  for a long time and specifically neocons and interventionists. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=268.24s)]
*  Here's part of what he said. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=271.92s)]
*  And it's crucial for the wider world to know this great transformation has not come from [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  Western interventionists or flying people in beautiful planes giving you lectures on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  how to live and how to govern your own affairs. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=291.96s)]
*  No, the gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=301.52s)]
*  dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=308.68s)]
*  Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=315.68s)]
*  themselves, the people that are right here, the people that have lived here all their [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=321.76s)]
*  lives, developing your own sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions and charting [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=325.28s)]
*  your own destinies in your own way. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=331.36s)]
*  It's really incredible what you've done. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=338.24s)]
*  the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=342.64s)]
*  themselves. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=350.76s)]
*  They told you how to do it, but they had no idea how to do it themselves. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=351.76s)]
*  Peace, prosperity and progress ultimately came not from a radical rejection of your [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=355.56s)]
*  heritage, but rather from embracing your national traditions and embracing that same [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=361.48s)]
*  heritage that you love so dear. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  So he's essentially saying we've been trying for decades to interfere in your countries. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=371.44s)]
*  We come and give you lectures about what you should and shouldn't do, meaning like, hey, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  you probably should loosen up the tyranny a bit. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=383.24s)]
*  But mostly he's saying this whole hubris of the United States and its neoconsent interventionists, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=388.2s)]
*  that we have the right to go around the world remaking other countries in our image when [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=394.0s)]
*  we don't even know the slightest things about these complex countries and it's all been [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=397.64s)]
*  a failure. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=401.12s)]
*  As he said, these nation builders have destroyed more countries than they've built and that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=402.12s)]
*  from now on you have to figure out your own national identity. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=408.32s)]
*  It's not for us to decide. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=412.44s)]
*  And you're going to thrive not because we tell you what to do or change your country, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=414.96s)]
*  but because you are figuring out what you want your country to be and that's why we [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=420.0s)]
*  see all these buildings popping up. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=423.28s)]
*  So basically I think it's important to realize that Trump is not jettisoning all of the vision [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=427.76s)]
*  of foreign policy that the US bipartisan classes had for decades about the Middle East. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  He's saying basically Iran is the main problem, they're the source of the terrorists and that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=442.72s)]
*  basically the whole Middle East can become like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=450.88s)]
*  He left out Qatar because there's some conflict but he's going to say the same thing in Qatar. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=459.76s)]
*  Doha is very similar. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  You have all these glitzy buildings and all these like, I mean, they look, those cities [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=465.64s)]
*  do. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=471.24s)]
*  Certainly Doha, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Riyadh look far more futuristic and far more developed [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=472.24s)]
*  than most cities in the United States. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=480.48s)]
*  And so he's saying the Middle East should be like this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=483.88s)]
*  Who cares if there's no democracy? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=487.52s)]
*  That's kind of a side point. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=491.32s)]
*  This is the model of the Middle East. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=493.64s)]
*  So basically Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joining together in order [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=495.36s)]
*  to live peacefully side by side and do business with one another. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=501.92s)]
*  And then all you have to do is just get rid of in his mind the people who are primitive, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=508.0s)]
*  warmongers who want to keep the region in instability and fighting, namely Hamas and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=512.52s)]
*  Hezbollah and the Houthis and Iran. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=517.92s)]
*  So it's not a very encouraging picture in the sense that he's certainly not coming and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=523.66s)]
*  saying we got to get out of here completely. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=527.78s)]
*  He's saying we still need to wipe out these factions. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=530.86s)]
*  Obviously, it doesn't include any sense of a Palestinian state. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=533.3399999999999s)]
*  Remember, Trump basically talked about Gaza and said, yeah, we got to get all the people [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=539.2199999999999s)]
*  out there and then we're going to basically build it to be like Dubai. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=543.54s)]
*  There's going to be casinos and resorts. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=546.42s)]
*  That's his vision. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=549.42s)]
*  Anyone who's been to these places, and I've been to Dubai and Doha several times, Abu [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=551.38s)]
*  Dhabi, it is true. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=558.4599999999999s)]
*  There's enormous amounts of wealth there. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=561.02s)]
*  And it's kind of like a playground for the world's rich. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  And if you have a lot of money, there's a lot of things to do there that are enjoyable. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=569.5s)]
*  There's everything just kind of ornate and ostentatious. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=573.62s)]
*  I always felt very uncomfortable feeling there because that glitz is for a tiny amount of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  the elites. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=587.42s)]
*  And then the rest of these places are like slave labor with no rights, very few labor [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=588.42s)]

*  So many people died when Doha had the World Cup. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=595.62s)]
*  Because of how they're treated, most of them are imported from other places to do the work. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=601.14s)]
*  You have all these rules, rigid rules, social rules about, say, homosexuality is punishable [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=605.7800000000001s)]
*  by prison. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=611.6600000000001s)]
*  And that is true for the ordinary people who live there. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=613.1800000000001s)]
*  But the elite of Dubai, trust me, it's like being in Greenwich Village in the 1970s or [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=615.98s)]
*  West Hollywood now. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=623.94s)]
*  There's tons of homosexuality because that's how this country is set up. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=625.1400000000001s)]
*  You have this tiny little class of extreme wealth here and the rest of the country there. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=631.46s)]
*  And this is Trump's model for the Middle East. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=635.14s)]
*  He's saying, we want you to export technology, not terrorism. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=636.62s)]
*  Here's part of what he said about Gaza. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=641.66s)]
*  The people of Gaza deserve a much better future. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=644.06s)]
*  But that will. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=648.46s)]
*  So that's they heard that as a pro-Palestinian statement, like, hey, Gaza deserves much [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=656.02s)]
*  better. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=659.9s)]
*  And obviously they're thinking, yeah, meaning like Israel needs to stop destroying all their [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=660.66s)]
*  society and engaging in genocide. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=665.22s)]
*  But that's not what Trump means. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=666.74s)]
*  Which is true of what he just said. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=685.62s)]
*  But notice how he places all the blame on Hamas, saying everything's going to be fine [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=686.9s)]
*  once we destroy Hamas, which he thinks is what Israel is doing. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=691.38s)]
*  Here is Trump making an interesting, with an interesting passage on how he sees Iran. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=695.22s)]
*  And he offers some generalized observations about having enemies in the world. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=703.26s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=709.26s)]
*  That's a really interesting passage. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=716.9s)]
*  Interesting concept because both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson warned about that exactly. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=746.9s)]
*  Washington in his farewell address, Thomas Jefferson in his second inaugural address [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=755.9s)]
*  said the United States has to avoid entangling alliances such as tying ourselves to Israel [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=760.14s)]
*  and being constrained by this alliance with this other country that just goes on forever. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=768.9s)]
*  But also they warned about enduring enmities, enduring conflict with another country. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=775.66s)]
*  And that's Trump's taking that, there was a very non-interventionist, both of those by [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=780.9399999999999s)]
*  Washington and Jefferson were very non-interventionist views of what the role of the United States [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=784.6999999999999s)]
*  should be in the world. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=790.2199999999999s)]
*  We're not an empire, we're a republic. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=791.2199999999999s)]
*  We don't go around looking for enemies or looking for allies, trying to dominate the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=792.74s)]
*  world. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=797.3s)]
*  We'll defend ourselves, obviously, we have to like we just did when we gained our independence. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=798.3s)]
*  But the vision they laid out was not one that where you have US bases all over the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=802.38s)]
*  world where you're acting as empire, where you're constantly at war and Trump is taking [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=806.86s)]
*  that language. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=811.3s)]
*  I don't know, I assume whoever wrote this speech is very well aware of that. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=812.3s)]
*  And he's saying, yeah, people don't understand that about me. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=816.74s)]
*  I don't want to have enemies. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=819.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't want to have enduring enemies. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=820.9399999999999s)]
*  I want to avoid war. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=822.54s)]
*  Permanent enemies. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=825.9s)]
*  I am different than a lot of people think. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=826.9s)]
*  I don't like permanent enemies, but sometimes you need enemies to do the job and you have [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=829.58s)]
*  to do it right. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=835.38s)]
*  Enemies get you motivated. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=837.22s)]
*  In fact, some of the closest friends of the United States of America are nations we fought [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=838.22s)]
*  wars against in generations past and now they're our friends and our allies. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=843.98s)]
*  I want to make a deal with Iran. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=850.58s)]
*  If I can make a deal with Iran, I'll be very happy if we're going to make your region and [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=852.38s)]
*  the world a safer place. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=857.58s)]
*  But if Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=859.26s)]
*  then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure, drive Iranian oil [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=864.58s)]
*  exports to zero like I did before. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=871.8199999999999s)]
*  If you know that, they were a virtually bankrupt country because of what I did. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=875.3s)]
*  They had no money for terror. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=882.58s)]
*  They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah and take all action required to stop the regime [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=884.06s)]
*  from ever having a nuclear weapon. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=890.02s)]
*  Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=893.66s)]
*  So this is what he's been emphasizing. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=902.0999999999999s)]
*  Even with Iran, we want to get a deal done with Iran. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=904.9s)]
*  We don't want to be in a war with Iran and Trump is doing everything possible to get [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=907.42s)]
*  a deal with them. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=914.6999999999999s)]
*  Here is one more clip from Trump that I just want to show you that where he lays out a [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=917.14s)]
*  foreign policy vision. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=922.38s)]
*  Five thousand people, young people for the most part, soldiers. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=924.26s)]
*  He's talking here about his attempts to end the war in Ukraine and to facilitate peace [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=929.78s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=935.22s)]
*  Five thousand people, young people for the most part, soldiers from Ukraine, soldiers [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=937.5799999999999s)]
*  from Russia. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=944.02s)]
*  They're not from here and they're not from the United States, but their souls, their [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=945.02s)]
*  souls I think usually mostly they're young beautiful souls that left their parents waving [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=949.42s)]
*  goodbye, left their brothers and sisters. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=955.02s)]
*  Goodbye, I'll see you soon. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=957.5799999999999s)]
*  They got blown to pieces. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=960.18s)]
*  Five thousand on average a week are dying and people are dying elsewhere in the region, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=962.5s)]
*  but tremendous numbers like we haven't seen since World War II are dying and I want to [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=969.02s)]
*  stop it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=975.62s)]
*  I want to stop it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=976.62s)]
*  It's a horrible war. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=977.78s)]
*  It would have never happened if I was like it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=978.78s)]
*  So I always want to give this word of caution when we talk about Trump's vision of foreign [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=981.78s)]
*  policy and the rejection of neoconservatism and the idea of using war as a constant tool [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=989.98s)]
*  including for nation building that there's not going to be any complete adherence to [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=995.1400000000001s)]
*  that vision. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1000.94s)]
*  I mean the bombing of the Houthis is a perfect example where Trump just decided to bomb the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1001.94s)]
*  Houthis which Biden was doing throughout 2024, but and there's a lengthy New York Times article [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1008.3000000000001s)]
*  detailing this which I would recommend. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1015.58s)]
*  The reason why Trump decided to stop it was because he was getting reports from the military [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1017.82s)]
*  that it was basically failing. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1024.98s)]
*  Here's the New York Times article. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1026.94s)]
*  It's entitled Why Trump Suddenly Declared Victory Over the Houthi Militia which is from [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1028.76s)]
*  yesterday and it basically describes how he was getting reports from the military that [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1033.8200000000002s)]
*  They hadn't even gained air superiority that in the last week American fighter jets, the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1040.9s)]
*  most sophisticated in the world, came very close to being blown out of the sky by Houthi [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1047.9s)]
*  missiles and there were F-16s that fell into the water, two of them at least from the Harry [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1052.38s)]
*  S. Truman naval ship that is like the centerpiece of the U.S. Navy and at the same time they [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1061.38s)]
*  were using so many precision missiles just one after the next after the next that the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1072.7s)]
*  military was warning that we were depleting our own stockpiles such that we wouldn't even [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1079.2600000000002s)]
*  be able to defend Taiwan for example. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1083.8400000000001s)]
*  We were just depleting it so much and Trump realized that all the things he was told about [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1086.42s)]
*  the U.S. military's ability to destroy Yemen wasn't happening. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1091.86s)]
*  Instead this was just going to be another endless Middle East bombing campaign that [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1095.34s)]
*  ultimately produced very little benefit. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1100.18s)]
*  The Houthis were putting their stuff underground as they always do. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1102.78s)]
*  They get more resilient and so he just found a way to declare victory and stopped it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1105.94s)]
*  That is an action that reflects this new vision and at the same time Trump is obviously [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1111.86s)]
*  in favor of and still funding and arming the Israelis as they destroy Gaza, hasn't really [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1120.62s)]
*  said a word about that although he is trying to demand that the Israelis negotiate with [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1124.54s)]
*  Hamas in Qatar and he's obviously trying to stop the war in Ukraine with Russia and he's [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1130.6999999999998s)]
*  trying to get a deal with Iran. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1137.82s)]
*  So you know sometimes when you say this, the minute Trump drops a bomb or if they get into [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1139.02s)]
*  any kind of bombing campaign with Iran people are going to say, oh look you were fooled, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1146.98s)]
*  you were deceived, you fell for this scam. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1150.34s)]
*  So I'm not saying that this is some fundamentally different vision of foreign policy but it [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1156.02s)]
*  is significantly different directionally in the sense that Trump is repeatedly emphasizing [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1160.78s)]
*  he wants to have the biggest military but he doesn't want to use it and the purpose [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1169.5s)]
*  of it is to deter wars, to make sure wars don't happen and he's saying that's what [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1174.42s)]
*  he wants his legacy to be, he ran as a peacemaker. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1181.42s)]
*  That's why I was so disappointed when he started bombing Yemen because I was like, this is [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1186.06s)]
*  exactly what we were promised he wouldn't do. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1190.3799999999999s)]
*  In fact he criticized Biden for having done it in 2024 bombing Yemen and he was like, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1192.18s)]
*  you don't have to bomb Yemen, you just pick up the phone and solve it diplomatically, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1196.42s)]
*  we showed you that many times and then suddenly Trump is back to a new bombing campaign in [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1198.98s)]
*  the Middle East but he also ended it after a month because he started realizing this [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1203.74s)]
*  isn't producing anything. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1209.66s)]
*  So hopefully all this pressure that we brought to bear on him, that is being brought to bear [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1213.3s)]
*  on him to enter new wars including with Iran as well as to continue funding Ukraine by [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1218.74s)]
*  blaming Russia saying, oh Russia proved they don't want to stop the war, there's a lot [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeafBlf4qY&t=1226.74s)]
