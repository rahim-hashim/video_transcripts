# Scandal Rocks Streaming Worldâ€”What Is This Subculture?  w/ the Vanguard
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs)
*  One of the primary objectives of our program is something I have always encouraged my readers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=0.0s)]
*  to do and my viewers to do and something that I try very hard to do myself is to make sure [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=11.96s)]
*  that I am exposing myself to the best of every political ideology and political viewpoint [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=16.52s)]
*  that I can possibly find to try and find the smartest, most informed people who represent [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  every political ideology so that you can, even if you're completely certain of the core [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=27.96s)]
*  values that shape your politics, subject it to as much challenge and as much dispute as [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=32.88s)]
*  you can because at the end of the day that will either lead you to question what you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=38.2s)]
*  believe in a way that you probably should be questioning it or it will fortify your [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=41.92s)]
*  convictions because you've subjected it to the best possible challenge. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=45.36s)]
*  And I think it's important to note that it's not enough to say, oh, I'm going to read [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=49.68s)]
*  some conservatives and some liberals or some people on the right or the left. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=52.88s)]
*  There's a lot of different variants as we just covered with the difference between, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=56.32s)]
*  say, Ben Shapiro or Candice Cohen or Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson when it comes to things [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=60.12s)]
*  like how to view the U.S. security state and U.S. foreign policy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=65.0s)]
*  And there's also a lot of gradation as well between older people and what kind of political [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=67.84s)]
*  content they consume and what younger people consume. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=72.68s)]
*  There's, for example, if you say, oh, I'm going to try and expose myself to the right, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=75.44s)]
*  there's a big difference between, say, National Review and let's say the Charlie Kirk show. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=78.8s)]
*  They're both nominally part of right-wing media, but you would get very different views [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=83.6s)]
*  and very different ways of getting them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=86.6s)]
*  One of the programs that I most like to watch that is a program that is increasingly popular [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=89.08s)]
*  among young online leftists is a YouTube show called The Vanguard. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=96.28s)]
*  I've talked about it before. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=100.96s)]
*  I've been on their show several times. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=101.96s)]
*  It is hosted by two very smart and very entertaining and very well-informed, thoughtful people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=104.28s)]
*  One of them, Gavin Charles, who is a co-host of The Vanguard, is with us tonight in order [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  to talk about this somewhat tawdry and creepy scandal that has emerged within this subculture [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=116.84s)]
*  of online left-liberal political streaming. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=123.2s)]
*  We want to spend a lot more time talking about what this subculture is and what it kind of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=125.72s)]
*  says about how young Americans are getting their news and forming communities than on [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=129.46s)]
*  the top and on the scandal itself. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=134.32s)]
*  But we do have to spend a little bit of time on that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=136.16s)]
*  Gavin has done a lot of great reporting on it, and we are delighted to welcome you, Gavin, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=138.0s)]
*  to your debut episode appearance, which I hope won't be your last, on System Updates. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=142.0s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=146.52s)]
*  Well, thank you so much, Glenn. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=147.52s)]
*  Really appreciate the intro. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=150.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's great to be here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=151.32s)]
*  This is a perfect topic to have me on to unpack, I think. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=152.58s)]
*  We've spent a lot of time in the trenches of online lefty discourse and done a lot of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=155.6s)]
*  videos and debates with Vash himself, one of the people we're going to be discussing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=160.72s)]
*  tonight. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=164.24s)]
*  Yeah, once again, thank you so much for the invite, Glenn. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=165.24s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=167.24s)]
*  Yeah, so let me just give you kind of my background. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=168.24s)]
*  I've been aware for a while of this kind of left liberal streaming, which I kind of differentiate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=170.84s)]
*  even from, say, a show like yours where you go on the air, you go on a few times a week. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=176.96s)]
*  I don't know exactly how long your show are, but I think you have like a two hour, two [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  and a half hour live stream, and then you have kind of segments where people consume [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=185.12s)]
*  it in 15 or 20 minute segments on YouTube. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=188.9s)]
*  To me, these kind of left liberal streamers are different because one of the things that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  kind of shocked me and I became familiar mostly with Destiny because over the past few months [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=196.44s)]
*  I debated him twice, once as part of a group and then as part of a one on one, is that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=200.82s)]
*  these people spend seven, eight, 10 hours literally every single day streaming about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=205.3s)]
*  every single part of their life. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=213.46s)]
*  They have a very significant audience. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=214.76s)]
*  Mostly I think of young people who nominally share their politics. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=217.46s)]
*  And I want to talk about that culture, that subculture and how it kind of is evolving [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=220.46s)]
*  and what its characteristics are. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=225.34s)]
*  But before we do, the reason why a lot of people are paying attention out to this subculture [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=227.54s)]
*  is that there is a scandal involving, I think you could say fairly that there are three [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=231.06s)]
*  kind of leading people who occupy this space. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=235.66s)]
*  Hassan Piker, who's Jen Kiger's nephew, Destiny, and then this person who calls himself Vash. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=238.58s)]
*  And Vash recently had this scandal where he exposed unintentionally his pornography file [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  and among the images he kept on his computer appeared to be some animated images involving [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=252.22s)]
*  underage girls. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=258.5s)]
*  So tell us who Vash is and why people who haven't heard of him before should know of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=259.5s)]
*  him and what this scandal is in kind of a summary way. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=266.62s)]
*  Yeah, well thank you so much for the intro. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=269.78s)]
*  And Vash is an interesting character. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=272.74s)]
*  He's someone that Zach and I have debated a few times on our show, The Vanguard. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=274.78s)]
*  The first time we had him on, it was actually to debate US airstrikes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=279.1s)]
*  He was, I believe, defending extrajudicial murders by America for foreign Middle Eastern [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=283.74s)]
*  terrorists and the sort we were pushing back a little bit on that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=291.0s)]
*  The second time he was cheerleading the duopoly, basically arguing that everyone on the left [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=293.86s)]
*  needs to fall in line behind Joe Biden, we came on to defend the merits of voting third [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=299.62s)]
*  party, especially in an election season where Joe Biden and Donald Trump are going to be [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  our options. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=309.98s)]
*  Seemingly we were advocating for a third party vote, specifically the Green Party or Dr. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=310.98s)]
*  Cornel West. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=315.5s)]
*  Either way, he's a real servant of the duopoly, in my opinion, a real cheerleader of the Democrats [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=316.5s)]
*  specifically and someone who oftentimes pushes back on leftist foreign policy perspectives [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  despite claiming to be a socialist. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=329.74s)]
*  So he's an interesting guy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  We disagree with them a lot. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=334.02000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes we've agreed with him as well. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=335.5s)]
*  But recently he really made the news when, as you said, Glenn, he quite embarrassingly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=337.7s)]
*  revealed his porn stash to the audience, which didn't just contain the normal kind of pornography. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=342.34s)]
*  As you said, it also contained images of animated children, what's often referred to as lolly [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=348.98s)]
*  content. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=354.86s)]
*  And this opened up an entire can of worms that led to a lot of people finally condemning [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=355.86s)]
*  Vosch. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=361.02s)]
*  He's been a quite controversial figure on the online left, but this, I think, really [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=362.02s)]
*  was the last straw for many. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=367.29999999999995s)]
*  Luckily, most people in the space universally condemned this, called him out over it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=369.62s)]
*  And despite his repeated attempts to kind of gaslight and talk his way out of the situation, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=374.94s)]
*  as I said, luckily most people on the left condemned this, called him out over it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=381.06s)]
*  And I don't think he'll ever recover entirely. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=385.26s)]
*  As a streamer, you mentioned that he was one of the top three lefty streamers alongside [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=387.78s)]
*  Destiny and Hassan. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=392.34s)]
*  And while I would agree with that, up until this point, I think that there's definitely [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=393.9s)]
*  going to be a shift in the landscape going forward. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=398.02s)]
*  Because as I said, it's pretty hard for him to come back from this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  For sure. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  And as I said, people who want to really follow the gruesome details of exactly what happened [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  here, of how he tried to defend himself, can go and find a lot of people talking about [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=408.29999999999995s)]
*  this online. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=413.73999999999995s)]
*  People have written about it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=414.73999999999995s)]
*  Just to give a kind of visual component to what we're discussing here is a screenshot [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=416.62s)]
*  from Voss's channel that he called the context video, where he sort of tried to defend himself [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=421.26000000000005s)]
*  from these allegations and these concerns. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=426.06s)]
*  As I mentioned before, one of the things that I think is so notable is that there's the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=431.54s)]
*  political ethos of these streamers. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=440.06s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that historically in the United States, say for the last 100 [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=444.94s)]
*  years, younger people have tended to be more radical, have pursued a more radical politics. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=450.18s)]
*  That's true both on the left and I think you can even say on the right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  It's certainly since the 60s and the 70s where left-wing politics started coalescing around. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  Opposition to the Vietnam War drove the incumbent president, Lyndon Johnson, out of the presidency [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=466.26s)]
*  by making it possible for him to be re-nominated by refusing to support him because of opposition [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=471.21999999999997s)]
*  to the Vietnam War. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=476.46s)]
*  There hasn't been this sense of supporting the establishment in young leftist politics. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=477.46s)]
*  It's been this more outsider anti-establishment against the system ethos to politics. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=482.26s)]
*  Although you have, I guess, a kind of political gradation among this streaming community, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=488.5s)]
*  I would say Hassan Piker is probably more to the left and then you have Voss, who is [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=494.7s)]
*  kind of identifies as a socialist but certainly supports almost everything Biden does. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=500.5s)]
*  I mean, he was an opponent of the war in Israel but a big supporter of the NATO war in Ukraine [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=504.65999999999997s)]
*  and in general actually organizes to get people canvassing for Democratic Party voters and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=509.7s)]
*  for Joe Biden and then destiny is just a pure Democratic partisan hack. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=516.34s)]
*  And even Hassan, the most left-wing of them, at the end of the day will usually tell his [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=521.34s)]
*  young audience, go vote for the Democratic candidate even when it's somebody like Gavin [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=527.7s)]
*  Newsom in a very blue state of California. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=531.26s)]
*  He usually ends up devoting himself to the Democratic Party. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=533.1s)]
*  I'm curious as somebody who is part of that generation that these kinds of communities [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=537.1s)]
*  target and as someone who is not by any means a servant of the Democratic Party, in fact, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=543.82s)]
*  as you just said, you've often advocated abstaining from voting for Democrats or voting for third [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=548.46s)]
*  parties. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=552.46s)]
*  Do you think that the political ethos of your generation, at least this online component [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=553.74s)]
*  of it, is less radical and more kind of subservient to or captive of the Democratic Party establishment [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=559.74s)]
*  than previous younger generations have been? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=566.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's definitely interesting. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=569.6600000000001s)]
*  I think that specifically when it comes to Israel, we've seen a lot of people from my [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=572.58s)]
*  generation really breaking off from the Democratic establishment and kind of questioning whether [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=577.1s)]
*  or not these two options are actually the best for us. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=583.34s)]
*  But I think that you're definitely onto something specifically when it comes to this kind of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=586.1s)]
*  generation of streamers. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=590.74s)]
*  A lot of people refer to the space as BreadTube. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=592.0600000000001s)]
*  There's also a lot of folks on Twitch, which is an emerging platform hosting lots of live [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=595.14s)]
*  streamers from across the political spectrum. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  And you're absolutely right, Glenn, that there is this increasing reticence to call out American [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  intervention abroad, specifically with the Ukraine war. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=609.26s)]
*  I think we saw a lot of people that nominally claimed to be on the left coming down on suspiciously [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=613.54s)]
*  establishment sort of positions when it came to the funding of this war, when it came to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=620.5s)]
*  a pushback coming from real left-wing commentators like myself and Zach at the Vanguard people [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=625.18s)]
*  that were warning about what this renewed escalation, sorry, escalation with Russia [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=630.9799999999999s)]
*  could possibly lead to given the potential for nuclear exchange. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=636.86s)]
*  Right. And yeah, we saw a suspicious amount of cheerleading in the direction of basically [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=641.3000000000001s)]
*  just the establishment Democratic Party line, which is that we need to fund Ukraine more. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=647.1800000000001s)]
*  We need to give Zelensky everything he wants, a blank check, essentially consequences be [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=653.0600000000001s)]
*  damned. And not only was there this odd call to basically just adopt the Democratic Party [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=658.1s)]
*  line as it relates to this foreign policy issue, this incredibly complex foreign policy [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=664.38s)]
*  situation, not only that, but there was a lot of smearing of people who pushed back, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=668.86s)]
*  right, almost kind of harkening back to the era that I grew up in, the lead up to the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=673.38s)]
*  Iraq war, where people who were dissenting from America's invasion of Iraq were called [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=678.34s)]
*  unpatriotic and their loyalties were questioned. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=683.82s)]
*  It was frankly bizarre and shocking to me to see people like Destiny, to see people [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=687.02s)]
*  like Vash pulling some of those same moves on critics of America's involvement in this [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=692.22s)]
*  conflict and our continual funding of this proxy war. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=699.38s)]
*  I was completely shocked. To be fair, I think that Hassan Piker has done a much better job. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=702.82s)]
*  As you mentioned, Glenn, he's been pretty good on Palestine. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=707.62s)]
*  And, you know, actually, he's caught in some heat from guys like Vash and Destiny recently [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=710.9s)]
*  for pushing back on some of the logic revolving around America's position in Ukraine and kind [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=716.14s)]
*  of our role in general as the world police, something that we've pushed back on a lot [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=721.74s)]
*  and tried to remain staunch in as a fixture of Left YouTube. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=726.94s)]
*  I'll be very interested to see whether Hassan Piker tells his audience, despite telling [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=732.46s)]
*  them for months that Joe Biden is an enabler of genocide in Gaza, that despite all that, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=738.62s)]
*  it's now time for them to do their duty and go vote for Joe Biden. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=743.94s)]
*  And I want to kind of ask you about my hypothesis about this kind of feature of left-wing politics [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=749.4599999999999s)]
*  in the United States, especially as it's defined by, say, like, younger millennials and Gen Z [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=758.26s)]
*  voters, which is, you know, one of the... [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm not very familiar with the history of people like Vash and Destiny, but from my [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=764.66s)]
*  understanding, they were basically building up a streaming audience by more or less focusing [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=767.9799999999999s)]
*  almost entirely on video games and anime and, like, playing video games and talking about [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=772.54s)]
*  that and kind of started to become political with the emergence of Donald Trump. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=776.98s)]
*  And that's true of a huge number of Americans who were apolitical or didn't pay much attention [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=780.3800000000001s)]
*  prior to Trump and who really got convinced that Trump was this singular evil, this unprecedented [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=785.2600000000001s)]
*  threat to the United States and whose worldview is kind of singularly shaped by Donald Trump. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=790.3000000000001s)]
*  Like, it's the metric, the framework through which they understand everything. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=798.1800000000001s)]
*  So if there are people or institutions who seem aligned with the cause of defeating Donald [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=802.0600000000001s)]
*  Trump, people like neocons or the U.S. security state, the way Russiagate came from the CIA [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=808.2600000000001s)]
*  and the FBI, global institutions like NATO, things that the left had long, prior to Trump, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=812.58s)]
*  opposed, there's not really much opposition any longer to those political factions. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=820.1s)]
*  And in fact, there's a lot of hospitality among some of these left-wing factions, precisely [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=824.86s)]
*  because they seem like they're allies in the only political cause that matters, which is [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=831.14s)]
*  defeating Donald Trump. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=837.0600000000001s)]
*  Is that something you think explains this kind of strain of left-wing politics that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=838.14s)]
*  seems more captive to the Democratic Party and to some of these institutional power [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=842.94s)]
*  centers than previously? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=848.14s)]
*  I think that that definitely has something to do with it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=851.58s)]
*  I feel like most of the streamers we're talking about kind of got involved in politics more [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=854.34s)]
*  because of Bernie Sanders and the potential that he represented for the left rather as sort [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=858.98s)]
*  of a space to talk about Donald Trump. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=864.74s)]
*  That certainly came later. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=867.62s)]
*  But when we're talking about people like Destiny, Hassan and Vash, I would say that their content [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=869.38s)]
*  focused more originally on Bernie and his movement. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=874.9s)]
*  Of course, when that fizzled out, they had to go in other directions. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=878.66s)]
*  And yeah, of course, Trump has dominated so much of American discourse on the left and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=882.34s)]
*  right that it's pretty inescapable to talk about him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=887.5400000000001s)]
*  And you're right that it does give people an easy excuse to basically just propagandize on [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=891.0600000000001s)]
*  behalf of the Democratic Party and lead their audience back to that position over and over [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=897.0600000000001s)]
*  again. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=902.02s)]
*  And to be fair, in my own opinion, I think that there's some level of fairness behind that [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=902.6600000000001s)]
*  argument. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=908.02s)]
*  I'm definitely not a supporter of Donald Trump's. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=908.34s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=910.58s)]
*  We do see an increasing amount of trust in the deep state institutions, which are classically [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  distrusted by the real left. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=917.22s)]
*  So yeah, I do think that's probably part of the reason why we've seen these trends occur [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=919.94s)]
*  and part of the reason why we see a lot of these prominent voices on the left, such as [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=924.82s)]
*  Destiny just siding with the institutions of power, with the deep state. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=930.1800000000001s)]
*  I think Destiny specifically is probably the main one that you're spot on about, Glenn, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=934.1800000000001s)]
*  and his just total fealty to the deep state and the establishment. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=939.0600000000001s)]
*  He won't entertain any skepticism of the CIA or the FBI, for example. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=942.74s)]
*  So yeah, I think that's probably part of it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=948.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of polling data that shows that people who just identify as left liberals, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=950.34s)]
*  left people on the left, people who are liberals, adherents to the Democratic Party, just have a [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=954.5s)]
*  much higher opinion of the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department, prosecutors, foreign policy, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=958.1s)]
*  NATO, the Pentagon, than any kind of left-wing politics over generations previously. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=966.82s)]
*  You just see it in polling data, among other things. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=972.82s)]
*  One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you about this kind of streaming culture as something that [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=976.1s)]
*  seems to me to be a little different is, and here just to give you a kind of sense, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=980.9s)]
*  I think it is important to note that these streamers actually do command a pretty decent [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=986.34s)]
*  size audience. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=992.34s)]
*  I think for a lot of people under 30, these people have, these streamers have a lot more influence [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=994.1s)]
*  than a lot of recognized political brands. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=997.94s)]
*  Just recently, Ro Khanna, who, you know, is someone who tries to kind of be innovative in [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1000.1800000000001s)]
*  the way that he organizes both his own political brand and the Democratic Party, actually sat down [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1004.1s)]
*  with a bunch of different streamers, including Emma Vigeland, who's the co-host of The Majority [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1010.58s)]
*  Report, but also Vash, and here from Vash's stream, you can actually see it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1015.1400000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that really got me interested, as I said, was kind of looking a little bit more [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1020.9000000000001s)]
*  at what this subculture was as a result of my debating Destiny, and here, I don't know if you, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1024.66s)]
*  I don't think you can see it, Gavin, but here's just the last four days. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1030.1000000000001s)]
*  He's not, it's not like I picked some unusual or unrepresentative sector. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1034.26s)]
*  Here's just the last four days. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1040.02s)]
*  Every single day Destiny has streamed. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1041.78s)]
*  He streams every single day, and today he streamed for eight hours, yesterday for seven and a half [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1044.1000000000001s)]
*  hours, the day before that for seven and a half hours, the day before that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1050.42s)]
*  four and a half hours, and we have that up on the screen. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1054.4199999999998s)]
*  And there's a lot of studies now, a lot of data about the addiction of young people, of Gen Z, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1058.8999999999999s)]

*  problems. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1086.5s)]
*  There's data about how people who are under 30, Gen Z, are far more likely to have mental health [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1087.06s)]
*  pathologies like depression and anxiety, and this seems to me, these kind of streaming [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1093.7s)]
*  communities seem to be something different in kind than, say, the way people have related [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1098.98s)]
*  to celebrities or maybe even watch a show like Yours or Mine or watch a show that they like on [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1106.1s)]

*  There's kind of a feeling of intimacy from podcasts, but when you're spending eight hours [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1116.4199999999998s)]
*  every single day and your identity is formed around these online communities, and I saw a [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1121.4599999999998s)]
*  lot of this from Destiny's followers, this kind of like supreme allegiance, not to any political [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1126.5s)]
*  ideal, but to sort of him as a person into this community, it seems like these are starting to [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1131.3s)]
*  become kind of replacements for actual offline human connection. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1138.02s)]

*  friendship and communion and community, all things we need as human beings and social animals, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1156.26s)]

*  pornography and actual sex with somebody you love. Like pornography is kind of a facsimile of sex, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1165.7s)]
*  but it denies you a lot of the real connection. Same with online communities and friendship versus [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1172.42s)]
*  actual offline activities and the way it forces you to interact. Do you think that is a real problem [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1177.38s)]
*  for people of your age, the dependency on the internet, and are these streaming communities [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1184.9s)]
*  as kind of unhealthy as they seem to me as somebody who is not their target audience, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1189.86s)]
*  but who has begun kind of paying more attention to them over the last year or so? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1196.34s)]
*  It's a really interesting question, and I think that it's a bit of both, right? Like the internet [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1201.94s)]
*  in general, there are, of course, lots of pros and cons. I think that the pro of these sort of spaces [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1207.06s)]
*  is the robust conversations and debates that often do occur on them, right? For all of the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1213.54s)]
*  criticism I have of a guy like Destiny or a guy like Vosh, there are going to be a lot of interesting [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1219.22s)]
*  political debates you're going to have access to if you're watching Twitch shows like that or YouTube [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1224.5s)]
*  channels like that. And even though they can't go on for a really long time and get a bit monotonous, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1229.3799999999999s)]
*  specifically if you don't agree with the streamer in question, I still think it's one of the more [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1235.78s)]
*  substantive forms of entertainment that Gen Z is consuming. If you compare it to a lot of the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1240.74s)]
*  mindless drivel on Twitch or TikTok or even YouTube, I think that it's a good thing for [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1246.9s)]
*  people to be paying attention to these sorts of discussions, as aggressive as they might get. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1252.58s)]
*  Like I said, we've debated some seriously substantive issues with people like Vosh, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1257.38s)]
*  including the merits of third-party voting and American foreign policy. So it's not just a [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1262.18s)]
*  totally mindless area. But as I said, for every pro, there is definitely cons. And even though I [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1266.98s)]
*  think the probably vast majority of people who tune into someone like Destiny or Hassan, I think [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1274.26s)]
*  the vast majority of them are normal people who are just consuming the content in sort of clip form [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1279.7s)]
*  or they'll jump into the live stream for 30 minutes to an hour and kind of watch it as they might [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1285.8600000000001s)]
*  system update or the Vanguard. Obviously, you're going to get the people who also just, you know, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1290.74s)]
*  their life begins and ends there. And that's when the bizarre parasocial relationships begin [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1296.42s)]
*  to develop, something that we saw specifically with the Vosh controversy that we mentioned at [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1301.38s)]
*  the beginning of this conversation with him accidentally exposing the problematic containment [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1307.78s)]
*  of his, or rather what was contained within his porn folder. And all of a sudden there's all these [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1313.8600000000001s)]
*  channels and all of these kind of orbiters and Vosh super fans out there defending him and gaslighting [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1319.14s)]
*  the rest of us, those of us who had the obvious and normal reaction to what was in Vosh's folder. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1326.5s)]
*  And it's like, why would you be doing that? Why would you be devoting your time to defending [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1331.94s)]
*  such a bizarre aspect of this man who you don't know this person's life? And that's where the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1336.5s)]
*  parasocial stuff kicks in. That's where we get the people who just obsess over this and devote their [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1343.0600000000002s)]
*  whole life to becoming defenders of, like I said, people they don't even know. But ultimately, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1347.78s)]
*  is it any worse than the constant 24-7 cable news that is preferred by older generations? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1353.94s)]
*  I don't think so. I mean, if you think about it, previous generations had the radio, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1361.3s)]
*  which was almost always on. They could listen to that. And of course, cable news, CNN, Fox, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1365.8600000000001s)]
*  and all these other 24-7 live entertainment programs, all completely sponsored and captured [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1370.5800000000002s)]
*  by corporate interests. I don't think that tuning into streamers, even streamers like Destiny and [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1377.06s)]
*  Hassan, I don't think it's any worse than that. If anything, I find it to be more intellectually [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1382.9s)]
*  stimulating as you are getting exposed to viewpoints that aren't just the approved [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1388.5800000000002s)]
*  viewpoints that you can have on TV. Yeah. I mean, I totally agree with a lot of what you said. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1393.7800000000002s)]
*  I think if you're spending time engaged in political debate, and obviously one of the reasons I [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1399.94s)]
*  decided to debate Destiny was because I know he has a political audience that I wouldn't be able [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1404.74s)]
*  to reach, and I thought I wanted them to at least be exposed to those kinds of things. And [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1409.38s)]
*  I've heard Vash doing the same thing. But honestly, one of the things that kind of shocked me [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1413.7800000000002s)]
*  is when I began paying attention to Destiny, it was, I guess, right around the time when he was [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1418.3400000000001s)]
*  divorcing his wife. And I bring that up only because so much of his stream, while I was [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1424.18s)]
*  watching it to try and get a sense of what this community was, ended up being things like him [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1428.8200000000002s)]
*  actually just litigating his divorce for hours online, showing texts from his wife and [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1432.2600000000002s)]
*  messaging deeply personal and intimate things. And the scandal with Vash too didn't just come [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1439.7s)]
*  out of nowhere. It kind of is something that he has talked about his lot, his obsession with [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1445.38s)]
*  is a certain kind of pornography that is involving like anime drawings of animals and things like [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1450.3400000000001s)]
*  that. And it did just, and I guess the reason, in part, it's not really abstract to me, right? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1455.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm raising teenagers. I'm very aware of the dangers of just letting your kids stay online [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1463.38s)]
*  all day. And I also know there's this dynamic where everyone in an older generation looks at [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1468.5s)]
*  whatever is new of younger people and always kind of looks at it with a lot of skepticism [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1473.22s)]
*  and just like, oh, what are these kids doing? These things seem very unhealthy. And I'm very [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1478.9s)]
*  aware of that dynamic and trying to avoid it. At the same time, there is this data about this kind [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1483.22s)]
*  of explosion of mental health pathologies among people who are younger with all kinds of disorders [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1489.86s)]
*  that seem to me to be coming from somewhere. They have to have some kind of a source. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1497.3s)]
*  And if you look at the way in which the world changed and the way in which people's lives are [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1503.46s)]
*  lived, the main difference seems to me is that people who are born into a world in which the [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1507.46s)]
*  internet is the primary means by which we interact with one another and form relationships with one [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1513.06s)]
*  another and form communities with one another has to be having some kind of an impact on our [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1518.26s)]
*  mental health. So I don't mean to like paint with too much of a brush or suggest that there's [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1523.7s)]
*  nothing positive or healthy in these communities. But we're putting on this graph now that says, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1528.02s)]
*  over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems? Feeling [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1535.14s)]
*  nervous, anxious or on edge, feeling down, depressed or hopeless, thought that you would [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1539.06s)]
*  be better off dead or thought of hurting yourself in some way. And by far, people who are in Gen Z [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1543.14s)]
*  and younger millennials have a much higher incidence of self-reporting these kinds of [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1548.26s)]
*  mental health pathologies. I'm just wondering what you make of that at the extent to which, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1552.58s)]
*  and I don't just mean now to single out these specific streaming communities, but just the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1557.06s)]
*  over-reliance on online activity in lieu of meaningful interpersonal connection and the [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1561.54s)]
*  role that it might be playing in this kind of mental health crisis. Oh, yeah, I can certainly [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1568.26s)]
*  speak to that. I mean, as a member of Gen Z who's terminally online myself, I think that I even can [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1573.78s)]
*  notice a lot of the mental health effects that come with the territory of just being as terminally [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1579.46s)]
*  online as I am, not only because it's something I've always enjoyed, consuming this sort of [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1584.26s)]
*  political content and just being online a lot, but also now that I have to constantly be focusing on [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1588.98s)]
*  everything newsworthy for my job, it can definitely weigh you down. And you can start to just exist in [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1595.38s)]
*  this online echo chamber or bubble where all the news is bad news and everyone is constantly doom [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1602.34s)]
*  and gloom. And it can be refreshing just to go outside and be like, yeah, if it wasn't for the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1609.4599999999998s)]
*  online debates I'm embroiled in and the news cycles I'm paying such close attention to, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1616.4199999999998s)]
*  everything seems fine out here. The people are happy. The sun is shining. Life is going on as [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1622.1799999999998s)]
*  usual. But if you spend all day inside just doom scrolling Twitter or watching YouTube videos or [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1628.18s)]
*  live streams, it can result in this distorted view of the world that everything is constantly falling [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1635.0600000000002s)]
*  apart, that we're only five minutes from complete climate disaster or nuclear annihilation or [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1641.38s)]
*  whatever the media is talking about or fear mongering about sometimes justly. These are [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1648.8200000000002s)]
*  important things to be focused on, but when you hyper fixate on things and obsess on them and all [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1654.74s)]
*  you're hearing about is negativity, then I think that can absolutely result in a very distorted [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1659.94s)]
*  worldview that also of course comes with just the obvious unhealthy parts of being inside all day, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1667.3s)]
*  the lack of vitamin D, the lack of all this sort of interpersonal communication and relationship [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  that you're talking about that has largely been replaced by podcasts. So yeah, I think it's a [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1679.22s)]
*  huge problem, Glenn. It's a huge problem. And as much as I enjoy the online spaces and the [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1684.58s)]
*  sorts of conversations like the one we're having right now, which are made possible by the internet, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1690.42s)]
*  I think there's definitely a lot of cons as well. I'm really glad to have grown up right before [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1695.06s)]
*  the internet and cell phones just totally took over. Smartphones didn't really hit the mainstream [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1701.7s)]
*  until I was in about eighth or ninth grade. So while the internet has always been part of my [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBy92ZlZSs&t=1707.3s)]
