# Was Matt Gaetz's AG Nomination Sabotaged By The Media?: With Journalist Lee Fang
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo)
*  Let me just switch gears for a second and ask you just a little bit about Matt Gaetz, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=0.0s)]
*  even though he is no longer the nominee to run the Justice Department because he has [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=11.0s)]
*  withdrawn. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=16.44s)]
*  You wrote an article not about Matt Gaetz so much as, although it was about Matt Gaetz [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=17.44s)]
*  as well, but also more so about what you called the DC lobby and how intent they were on preventing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Matt Gaetz from becoming attorney general and how they were kind of coming for him to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=28.96s)]
*  destroy him, to prevent his nomination. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=34.32s)]
*  I think the title of that article from September was, or last month, yeah, it was the DC lobby [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  comes for, oh you know what, actually I'm sorry, it's from late 2023 after he sabotaged [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=43.32s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy and forced Kevin McCarthy out. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=50.88s)]
*  But so it was the DC lobby is coming for Matt Gaetz, so this is not part of the nomination [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=52.88s)]
*  but it was just sort of this lingering widespread hatred for him and this attempt to destroy [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=58.16s)]
*  him. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=62.4s)]
*  What did you mean by the DC lobby coming for Matt Gaetz and why were they doing that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=63.4s)]
*  Well, look, he is, it's very well known that he's hated by some of his colleagues and the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=67.92s)]
*  kind of tabloid beltway press like to play up the kind of little petty insults that happen [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=74.92s)]
*  on Capitol Hill, the little sub tweets that happen on social media. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=80.36s)]
*  That part's not particularly interesting to me. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=84.36s)]
*  What's interesting to me is that Matt Gaetz was the first House Republican and one of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=86.48s)]
*  the only House Republicans to jump on the kind of Bernie Sanders coded movement of getting [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=91.12s)]
*  rid of PAC donations, saying no to lobbyist donations, no to leadership PAC donations, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=96.76s)]
*  no to any of the kind of corporate money that sloshes around DC that funds both parties. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=102.06s)]
*  He's rebuked his party on many key votes, you know, fighting leadership on arms to Yemen, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  on, you know, he led the opposition earlier this year among Republicans on voting against [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, you know, encoding the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  which essentially outlaws or, you know, discourages a certain criticism of Israel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  He's fought with House progressives on non-compete agreements, on antitrust, on breaking up the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  big tech monopolies, on vote after vote on corporate copyright law and on many kind of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=141.56s)]
*  very esoteric issues that have to do with worker power and corporate power and anti-competitive [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=148.44s)]
*  policy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=153.88s)]
*  He's broken with the swamp, with the DC political leadership of the Republican Party, and that's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  upset a lot of the kind of established powers to be. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=162.12s)]
*  So, you know, that was kind of laid out in this piece from last year when he led the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=165.36s)]
*  revolt against Kevin McCarthy, but it's just as true today where you see a lot of the folks [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=171.36s)]
*  who were, you know, tweeting out and promoting anti-Matt Gaetz stories, promoting kind of, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=176.44000000000003s)]
*  you know, sexual allegations against Matt Gaetz. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=182.4s)]
*  If you actually looked at their bios, who are these people? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=185.52s)]
*  Several of them were working for the tech lobby, people who work at groups funded by [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=189.52s)]
*  Google. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=192.96s)]
*  Matt Gaetz has really led the effort to encourage the continued prosecution of Google under [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=194.08s)]
*  antitrust law. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=201.44s)]
*  He's praised what the Biden administration has done, you know, kind of picking up the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=203.0s)]
*  torch from what the Trump administration had started four years ago. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=206.84s)]
*  And that has made him a very hated man in Washington. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=211.08s)]
*  He walks around with a mark on his back, with a target on his back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=214.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=217.8s)]
*  He said, I love Lena Kahn. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=218.8s)]
*  But also, you know, he also has that same profile when it comes to foreign policy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=219.84s)]
*  He was adamant about the need to leave Afghanistan to cancel authorizations to use military force. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  I saw him at war with Liz Cheney on several occasions in the House over exactly these [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  kinds of issues, but also with pro-war Democrats. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=235.36s)]
*  He has a lot of heterodox views that are very counter to the swamps' dogma and ideology. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=237.8s)]
*  And so certainly at least part of the hatred toward him is motivated by exactly that, which [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=246.28s)]
*  is part of the reason why I thought that choice could have been so good in terms of outcome. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=250.8s)]
*  But I don't want to... [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=256.16s)]
*  I want to just talk about the sex scandal thing for a second. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=257.64s)]
*  And it's still... [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=260.44s)]
*  A lot of the details are still emerging. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=261.44s)]
*  We don't have the report yet that the health ethics committee prepared that's supposedly [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=263.18s)]
*  very damaging. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=268.72s)]
*  One thing that I do know for sure is that sex scandals are often the way that Washington [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  does try to destroy the people they want to destroy for totally separate reasons. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  I talked on Tucker Carlson's show about how the response to Daniel Alsberg leaking the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=282.0s)]
*  Pentagon Papers was to break into his psychoanalyst office precisely in order to discover his [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=285.48s)]
*  psychosexual secrets and leak them and use them to destroy his reputation. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=290.12s)]
*  It happened with Julian Assange. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=294.0s)]
*  At the moment, he became genuinely threatening. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=295.0s)]
*  Out of nowhere, two women came forward and said we had to consensual sex. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=297.0s)]
*  But I didn't consent to him not using a condom and that became rape under Swedish law which [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=299.88s)]
*  drove him into the embassy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, it was used against Bill Clinton and now it's being used against Pete Hegstad. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  And of course, this is the thing that has been used to destroy Matt Gaetz. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=310.32s)]
*  There's a lot of murkiness, a lot of murkiness on this issue, on the whole sex scandal issue. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  And as I said, I don't want to ask you to delve deeply or comment on it in detail because [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=319.2s)]
*  there's still a lot known. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  But is it your sense that had Matt Gaetz been different than what he is, had he been a swamp [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=325.92s)]
*  creature, had he been somebody who just sort of went along, that there would have been [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  a lot less interest in this sex scandal than there was when it was needed to prevent him [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=338.12s)]
*  from taking over the Justice Department? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=343.76s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=345.76s)]
*  And actually, speaking of Pete Hegstad, I mean, much more damaging, much more serious [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=347.76s)]
*  allegations against Pete Hegstad. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  But I would say, I don't know, I haven't run the numbers, but maybe 100 to 1 in terms of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  media coverage on Matt Gaetz. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=361.64s)]
*  And I think that I think part of that comes down to power and who Matt Gaetz has pissed [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=364.44s)]
*  off over the years, the established interest groups that he threatens with his kind of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=369.64s)]
*  policy platform. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that that kind of reflects that reality. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=375.68s)]
*  And I would go even further back than the list that you mentioned. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=377.64s)]
*  I mentioned Ralph Nader earlier, when he came out with his book, Too Safe, Unsafe at Any [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=381.16s)]
*  Speed, looking at kind of the known design problems in the automobile industry that were [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=386.28s)]
*  killing people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=391.16s)]
*  General Motors had kind of worked with trying to frame him with a sex worker or something [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=392.08s)]
*  of that nature. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=397.28s)]
*  So this is a tried and true playbook from the corporate and kind of political elite to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=398.6s)]
*  use this kind of sexual allegation, sexual innuendo to destroy their political enemies. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=405.48s)]
*  And you're right, we don't know all the facts here, but the facts that are available here [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=410.56s)]
*  in the Matt Gaetz issue do not justify the rhetoric that you see in the political and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=416.12s)]
*  media sphere. I mean, if you log in to Twitter or X or Blue Sky or any of these platforms [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=422.8s)]
*  and you see any mention of Matt Gaetz, people claim that he is a rapist, a pedophile, that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=428.76s)]
*  he paid for child sex, that he's a sex criminal. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=433.8s)]
*  None of, you know, from the facts we know, none of that is justified whatsoever. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  There's this kind of trial by media, you're guilty until proven innocent dynamic that I [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=443.76s)]
*  find very unbecoming and kind of disgusting, actually. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=448.72s)]
*  And you can't kind of engage in any policy oriented debate, political dynamic when this [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  is what's overshadowing the entire discourse. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  Any kind of article I post about Matt Gaetz, I wrote another piece about him last week just [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=462.88s)]
*  looking at some of his heterodox votes and his kind of more worker, small business aligned, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=467.68s)]
*  pro-consumer policy agenda, which is very unusual for a House Republican member. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=473.52s)]
*  And you look at thousands of responses to this article and it's this person is a child [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  rapist, he's a pedophile. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=484.04s)]
*  I mean, it's just incredibly toxic and dishonest. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=485.44s)]
*  And so many more examples, like obviously that was done with Brett Kavanaugh and out of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=488.08s)]
*  the blue appeared like decades old allegations. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=492.4s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this, but in Massachusetts... [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  The outstores and Richard Neal? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=499.48s)]
*  For people just to remind people that Richard Neal, even though most people don't know his [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  name, is an extremely powerful member of Congress. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  He was the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which controls essentially [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=506.04s)]
*  the budget. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=509.24s)]
*  And when this young gay mayor of a town in Massachusetts decided to run against him in [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=510.04s)]
*  the primary to primary Richard Neal, out of nowhere came this scandal that when he was [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=516.28s)]
*  28, 29, 30 years old, he was talking to 21, 22 year old gay men on Grindr that he actually [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=522.12s)]
*  had gone out with them. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  And the same rhetoric was deployed against him that he was a pedophile, that he was some [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=529.64s)]
*  sort of sex pest, even though all of them were above the age of consent. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=533.24s)]
*  And then it turned out that that scandal was... [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=538.04s)]
*  And all these left-wing groups ran away and canceled their endorsement of him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=539.9599999999999s)]
*  And it turned out that that scandal was manufactured by a bunch of slimy Democratic [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=544.28s)]
*  party operatives who wanted a job with Richard Neal and who went to Amherst College and who [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=550.28s)]
*  helped invent that, knowing that that's the way to destroy people's reputation. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=555.56s)]
*  And I have to say two things, which is... [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=558.36s)]
*  I just want to get your reaction. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  One is that in the Matt Gaetz case, it's actually even worse than a lot of the other cases, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=563.48s)]
*  because here the Justice Department aggressively and actively investigated Matt Gaetz to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=568.28s)]
*  determine whether or not there was any evidence that he committed crimes. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=573.9599999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't the Trump GOJ that did it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=577.16s)]
*  It was the Biden DOJ. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=578.92s)]
*  And obviously they were eager to get Matt Gaetz. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=580.76s)]
*  They leaked constantly to try and destroy his reputation. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=583.56s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they closed the case on the grounds that there was no evidence [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=586.76s)]
*  available to prove that he was guilty of any crime. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=590.92s)]
*  And yet this doesn't matter at all. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=593.0s)]
*  It's not even just that the government never proved his case. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  It's that the government actively investigated and themselves said [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=597.16s)]
*  there's no evidence that he committed a crime. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=599.9599999999999s)]
*  And then the other aspect that I think the reason why these weapons are so effective [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=601.4s)]
*  is because once somebody is accused of that, like Julian Assange gets accused of rape [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  or Alex Morris gets accused of, I don't know, somehow like pedophilia or being a sex pass [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  because he was like dating 22 year old gay men. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=616.68s)]
*  Obviously in the case of Matt Gaetz, and I've defended Matt Gaetz, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=620.76s)]
*  I've just done due process ground, I've defended Alex Morris based on the ground. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=623.88s)]
*  You know what happens to you when you stick your head up and defend any of these people, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=628.04s)]
*  which is you then get kind of smeared by the same tactic like, oh, he must be defending [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=632.28s)]
*  Matt Gaetz because he's a pedophile and Richie and Alex Morris or Julian Assange [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=637.64s)]
*  because he's a sex pass. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=642.04s)]
*  And it's a huge incentive for people to just kind of run away and not have anybody defending them [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=643.56s)]
*  so that just the accusations themselves are enough to destroy the person without any due [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=649.48s)]
*  process or evidence required. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=653.4s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=655.4s)]
*  You know, I haven't written anything publicly about the Matt Gaetz sexual allegations. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=656.1999999999999s)]
*  And yet when I post a tweet or my story about, you know, narrowly about Matt Gaetz's policy [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=662.52s)]
*  positions, his political positions, his beliefs around privacy or political power or business, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=670.52s)]
*  you know, I get swarmed with people claim that I'm in support of sex crimes or I support [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=676.1999999999999s)]
*  pedophilia. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=681.8s)]
*  You know, it's a chilling dynamic. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  I think, you know, I don't mind it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, I've gone through the wringer a few times, but I think for most reporters, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=687.16s)]
*  they see this dynamic. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  They don't think it's worth it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=692.2s)]
*  So they don't say anything, you know, they keep quiet and they or they actively engage [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=693.16s)]
*  in this smear campaign. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=697.32s)]
*  And, you know, for the Richard Neal case, you know, this, you know, just for your listeners, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  some one additional context, Democrats have talked for 30 years now about closing the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=704.0400000000001s)]
*  loopholes that hedge fund managers and private equity bosses exploit. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=709.88s)]
*  So they pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=714.6s)]
*  You know, it's something that Obama talked about a lot and many other Democratic politicians. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=717.48s)]
*  One of the big reasons that never actually changes, even under Democratic control, is [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=721.24s)]
*  that people like Richard Neal, who was the top Democrat on the tax writing committee, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=725.4s)]
*  is very cozy with big business and with those major donors. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=729.4s)]
*  So, you know, this effort to primary him from a more progressive candidate from Alex Morris, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=733.16s)]
*  completely concocted fake allegation of a sex crime, of, you know, grooming people or [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=738.76s)]
*  whatever. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=747.08s)]
*  I mean, it was it was a honeypot thing where operatives were lying to him and manipulating [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=747.5600000000001s)]
*  these kind of like attempts at dates. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=753.72s)]
*  And you just look at the reaction that so many left wing and Democratic groups after this, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=755.72s)]
*  I think very obviously fake allegation came out, you know, they ran for the hills. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=761.72s)]
*  They abandoned this effort to challenge Richard Neal. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=766.12s)]
*  So, you know, this is the part of the process of how the establishment stays in power. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=769.24s)]
*  You wonder why does the tax code never change or perhaps why the ingredients in cereal never [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=773.0799999999999s)]
*  change when it comes to RFK or something else. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=778.28s)]
*  It's the same kind of smear cycle. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=780.52s)]
*  And again, you know, not just the just to pick up one other thread that you mentioned, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=782.76s)]
*  it's not just that the DOJ aggressively investigated this and had many FBI agents, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=789.64s)]
*  had the FBI agents even paying for the therapy of some of the women who were involved. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=795.64s)]
*  You know, you see so much other evidence. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=801.32s)]
*  I encourage anyone who's curious about this Gates dynamic. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=803.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes, we don't know all the facts publicly yet. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  But Chris Dorworth, a Florida lobbyist, was allegedly shaken down by a criminal in Florida, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=810.9200000000001s)]
*  someone who introduced Gates allegedly to some of these women as this criminal, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=819.64s)]
*  Joel Greenberg, I believe is his name. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=828.68s)]
*  He was a local tax collector in Florida. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=830.68s)]
*  You know, he was using taxpayer money on crypto scams and pyramid schemes. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=832.84s)]
*  He was using taxpayer money to pay prostitutes. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=836.52s)]
*  You know, he was abusing his office. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=839.64s)]
*  He controlled the government office that created, that creates IDs and he was creating fake IDs [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=841.4s)]
*  for himself and for other people. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=845.56s)]
*  I mean, including ones to make underage girls like who were 17 look like they were [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=847.16s)]
*  above the age of consent. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=852.52s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=855.16s)]
*  And so this guy, Joel Greenberg, after he's caught for his criminal enterprise, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=856.04s)]
*  he attempts to basically shake down powerful Florida politicians and obtain a pardon from [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=861.64s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=868.12s)]
*  And part of that effort included Chris Dorworth and Matt Gates and others who he believed to be [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  close to Donald Trump. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=874.6s)]
*  And there's a lot of text messages and evidence that there was a very elaborate scheme from [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=875.96s)]
*  Greenberg's family, which was very wealthy and from Greenberg himself, to basically coerce [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=883.08s)]
*  and smear folks who would not join the scheme. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=889.08s)]
*  You know, he created fake social media profiles to claim that people, other people were pedophiles. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=891.96s)]
*  He attempted to honeypot folks to essentially extort people to obtain this pardon from Donald [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=897.9599999999999s)]
*  Trump and he didn't get it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=905.4799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, read the lawsuit from Chris Dorworth, look at all the evidence. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=907.3199999999999s)]
*  Again, not all the facts are known yet, but from the few facts that we do know, nothing [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=911.64s)]
*  has really justified the smear campaign that we've seen in the last two weeks. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiIFiBwJRo&t=916.12s)]
