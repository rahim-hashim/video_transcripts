# "DISASTER!" Columbia Prof. Jeffrey Sachs Condemns Israel's War in Gaza | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A)
*  Obviously the last time we had you on there was not this new war, this war in the Middle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=0.0s)]
*  East between Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=10.0s)]
*  The major parts of the world have obviously transformed and changed as a result of this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=12.52s)]
*  brand new war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  We were talking a lot about the last war when you were on the last few times, which is the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  war in Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=22.92s)]
*  I think people have forgotten that that's kind of still plodding along. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=23.92s)]
*  As far as this new war is concerned in Israel-Gaza, obviously this latest outbreak began with [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=27.38s)]
*  this horrific attack on Israeli civilians by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=32.06s)]
*  It's now been about five weeks of relentless Israeli bombing and now a ground invasion [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=36.14s)]
*  that many, many sources say, including U.S. intelligence, have killed in excess of 10,000 [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=40.98s)]
*  Palestinians, 4,500, almost 5,000 children devastated the infrastructure of Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=46.46s)]
*  What do you make of this war in general before we get to some specific questions? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  Well, it's a disaster, of course. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=56.78s)]
*  What Israel is doing is a danger to Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=59.7s)]
*  It is absolutely one war crime after another in Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=64.78s)]
*  It is not going to lead to any kind of safety for Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=71.8s)]
*  So we have yet another absolute disaster on our hands, which is worsening American [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=77.66s)]
*  security, world security, pushing the chances of more global war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=85.86s)]
*  So I can't say I'm, well, no one can be happy about this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=92.86s)]
*  The Hamas attack was horrific. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=99.94s)]
*  The response has been absolutely mind-boggling in its inappropriateness and the damage that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=102.5s)]
*  it's creating. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=110.54s)]
*  Today, as I'm sure you know, a lawsuit was filed in the federal court of district court [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=111.54s)]
*  for Northern District of California by the, what is the name of the group? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=121.74s)]
*  The Center for Constitutional Rights, saying that America is complicit in genocide. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=133.18s)]
*  So with a brief that is horrifying, actually, because it's dozens of pages of all of the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=141.26s)]
*  horrific things that are being committed by Israel right now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=152.22s)]
*  So this has to stop. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=155.94s)]
*  This is extraordinarily destructive and dangerous. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=158.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's no question this has become an American war, as almost every Israeli war [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=163.5s)]
*  and the Biden administration made clear, we're going to give Israel everything it needs. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=169.02s)]
*  Everybody knows in that region and around the world that when they see a bomb dropping [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=174.18s)]
*  on a hospital or an ambulance or a church or a school or a mosque, even with the Israeli [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=177.9s)]
*  claim that Hamas is there, everybody knows those are actually American bombs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  America feeds Israel the bombs and pays for the bombs and any reverberations on Israel [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=185.74s)]
*  always spill over to the United States as well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=190.66000000000003s)]
*  We have a sizable part of our audience, not a majority I don't think, but certainly a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  non-trivial portion of our audience that definitely supports Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=198.1s)]
*  Maybe not everything they're doing, but certainly their response and their argument is the following [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=203.82s)]
*  and I want to get your response to it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=207.7s)]
*  Look, Israel was attacked in this, as you said, horrific way. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=209.66s)]
*  We don't know exactly how many civilians died. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=214.22s)]
*  Israel readjusted the number from 1,400 to 1,200 without a lot of explanation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=216.18s)]
*  Hundreds of those people were on military bases, were soldiers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=221.1s)]
*  Other civilians were killed from the Israeli response, but obviously Hamas deliberately [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=225.18s)]
*  killed a lot of civilians. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=228.9s)]
*  Their argument is no country could tolerate security breaches of that kind. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=231.02s)]
*  You keep criticizing what Israel is doing, but what should Israel do in order to prevent [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=235.38s)]
*  an attack like this from happening again? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=240.54s)]
*  The first thing is Israel let its guard down, which it should not have done. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=244.3s)]
*  This was a major security and intelligence failure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=248.18s)]
*  Israel had been warned in the days leading up to October 7 that the Hamas militants were [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=252.94s)]
*  going to undertake some kind of operation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=261.26s)]
*  The Egyptian government gave the warnings, but Israel has the worst government in its [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=264.58s)]
*  history. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=270.98s)]
*  The government failed completely. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  In fact, it is reported widely that soldiers that were guarding the border of Gaza and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=275.26000000000005s)]
*  Israel were on holiday or had been shifted to the West Bank. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=287.54s)]
*  And therefore, Israel let its guard down. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=294.18s)]
*  And the first thing it should do is keep its guard up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  So this is very basic. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=301.70000000000005s)]
*  The second thing that should have happened is that Netanyahu should have stepped down [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=304.54s)]
*  and taken responsibility for this massive failure. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=308.3s)]
*  The third is to think what is going to deliver Israeli security. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=312.82s)]
*  Now launching a massive war in Gaza, leveling a large part of northern Gaza, displacing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=319.62s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people, killing more than 11,000 people and more than 4,500 [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=331.82s)]
*  children. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=340.9s)]
*  And those are just the identified deaths because it is widely presumed that there are thousands [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=341.9s)]
*  of children and others under the rubble still whose deaths have not been accounted. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  The idea that this is going to lead to security is mind boggling. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=357.26000000000005s)]
*  What it has done is to isolate Israel almost entirely in the world. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=363.62s)]
*  Israel has one backer left. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=370.58000000000004s)]
*  That's the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=373.74s)]
*  I would say within the United Nations of the 193 countries, you can't count. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  You don't need two hands to count the number of countries that support what Israel is doing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=385.9s)]
*  Probably it's on one hand maximum. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=393.34s)]
*  Israel has isolated itself. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=397.7s)]
*  It's committing war crimes. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  Today, it was said that more than 100 UN workers have been killed in this attack. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=402.41999999999996s)]
*  The brazenness of it is also matched by the rhetoric, the intentionality of this extreme [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=412.46s)]
*  right-wing cabinet to level Gaza, to treat the residents of Gaza as animals. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=424.17999999999995s)]
*  That's their line. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  To say that Gaza will never recover from this, in other words, this brief that was filed [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=436.65999999999997s)]
*  about genocide documents the shocking statements because one of the conditions for a claim [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=445.74s)]
*  of genocide under the Genocide Treaty is intent. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=455.26s)]
*  And there is such vulgarity in the language of this extremist right-wing government that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=458.9s)]
*  it's there for all to see the ugliness of it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=465.66s)]
*  Now, Israel needs security, but it is never going to achieve security unless there is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=469.22s)]
*  a political settlement of a conflict that has been going on at least, one could say, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=476.5s)]
*  for 57 years, 56 years since the Six-Day War in 1967. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=484.82000000000005s)]
*  That political settlement requires the political rights of the Palestinian people. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=494.94s)]
*  This government not only has launched a war that it cannot win that could spread to regional [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=503.78000000000003s)]
*  war, but it absolutely opposes vehemently, vulgarly any kind of two-state solution which [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=512.42s)]
*  almost all, in fact, I would say the rest of the world, because even on that score, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=526.14s)]
*  the United States has reiterated almost every day in recent days that that's the only way [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=532.02s)]
*  forward, but this is a government which utterly rejects this. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  So they're launching a war that they cannot win that will kill tens of thousands of innocents [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=541.9s)]
*  and without any political vision at all other than continued domination by Israel of the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=551.1s)]
*  Palestinian people, which means no peace at all. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=559.38s)]
*  So nobody, no friend of Israel should be satisfied for one moment that what's happening is in [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=564.02s)]
*  Israel's interest. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=574.34s)]
*  There isn't anything that's happening that isn't self-destructive of Israel, or maybe [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=576.26s)]
*  that's not the right way to say it, that Netanyahu is creating destruction of Israel. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=581.5s)]
*  He's the worst prime minister Israel has ever had. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=587.6999999999999s)]
*  This cabinet is the most extremist that Israel has ever had, and this cabinet is doing grave [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=591.3s)]
*  damage to Israel, starting with letting Israel's basic guard down and then responding in a [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=597.02s)]
*  way which is absolutely destructive of Israel's security and its interests. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=604.18s)]
*  One of the, I think the event that comes to mind almost immediately, and this is something [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=611.4599999999999s)]
*  we've been emphasizing since the very first days after the October 7th attack, when I think the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=617.46s)]
*  space to kind of criticize Israel was very limited. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=623.46s)]
*  People were very traumatized by watching those images coming out of Israel. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=626.58s)]
*  No one wanted to hear any criticism of Israel. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=631.86s)]
*  So the thing we tried to say early on was, look, we have a historical lesson, a recent [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=633.78s)]
*  historical lesson that's highly comparable, which is we also suffered a terrible terrorist [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=639.34s)]
*  attack on 9-11 22 years ago, and 3,000 civilians were killed on that day. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=644.74s)]
*  Two gigantic skyscrapers in New York City came crashing down on top of our fellow citizens. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=651.3s)]
*  A plane was flown into the Pentagon. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=658.66s)]
*  It was very traumatic. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=660.9s)]
*  It was very outrageous. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=661.9s)]
*  And a lot of people have spent the last 20 years talking about the lessons of 9-11, the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=664.42s)]
*  idea that we overreacted, we fell into Bin Laden's hands by doing exactly what he hoped [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=669.06s)]
*  he would do, which was turn the world against us by going around the world madly bombing [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=675.46s)]
*  and a quest for vengeance, but no real geostrategic plan. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=679.94s)]
*  We said we were going to go to Afghanistan to destroy the Taliban, and 20 years later, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=683.46s)]
*  we left Afghanistan. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=688.34s)]
*  The Taliban walked right back into power as though nothing had happened because 20 years [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=689.3s)]
*  of occupation and war radicalized the population even further against the West and in favor [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=694.66s)]
*  of the Taliban. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=698.9s)]
*  But one of the things that has happened, and what happened back then after 9-11 was anybody [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=700.8199999999999s)]
*  who stood up and questioned these wars and what Bush and Cheney were doing with torture [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=705.14s)]
*  and Guantanamo and rendition and that whole panoply of things they wanted to do, everybody [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=709.3s)]
*  got accused who objected to being pro-terrorist or unpatriotic or on the side of Al-Qaeda, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=714.42s)]
*  and it was very effective. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=719.54s)]
*  It really repressed dissent for a long time in the United States. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=720.5799999999999s)]
*  The tactic that's being used now, not just in Israel but also in the United States, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  is to say that anyone who isn't fully supportive of the Israeli war is obviously guilty of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=727.9399999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitism, must hate Jews. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=733.38s)]
*  As a Jew myself, I've heard that, I don't know how many times every day for the last [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=736.8199999999999s)]
*  five weeks as I've expressed these criticisms of the Israeli response. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=741.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm wondering what you make of that as a tactic and how do you react to that when you hear that? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=745.6199999999999s)]
*  Well, let me say the analogy with 9-11 is even more direct. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=750.66s)]
*  It's said that the United States acted with rage and therefore made a lot of grave errors, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=757.38s)]
*  but I think it's actually deeper than that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=767.4599999999999s)]
*  The United States government at the time, I would not say the nation, but I would say [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=770.5799999999999s)]
*  the government under George W. Bush Jr. and Cheney didn't react with rage so much [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=776.18s)]
*  as react with a planned neocon agenda, which was actually already in place in the late 1990s, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=785.06s)]
*  the project for a new American century. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=797.9399999999999s)]
*  The idea of the PNAC, the project for a new American century was in a unipolar world, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=801.46s)]
*  so they thought in their delusions that the US stands alone in its power and can do whatever [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=809.78s)]
*  it wants and define reality the way that it wants was literally described by one of the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=816.9s)]
*  neocon protagonists was that 9-11 would be used to take out every American foe. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=823.54s)]
*  So we know that the first reaction to 9-11 wasn't even Al-Qaeda or Afghanistan. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=835.6999999999999s)]
*  The first reaction was Iraq. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=842.42s)]
*  Now we can go after Iraq. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=844.66s)]
*  Now we can go after Saddam Hussein. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=846.74s)]
*  It was questioned, what do you mean Iraq? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=849.86s)]
*  Don't you mean Afghanistan? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=851.9399999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, we mean Iraq. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=853.06s)]
*  Now we can do what we have wanted to do. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=854.66s)]
*  And so this was an agenda of the United States. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=858.5799999999999s)]
*  It was absolutely mind-boggling in its craziness, in its ineptitude, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=862.9s)]
*  in the trillions of dollars that it cost in the destruction of America's reputation around the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=872.9799999999999s)]
*  world, in the freefall of American prestige, which believe me happened and continues to happen, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=879.06s)]
*  and has changed the world and diminished America's safety from not just Afghanistan and Iraq, but [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=887.6199999999999s)]
*  the not-so-covert covert operations to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, the mobilization of NATO to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=898.5s)]
*  overthrow Qaddafi. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=906.1s)]
*  This was all a sequence of operations that was anticipated already in the late 1990s. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=907.3000000000001s)]
*  Now the reason I make all of this analogy is this government of Netanyahu is not just acting with [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=915.14s)]
*  rage, it's acting with an agenda. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=925.3000000000001s)]
*  And you look across the cabinet and listen to the words of Smoltrich, the finance minister, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=929.14s)]
*  of course to Netanyahu himself, who's just the most awful prime minister in Israel's history, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=937.86s)]
*  to the interior minister, to across the board, they have an agenda. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=946.98s)]
*  The agenda has been what is called the greater Israel or greater land of Israel, which is that [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=953.22s)]
*  Israel really should control in any way not only Israel, but the Palestinian territories, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=965.06s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=974.42s)]
*  And for some it goes even beyond that because they look to the book of Joshua in the Bible [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=977.14s)]
*  and say, oh, the promised land is even beyond that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=983.22s)]
*  What they're doing is curing out an agenda. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=987.22s)]
*  It includes like Jordan, in multiple Middle Eastern countries, all part of greater Israel. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=987.94s)]
*  It actually goes to Mesopotamia. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=994.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=996.34s)]
*  It goes to the Euphrates, no less. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=997.7s)]
*  It's a kind of mind boggling book, by the way, to read because it's a book of serial [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1000.8199999999999s)]
*  genocides, as a matter of fact. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1008.34s)]
*  But the point is that this cabinet wants to clear out Gaza. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1010.66s)]
*  That was the first impulse. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1018.42s)]
*  Actually, the United States was almost pulled along. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1020.1s)]
*  They tried to talk El Sisi in Egypt into this. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1022.98s)]
*  He said, no way I'm going to be a party to the next Nakba, the next disaster of the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1027.38s)]
*  Palestinian people by opening Rafa, the border with Gaza and Egypt, to take in hundreds of [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1035.6200000000001s)]
*  thousands of Gazans fleeing after Israel told them, you must flee for your life, giving [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1045.3000000000002s)]
*  them a few hours to flee for their life. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1053.8600000000001s)]
*  So this is an agenda. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1058.0200000000002s)]
*  And in that sense, the analogy to 9-11 is even more precise. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1059.38s)]
*  It's not just blind rage. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1066.0200000000002s)]
*  It's a political agenda. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1068.0200000000002s)]
*  And we should understand, I think it's the smartest words about war that have been uttered [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1070.5800000000002s)]
*  since Sun Tzu, since the strategy of war in ancient China by von Clausewitz, the war theorist [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1081.22s)]
*  in Germany in the period just after the Napoleonic Wars. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1091.6200000000001s)]
*  And in von Clausewitz's famous book on war, he says very famously that war is the continuation [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1096.5800000000002s)]
*  of politics with other means. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1105.38s)]
*  And so when you see conflict, think politics. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1108.66s)]
*  Don't just think rage or attack and counterattack. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1113.62s)]
*  But what's the underlying politics? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1118.66s)]
*  In Ukraine, the underlying politics is NATO enlargement. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1121.86s)]
*  This is a war over NATO enlargement, which I think was a reckless thing for the United States to do. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1126.58s)]
*  And it put Ukraine into the battleground of a proxy war between the US and Russia, which [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1135.46s)]
*  is destroying Ukraine. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1143.3s)]
*  Now, what is the politics here? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1145.54s)]
*  The politics here is that the people of Palestine do not have political rights. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1148.1000000000001s)]
*  They live in a condition dominated by Israel, effectively as countless organizations have [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1156.42s)]
*  rightly pointed out, an apartheid system imposed by Israel. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1164.82s)]
*  And the whole world, including the United States, has said this has to be remedied by [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1169.86s)]
*  a Palestinian state. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1177.3799999999999s)]
*  And even President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken have repeated this several times [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1179.06s)]
*  in the last days. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1188.34s)]
*  But this is precisely what Netanyahu and his government oppose. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1190.42s)]
*  So this is not a war to end the Hamas threat in order to move to a state of Palestine. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1196.9s)]
*  Completely the opposite. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1207.22s)]
*  This is a war being waged by Israel ostensibly to crush Hamas, but to dominate [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1209.14s)]
*  the Palestinian lands. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6mi_sGao4A&t=1218.58s)]
