# Pro-Censorship Governments FUMING Over Zuckerberg Announcement
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8)
*  One of the amazing parts has been watching quote-unquote disinformation experts and fact-checkers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=0.0s)]
*  basically react to what Mark Zuckerberg said by saying, we fact-check him and we're here [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=13.0s)]
*  to say, we're not bad for democracy, we don't censor, this is, we rate this false. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  These arbiters of truth that have been self-anointed to justify censorship, here from The Guardian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=24.86s)]
*  in January 8th, which is yesterday, quote, Brazil says Metta getting rid of fact-checkers [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=28.6s)]
*  is quote, bad for democracy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=33.88s)]
*  The decision by the social media giant Metta to end fact-checking in the United States [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=36.88s)]
*  is quote, bad for democracy, Brazil's newly appointed communication minister, Sidonia [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=40.32s)]
*  Palmeiras said on Wednesday. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Metta's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, stunned many with his announcement on Tuesday [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=46.84s)]
*  that he was pulling the plug on fact-checking at Facebook and Instagram in the US, citing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=50.42s)]
*  concerns about political bias. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Palmeiras had met his decision was quote, bad for democracy because without fact-checking, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=57.28s)]
*  you don't control the spread of hate, misinformation and fake news. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Quote, that's the problem, we need to have control. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=64.92s)]
*  Exactly, listen to that, that quote. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=67.68s)]
*  We need to have control, we need to regulate social media. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  That's what's happening in Europe, he said. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=74.56s)]
*  On Wednesday, the Brazilian president, Luiz Anassio Lula da Silva, raised a scourge of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=76.0s)]
*  disinformation during a ceremony marking two years since supporters of his predecessor, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=79.68s)]
*  Jair Bolsonaro, stormed the seats of power in Brasilia. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=84.2s)]
*  Quote, we defend and will always defend freedom of expression but, you always know that a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=87.48s)]
*  tyrannical sentiment is coming when someone starts off by saying, yeah, of course, I believe [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  in free speech, free expression, but what comes after the but is the only part that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=97.76s)]
*  matters, the first part is just throat clearing and it's always to negate that cursory affirmation [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=102.28s)]
*  of a belief in free speech and that's exactly what he says here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=107.88s)]
*  Quote, we defend and will always defend freedom of expression, said Lula, but we will not [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=110.16s)]
*  tolerate hate speech and disinformation which endanger people's lives and incite violence [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  against the rule of law. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  As always, it's a nice idea and concept. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=121.8s)]
*  Who would ever say, yeah, I want false ideas to circulate, I want hate speech to circulate, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=124.44s)]
*  the problem is these are very malleable terms, they're very subjective. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=129.6s)]
*  What your political inclination is will absolutely determine what you interpret. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=134.78s)]
*  These terms can be or not to be and we've seen that over and over and that is what Mark [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=141.26s)]
*  Zuckerberg said that has really upset them the most as he pointed out that this is a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=146.94s)]
*  fraudulent industry, they are completely politicized, they're not engaged in fact checking or in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=150.32s)]
*  disinformation, anti-disinformation activism, they're engaged in pure political activism [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=155.66s)]
*  and political censorship masquerading as something more noble. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=162.02s)]
*  Here is another article by Globo that tries to highlight a very particular aspect of the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=166.58s)]
*  meta-policy that they regard as particularly pernicious and this has been emphasized in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=173.26s)]
*  the United States as well and I think it's so important to underscore the falsehood and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=177.66s)]
*  the deceit that's at stake here and people are claiming our society will be endangered, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  democracy will be endangered somehow if we don't permit free speech. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=189.7s)]
*  This is the English translation of the headline, quote, meta-publishes a Portuguese language [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=192.66s)]
*  version of hate speech rules that allow for the linking between mental illness and sexual [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=197.38s)]
*  orientation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=203.06s)]
*  The new community standard rules are global and already in effect so they're extremely [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=205.14s)]
*  angry in Brazil that you're now allowed to express the view that you think homosexuality [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  or bisexuality or transgenderism are byproducts of mental illness. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=216.2s)]
*  This to them is proof that no society can allow free speech because that's the sort [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=222.0s)]
*  of thing that will be permitted to say and it's not just in Brazil, it's also here in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  the United States, American media outlets are also pointing to all the parade of terribles [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=230.92s)]
*  that are going to happen now that on Facebook or on Meta's platforms you're not going to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  be censored anymore. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=239.12s)]
*  Here from Axios, echoing the Brazilian sentiment which has no, Brazilian culture has very little [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=240.04s)]
*  tradition of protecting robust free speech, here in Axios, January 9th, 2025, that's today, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  Meta's new policies open the gate to hate. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  And then it says, text, why it matters. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=257.72s)]
*  Meta's move to do away with third party fact checkers made headlines but some experts are [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  even more troubled by policy shifts. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=263.94s)]
*  They say could chill online speech and lead to more real world violence. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=266.3s)]
*  Zoom in. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=270.88s)]
*  These are the little Axios headers that they think allow people with short attention spans [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=272.08s)]
*  to ingest the news in three minutes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=277.48s)]
*  They say, Meta's revised policy around hateful conduct, previously referred to as hate speech, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=280.12s)]
*  removes some prohibitions entirely while also making new exceptions that allow people who [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=285.8s)]
*  are women, transgender, gay, or immigrant to be targeted in ways prohibited for other [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=290.04s)]
*  groups. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=294.4s)]
*  We do allow content arguing for gender-based limitations of military law enforcement and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=295.4s)]
*  training jobs, Meta says when it revised policy quote. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=299.88s)]
*  We also allow the same content based on sexual orientation when the content is based on religious [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=302.68s)]
*  beliefs. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=307.08s)]
*  Elsewhere, Meta says, we do not allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=308.08s)]
*  on gender or sexual orientation given political and, actually go back, I think I read that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  wrong. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=317.68s)]
*  So yeah, Elsewhere, Meta says, we do now allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=318.68s)]
*  when based on gender or sexual orientation given political and religious discourse about [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=324.64s)]
*  transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like quote, weird. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=328.96s)]
*  The new policy also makes room for people to call for gay and trans people to be excluded [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=334.52s)]
*  from specific places. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=339.32s)]
*  While the company kept language that says quote, we believe that people use their voice [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=341.0s)]
*  and connect more freely when they don't feel attacked on the basis of who they are, the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=344.0s)]
*  company removed a line that said hate speech quote creates an environment of intimidation [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=348.52s)]
*  and exclusion and in some cases may promote offline violence. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=352.2s)]
*  The expert said that the changes taken as a whole amount to quote, given a free pass [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=357.84s)]
*  for cherry pick issues that align perfectly with culture war hot topics for the right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  Now I wonder whether these people have ever heard of the First Amendment because under [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=367.76s)]
*  the First Amendment, which journalists, people who call themselves journalists, are supposed [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=375.23999999999995s)]
*  to be duty bound to defend. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=379.55999999999995s)]
*  This is, we're not, journalists are not supposed to have political opinions, at least ones [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=382.32s)]
*  that they purposely integrate into their work, but there are values journalists are expected [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=386.56s)]
*  to defend. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  One of them is free speech, one of them is a free press. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=392.0s)]
*  Obviously under the First Amendment in the United States, under free speech ethos in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=396.56s)]
*  the United States, you're allowed to express any of those views, it's not even a question. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=399.48s)]
*  Of course you're allowed to say that you think homosexuality and transgenderism is the byproduct [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=403.72s)]
*  of mental illness. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=407.92s)]
*  You couldn't be prosecuted for that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  Of course you're allowed to misgender people, of course you're allowed to say that women [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=411.16s)]
*  shouldn't be in combat or homosexuality should be a basis for excluding people from the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=415.84s)]
*  military or transgenderism should. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=420.35999999999996s)]
*  These are all unquestionably permissible ideas. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=423.11999999999995s)]
*  And the thing that I think aside from the evils of censorship on principle and the dangers [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  they create when put in the hands of government that will always abuse them and expand radically [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  what they mean by hate speech and disinformation to prevent and even criminalize criticism [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  of what they do, which is exactly what's happening in Brazil and in some parts of the EU, aside [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=441.4s)]
*  from all of that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=445.8s)]
*  Let me just say that when gay rights in the United States first started really being debated [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  in a serious way, which happened in the late 80s and into the 90s, throughout the 90s, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=454.0s)]
*  into the 2000s, it was extremely common for people to believe and to say that they thought [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=458.8s)]
*  homosexuality was a mental disorder that had been in medical, official medical definitions [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=465.8s)]
*  of diseases for many, many years in the United States, for decades in the United States, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=474.4s)]
*  homosexuality was considered a mental disorder. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=479.8s)]
*  And the reason so many people ended up changing their minds about that, the reason why the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=483.12s)]
*  gay and lesbian movement ultimately won not just acceptance socially but full legal equality [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=487.44s)]
*  is not because they convinced people to make it illegal to express those views. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=492.8s)]
*  It's not because they engendered a prohibition on people saying those things, it's precisely [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=499.12s)]
*  because those things could be said and as a result of that freedom to say them, other [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=505.52s)]
*  people who disagreed could engage those arguments and convince people that it wasn't true. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=511.24s)]
*  And over time people got convinced. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=515.96s)]
*  The reason why the gay and lesbian movement won in the United States, the reason why legal [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=517.78s)]
*  equality was obtained is not because people were forced to accept it, it's because people [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=521.48s)]
*  got persuaded through free debate and free discourse and free association, either that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=526.56s)]
*  they were wrong in their views of homosexuality or that they shouldn't try and get the state [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=533.3599999999999s)]
*  to regulate it because adults could do what they wanted in their private lives and it [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=537.04s)]
*  wasn't a harm to them, which was a huge change. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=539.8s)]
*  That happened not because of censorship but because of the ability to engage that debate. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=543.16s)]
*  I can't tell you how many debates I had with people, civil constructed debates I had with [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=547.4799999999999s)]
*  people in the late 80s and throughout the 90s who believed because of religious views, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=550.9599999999999s)]
*  because of cultural views, because of what they were taught since childhood, because [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=555.56s)]
*  of what they just believed as adults that homosexuality was some sort of moral evil, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=558.8399999999999s)]
*  that it was a byproduct of mental illness. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  And all you have to do is look at polling and the changes in mores and the changes in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=565.0s)]
*  law and see how many people, most people change their views on that because of the ability [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=569.56s)]
*  to freely debate it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  The idea that somehow people are protected when you prohibit others from expressing the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=577.76s)]
*  views that whether you let them say it on Facebook or not they're still holding is [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=585.36s)]
*  preposterous. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=590.26s)]
*  And I should also point out that censorship is never ever an instrument of the marginalized. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=593.76s)]
*  It's always an instrument of the powerful by definition. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=599.6s)]
*  It's always the powerful who ends up wielding it and they wield it for their own interests, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=601.92s)]
*  not for people who are quote unquote marginalized. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=604.96s)]
*  So even that example that oh my god this is so civilization ending that meta is now going [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=609.66s)]
*  to be more permissive because you can't argue that transgenderism is a mental illness, whether [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=616.78s)]
*  you allow people to say that or not they believe it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=622.5s)]
*  A lot of people do. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=625.78s)]
*  And of course it's better to have that freely discussed and debated. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=628.26s)]
*  That changes minds. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=632.06s)]
*  History proves that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=633.06s)]
*  All of the whatever you want to consider social progress in the United States and elsewhere [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=634.98s)]
*  in free countries has been the byproduct of free debate and persuasion and engagement, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=638.34s)]
*  not prohibition and censorship and repression. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=642.82s)]
*  That doesn't change minds of anything. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=646.0600000000001s)]
*  It solidifies those views because people just keep them in inside and resentment grows over [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=648.1800000000001s)]
*  them as well. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njTtSWSMF8&t=654.5400000000001s)]
