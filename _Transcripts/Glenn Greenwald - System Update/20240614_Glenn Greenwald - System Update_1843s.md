# Right-Wing TikTok Star John McEntee on TikTok Ban, the Trump Administration, and More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k)
*  John McEntee works as a production assistant, worked as a production assistant at Fox News and other jobs there as well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=0.0s)]
*  And then he parlayed that into various roles in the Trump White House and has often proclaimed his support for President Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=14.4s)]
*  Upon leaving the White House, he sought to create a dating app for conservatives, largely on TikTok. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=23.36s)]
*  And it became a massive success with an account that grew to millions of followers, which he now regularly uses to express all kinds of conservative and right wing views to millions of people who use that app. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  He also has a lot of heterodox views that you don't traditionally hear from people with large platforms and conservative audiences, including raging against the TikTok bill that passed the ban on TikTok or the for sale that was supported by both parties. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=40.199999999999996s)]
*  He's often a harsh critic of the GOP establishment, and we thought it was important to bring him on to hear those views that millions of people are hearing in a different media ecosystem than many of you are a part of or listen to or understand. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=53.96s)]
*  And we are delighted to welcome him to our program. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=69.72s)]
*  John, thanks so much for coming on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=72.12s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=73.36s)]
*  I'm excited to talk to you about this kind of world that a lot of people don't know. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=74.04s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much for having me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=80.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  So let me just begin by asking you, the platforms on which you've developed this very large audience are places like TikTok and Instagram. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=83.16s)]
*  And I think even for people who use more mainstream online platforms, say like YouTube or Twitter to talk about politics, it's kind of like a different foreign world. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=92.24s)]
*  It's really amazing how there are a lot of people with many millions of followers there who are unrecognizable and unknown to people who work within corporate media, even though a lot of those people have much bigger audiences than they do. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  So you've obviously been around you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=115.8s)]
*  You worked in the Trump White House. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  You worked for Fox News before that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  Can you describe what you think the differences are in terms of how politics is discussed, how messaging is conveyed and how it's heard on places like TikTok and Instagram as opposed to the other platforms? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=135.32s)]
*  So I think something like Twitter is really made for politics. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  And when you bring that kind of humor or takes to something like TikTok that is very mainstream and normie and young, they think it's really fresh and exciting, especially in the culture we're living in right now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  All of these takes, a lot of these young people haven't heard. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  Whereas if I posted it on Twitter, everyone would laugh, but they've already heard that take. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's reaching a different audience and it's actually where all of the eyes are. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=163.0s)]
*  You know, when we were thinking about how to best promote our app, we're thinking, well, where is everyone? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Everyone is on TikTok, you know, 170 million Americans and also the demographic that we're going after promoting a dating app. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, like, where's the 25 year old girl that we want on our app? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=182.12s)]
*  She's not really on Twitter or Telegram or Rumble, but she's on TikTok. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  So that's what we focused on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  And then obviously went to Instagram as well. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  And yeah, it's been going pretty well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  So I think one of the interesting parts about your success there is that when people talk about, especially TikTok in kind of more mainstream or establishment type venues, it's usually thought of as a very left wing site. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=195.84s)]
*  It's a reason, I think, why a lot of conservatives supporting banning it or forcing it sell to a company who the U.S. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=209.12s)]
*  government could control more. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=215.56s)]
*  You saw a platform like Libs of TikTok become a major force. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=217.24s)]
*  And her name was Libs of TikTok, and she specialized in showing how these kind of deranged left liberals were dominating on TikTok. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=222.76s)]
*  That was what she began by doing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=230.04s)]
*  How were you able to find success as somebody who is very openly advocating for right wing and conservative, even right wing populist views? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=232.04s)]
*  Is it that that perception of TikTok as a largely overwhelmingly left wing site is inaccurate or were you able to do something to make you find an audience? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=242.16s)]
*  I actually do think it's inaccurate. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=252.84s)]
*  I think the country has become more conservative culturally under Biden. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=255.0s)]
*  And just those kind of speaking to them and like, you know, giving them something they haven't heard before. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=260.16s)]
*  Also, so few conservatives were on TikTok. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=266.04s)]
*  So it was easy to take off because everyone's competing in the same spaces. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=269.4s)]
*  And for whatever reason, because of some national security hoax, people weren't comfortable going on TikTok. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=273.76s)]
*  And we're like, we'll go on it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=280.24s)]
*  We'll use it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=281.88s)]
*  And we were able to thrive that way. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=283.12s)]
*  So one of the things I think, you know, I'm a big defender of independent media, the idea that you can reach millions of people now through the Internet without having to own a printing press or a big satellite and network system that enables you to transmit. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=285.48s)]
*  I think that's one of the big innovations of the Internet that has then given rise to independent media. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=300.72s)]
*  You don't have to be part of a big corporation to communicate with millions of people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=305.88s)]
*  One of the dangers of it, and of course, everything has its imperfections, is that oftentimes the way people succeed is by just kind of planting their flag in a certain ideological or partisan camp, attracting only like minded people who already are kind of converted. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's just kind of preaching to the choir. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=325.4s)]
*  It can be lucrative, but you're not actually reaching people whose minds need changing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=327.0s)]
*  Do you feel like your content is actually reaching people who don't necessarily identify as conservatives or right wing, but who are nonetheless open to the kinds of things you're saying? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=331.88s)]
*  Of course. And I think this is actually pretty unique to TikTok and their algorithm. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=342.2s)]
*  Our content gets to a wide variety of people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=346.64s)]
*  And you can see it in our comments section. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=349.96s)]
*  You can see it on our app. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, I've talked to people that have discovered our app and they don't go on Twitter. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=353.4s)]
*  They don't watch Fox News. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  They might not even know who Tucker Carlson is, yet they were willing to download a Republican dating app just because they kind of agreed with our content. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=358.92s)]
*  They thought it was funny. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  They thought the world is all upside down. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=368.88s)]
*  I actually agree with this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=370.6s)]
*  And they might not be a registered Republican, but they're culturally conservative and they're buying into what we're selling. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  So I think we're reaching a lot of different people, a lot of normies that haven't been engaged in the political process at all. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=377.76s)]
*  And we'll see what's Trump coming on the platform if that helps his election as well. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it can hurt it in any way, but just talking to people that aren't usually reached is just so valuable. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  And yeah, I see us reaching a lot of different people. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=397.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's something I'm so fascinated with. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  I've been at Rumble now for about a year and a half. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=404.56s)]
*  I came to Rumble principally because I wanted to help support its cause of preserving free speech online. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  But as part of that, I talked to them a lot. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=412.44s)]
*  I kind of consult with them and I discovered there's this kind of a whole new world of major, major influencers who are extremely well known, even famous among, you know, a huge chunk of the country, primarily young people, but not only. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=415.96s)]
*  And yet these people who are extremely famous on the one hand among this kind of fragmented, isolated part of the Internet are completely unknown to people who are just always thinking about politics by reading the New York Times or watching cable news. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=430.2s)]
*  And in turn, those people are completely unknown to the people in TikTok. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=445.52s)]
*  How did you bridge that? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=450.52s)]
*  Because you actually came from Fox. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=451.96s)]
*  You came from the Trump White House. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=453.44s)]
*  What made you decide to go that route? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=455.48s)]
*  Well, I actually just bought into doing it the TikTok way. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=458.84s)]
*  You know, their trends, a kind of TikTok style version with like a short video. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=462.32s)]
*  And I've never actually really brought up the fact that I worked in the administration or in politics or for Trump. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  And like 99 percent of the people that follow us don't even know that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=473.88s)]
*  I mean, they're kind of discovering it as more things come out and articles are written about it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=478.32s)]
*  But our initial audience is just they just think I'm a funny TikToker that, you know, likes to make fun of different situations or different cultural issues. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=482.88s)]
*  They don't really know the tie into politics. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=492.6s)]
*  And I think that's why it was successful. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=494.48s)]
*  You know, a lot of political content on the right gets stale and gets very boomer, you know, and people kind of just reject it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=496.24s)]
*  They see it and they swipe by it or they X out or they don't tune in. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=503.72s)]
*  And I think just, you know, dumbing it down a little bit and making it fun and lighthearted, you don't have to know anything about politics really to follow our page. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=507.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, I don't do very newsy stuff. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=516.52s)]
*  You know, I don't comment on the latest thing of the day. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=519.44s)]
*  I didn't say anything about Hunter yesterday. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=521.76s)]
*  It's more just cultural. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=523.76s)]
*  It's, you know, men can't get pregnant. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=525.48s)]
*  Covid was ridiculous, you know, and everyone kind of agrees or at least a lot of people. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=527.52s)]
*  All right, so let me ask you a little bit about the kind of substance of your politics and the political message that you are conveying, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=533.64s)]
*  because I saw a bunch of your videos in preparation for our interview. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=541.28s)]
*  And there's, you know, you definitely are. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=544.4s)]
*  A lot of it is kind of light and humorous, but there's also definitely commentary on culture, but then also on politics. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=546.4s)]
*  And I think one of the things that people never realized about Trump in his 2016 campaign and now have forgotten, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=555.44s)]
*  even the people who did realize it at the time, was that obviously he was not a standard Republican Party candidate, to put that very mildly. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=561.76s)]
*  In fact, he was heaping scorn and contempt on the Republican Party establishment, at least as much as the Democratic Party establishment, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=569.6s)]
*  starting with Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio and all those big donors and the like, which he called the swamp. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=577.04s)]
*  And but even in the general election, he was doing the same and not just heaping scorn on them, but also their orthodoxy and dogma on foreign policy, on economic policy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  One of the things I did note is about your political commentary is that it's that's very similar, I think, is that you spend a lot of time either denouncing the Republican Party establishment, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=590.96s)]
*  but even more so the kind of standard dogma and orthodoxy that the party, the establishment wing has long pushed in and sold. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  What do you see as the big differences between this kind of Trumpian, more populist, anti-establishment faction of Republican Party politics and say the Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan establishment wing? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=612.08s)]
*  Yeah, so I think it all comes back to the 2015 Trump announcement speech. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=627.04s)]
*  And then that segued into the 2016 campaign, which was based around basically this war on political correctness and the three biggest policies of anti-war, pro-trade, pro-tariffs and the crackdown on immigration. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=632.16s)]
*  Illegal at the time and also a little bit of legal, but build the wall. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=649.8399999999999s)]
*  We're going to protect our industry and we're bringing the troops back from Afghanistan and wherever else they shouldn't be. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=655.04s)]
*  I think those were the three big themes and the Republican establishment at the time had abandoned those. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, after the Romney loss, they thought we need to double down on immigration to win Hispanics. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=668.08s)]
*  It's like Trump took the hardest position on immigration in a long time and actually did better with Hispanics. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=673.12s)]
*  Everything they said was a lie. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=679.52s)]
*  And I think he actually made it a more working class party, which is good. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=681.12s)]
*  You know, I think Republicans championing the working class and being for the American worker and wanting to impose steel tariffs, I think that's a good place to be. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=686.0s)]
*  I think it's good for us. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=693.5999999999999s)]
*  It's good for industry. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=695.28s)]
*  So that was the biggest break. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=696.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=699.5999999999999s)]
*  And then when you just look at everything from 2016 or 2015, I think you're right that people forget that part of it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=699.8399999999999s)]
*  Beating Hillary was a huge deal. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=706.8s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=708.64s)]
*  But the real thing was each week, each debate in the Republican primary, him taking down each person one by one, week after week. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=709.84s)]
*  That was the battle. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=719.84s)]
*  You know, those people that were in the trenches then, they know like that was the center of the universe. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=721.12s)]
*  That was really the we're going to take down the machine and we're going to have this insurgency and do things a little differently. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=726.4s)]
*  And it was really exciting to be a part of it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=733.6s)]
*  I hope we can get some of that back. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=735.6s)]
*  You know, maybe some of it is coming back. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  But to kind of just, you know, rebuke the Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, we're just the, you know, establishment GOP that got us into Iraq and all these other problems. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=739.6s)]
*  And it's like, no, we're not doing that anymore. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=748.96s)]
*  None of this makes sense. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=750.96s)]
*  We're going to be a party for the worker, you know, common sense. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=751.92s)]
*  We're not going to let the war machine rage on. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=755.28s)]
*  It was just exciting. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=758.88s)]
*  It was a cool time. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=759.76s)]
*  And yeah, I'm happy I could be a part of it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=760.56s)]
*  So that's what's so interesting. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=763.36s)]
*  And I want to show a video of yours that reflects what I'm about to ask you even more. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=764.48s)]
*  So because all that that you said, maybe except for immigration, but we should do a lot more to protect the American worker. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=768.16s)]
*  We should get out of endless wars. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=777.68s)]
*  For a long time, this was a message that I would say was more associated with, say, the American left, like the real American left, not the Democratic Party hacks and establishment wings. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=780.0s)]
*  And one of the points I've been trying to make for so long that ruptured a lot of my relationship with people on the left, not all but a lot, was that there's actually a lot more overlap between, say, this new populist right and what had been considered the traditional left on things like foreign policy and how Washington works. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=790.48s)]
*  Tucker Carlson once said that nobody wrote meaner articles about him 10 and 12 and 14 years ago that hurt him more than I did. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=809.28s)]
*  I hated him so much and he hated me. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=818.0s)]
*  And now I spend a lot of time on the Tucker Carlson show when he was on Fox and, you know, in other areas as well. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=820.16s)]
*  And we find that we have a huge amount of overlap, not because he changed or because I did, but because sort of the context of politics did as well. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=826.48s)]
*  So let me show this TikTok video that you did about foreign policy and American domestic policy. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=833.04s)]
*  It's obviously a right wing message in a way you consider yourself a Trump supporter. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=839.6s)]
*  But let's just listen to this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=843.6s)]
*  I want to give the audience kind of a taste of it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=844.9599999999999s)]
*  Welcome to America where we can't afford health care, but we can somehow afford to bomb the shit out of the Middle East. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=847.68s)]
*  All right. So that idea, I'm telling you, like 15 years ago, you could have gone to any left wing convention party organizing meeting. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=856.88s)]
*  And everyone there would have loved the message that, oh, we can bomb the shit out of all these other countries. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=865.68s)]
*  We can spend billions of dollars on war and yet we can't afford health care. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=871.44s)]
*  Do you do you see as somebody who's kind of been around for a while now in both these mainstream political venues and now in these newer ones, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=879.28s)]
*  a kind of change in how left versus right is understood and anti-establishment versus pro-establishment? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=889.44s)]
*  How do you see the political framework as I just described it? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=895.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a big tent that nobody's really tapping into yet. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=902.8s)]
*  That is the left and the right. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=907.36s)]
*  I think this sort of establishment center is small and a minority. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=908.88s)]
*  And yet those things are still getting pushed through. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=914.3199999999999s)]
*  When you look at the A to Ukraine or any of these things, it's like these are almost 80, 20 issues. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=916.8s)]
*  Everyone is against this. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=923.12s)]
*  Mike Johnson pushed that through. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=924.24s)]
*  Ninety five percent of Republicans are against it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=926.0s)]
*  He just said, you know, I had an intel briefing. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=928.08s)]
*  You peasants at home, you don't know what I know. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=930.24s)]
*  You know, the typical the typical things. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=932.4s)]
*  And I think when it comes down to government, it's just about priorities. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=934.72s)]
*  And, you know, is our government working for us? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=938.08s)]
*  Is it working for these other countries? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=941.12s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=943.2s)]
*  You know, we protect Germany and yet they have health care. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=943.92s)]
*  So we're indirectly subsidizing German health care. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=947.28s)]
*  You know, just kind of rethinking how these things work. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=950.24s)]
*  Where are monies being spent? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=953.12s)]
*  Who's actually in charge? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=954.72s)]
*  Is the American government working for us? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=956.64s)]
*  The American citizen? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=958.8s)]
*  As of late, not really. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=961.68s)]
*  So just kind of rethinking that. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=963.84s)]
*  And I think there's a broad coalition there that people need to tap into. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=965.52s)]
*  So one of the arguments that you are making regarding Ukraine is one that I've had. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=969.92s)]
*  I've heard from many conservative members of Congress who I've had on my show, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=974.96s)]
*  conservative presidential candidates. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=979.84s)]
*  It's a very common view, as you said, in the Republican Party politics, which is, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=981.92s)]
*  look, we're massively in debt. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=986.4799999999999s)]
*  Our communities here at home are ravaged. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=988.16s)]
*  People don't have health care. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=991.04s)]
*  How can we justify spending massive amounts financing the military and wards of other countries? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=992.56s)]
*  And they are very assertive about applying that when it comes to explaining why they're [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=997.8399999999999s)]
*  opposed to the U.S. financing of Ukraine. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  And the question I've asked every single one of them is, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1005.76s)]
*  do you apply that same rationale when it comes to the U.S. financing of Israel, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1008.16s)]
*  also a country that has millions of citizens with a much higher standard of living than [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1013.36s)]
*  millions of citizens of the United States, even though we pay for their military on top [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1017.76s)]
*  of them paying for all their new wars? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1021.92s)]
*  Do you see those two countries as similar or do you have this kind of Israel and this [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1024.24s)]
*  special place where none of those principles apply? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1029.84s)]
*  No, they're very similar. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1034.56s)]
*  I think it's funny that we keep saying, well, these are just loans. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1036.16s)]
*  It's like, so we're taking a loan from China to give to these countries. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  Why doesn't China just loan them the money? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  Of course, it's a loan that's never going to be paid back. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1045.68s)]
*  I don't think we need to be doing that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1048.0s)]
*  I think we need to be neutral in every conflict and then see what's best for our country and [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1050.24s)]
*  go from there. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1055.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1056.3200000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you just a couple more questions in the time that we have. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1056.5600000000002s)]
*  Actually, I want to ask you about the TikTok ban in a second. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1063.28s)]
*  But before I get to that, so we were talking about Trump's 2016 campaign, kind of this [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1065.12s)]
*  anti-establishment messaging. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1069.12s)]
*  And I think it's fair to say even a lot of his most loyal supporters will concede this [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1070.9599999999998s)]
*  that a lot of what happened in his administration in terms of policy and the like did not necessarily [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1080.08s)]
*  correspond to a lot of that anti-establishment rhetoric, including, for example, putting [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1085.12s)]
*  very hardcore neocon establishment, Republican types and positions of high power with foreign [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1090.1599999999999s)]
*  policy like Mike Pompeo at the CIA and then the State Department, Nikki Haley being the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1095.12s)]
*  U.N. ambassador to the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1100.24s)]
*  Trump has made some statements, including, you're talking about Mike Johnson pushing [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1104.32s)]
*  the Ukraine bill through. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1107.6s)]
*  He has said, and I think Trump has also said that he kind of maybe not necessarily agreeing [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  with everything Mike Johnson did, but gave him the sort of green light because he thinks [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1115.12s)]
*  it's important for Republicans to be cohesive heading into the election. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1118.64s)]
*  Do you agree that there was a lot of stuff that Trump did in his actual presidency that [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1122.16s)]
*  didn't correspond to the rhetoric? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1126.88s)]
*  And do you have any real belief that it will be different this time? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1135.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think when you run that type of campaign in 2016, I was pretty young and I was naive. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1136.0800000000002s)]
*  I showed up to the White House on the first day and was like, are we building the wall now? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we're a little disappointed. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1146.4s)]
*  There was a course correction. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1148.96s)]
*  He actually put me in charge of personnel and we were able to do a lot of good. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1150.3200000000002s)]
*  It was unfortunately the last year and we were kind of planning for a second term that I knew [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1153.92s)]
*  would have been better off. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1158.16s)]
*  We'll see if what we do with Project 2025 and some of the other groups, everything we've [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1160.3200000000002s)]
*  learned, are we going to use that? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1167.68s)]
*  Are we going to use that asset now and do things right this way? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1168.96s)]
*  I think so. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1172.48s)]
*  I hope it's up to him to decide, but we're already. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1173.2s)]
*  I think all those people that served in junior roles that were really, really good that nobody [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1177.36s)]
*  knows about can take on more senior roles. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1181.76s)]
*  I think we do know who the bad people are and who the good people are, but at the end of [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1184.32s)]
*  the day, it's his decision and how far he wants to go is up to him. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1187.84s)]
*  I think if you ask every single Republican in the country right now to describe America, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1193.84s)]
*  they would say it's degenerate, bankrupt, on the wrong track, this, that, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1198.32s)]
*  about to decline, about to implode. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1205.2s)]
*  It's like, okay, so when we win in November, do you think doubling up the border patrol [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1207.04s)]
*  agents and another round of tax cuts fixes that? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1212.56s)]
*  It's like, obviously not. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1215.52s)]
*  We have to do way, way more than that. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1216.56s)]
*  So let's get it right from the beginning. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1219.04s)]
*  With all these transition projects like the one I'm an advisor to at Heritage, there's [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1222.08s)]
*  an opportunity to do that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1226.32s)]
*  So we'll see and go from there. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1227.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1229.76s)]
*  I do have to ask about this TikTok ban because this has been driving me crazy. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1230.08s)]
*  There's almost nobody on the American right who's opposed to it. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1234.3999999999999s)]
*  Trump in 2020 was supportive of it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1238.3999999999999s)]
*  He then got a kind of major donation from somebody who has a stake in TikTok and then [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1241.6799999999998s)]
*  he actually came out against it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1246.08s)]
*  I'm not saying that's necessarily the reason, just describing the series of events, but [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1247.6s)]
*  other than Trump, bizarrely, there's almost nobody on the American right or in the conservative [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1252.24s)]
*  wing of the Republican party and the Republican party who has been against the TikTok ban. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1256.48s)]
*  And the reason for that, of course, is that when it was originally presented, the justification [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1260.08s)]
*  was these kind of fear-mongering narratives about China. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1264.72s)]
*  Oh, China is our major adversary. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1268.3999999999999s)]
*  They're using TikTok to both propagandize our youth, to corrupt our culture, to spy [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1271.36s)]
*  on us and collect data on us. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1277.36s)]
*  And you have been very outspoken when it came to the TikTok ban. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1279.6s)]
*  Ben, I just wanted to read this paragraph, this passage from an op-ed that you wrote, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1286.0s)]
*  I think it was last month in the Los Angeles Daily News about this. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1290.24s)]
*  You said, quote, instead of taking all these facts into consideration that you laid out, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1293.44s)]
*  Republicans rushed to pass a bill that grants new censorship powers to the government. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1297.8400000000001s)]
*  Besides banning TikTok, the bill gives the president the ability to ban companies he [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1302.8000000000002s)]
*  says are acting at the direction of a foreign adversary. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1307.6000000000001s)]
*  After all, we've learned the last four years about how the government pressured media [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1310.48s)]
*  companies to censor legitimate speech about COVID. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1314.1599999999999s)]
*  It boggles my mind that Republicans would vote to give President Biden new censorship [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1316.6399999999999s)]
*  powers. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1321.36s)]
*  The bottom line is Republicans got played because they wanted to act like they're tough [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1321.76s)]
*  on China. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1325.9199999999998s)]
*  In election year, they gave the Biden administration and Facebook exactly what they wanted. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1326.32s)]
*  Now 170 million Americans will have to pay the price for their political theater. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1330.32s)]
*  You know the arguments against TikTok, the ones I ran through that China [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1337.9199999999998s)]
*  has direct access to our youth, they can use to collect data on us. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1343.6s)]
*  Eventually, actually the real reason it passed was because a lot of Democrats became convinced [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1348.8799999999999s)]
*  that there was too much anti-Israel speech allowed on the platform and that was why so [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1353.9199999999998s)]
*  many young Americans became critical of Israel in the war and that we can't allow. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1358.0s)]
*  Such an obvious attack on free speech after Republicans waved the free speech banner for [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1363.28s)]
*  so long. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1367.28s)]
*  But what do you make of those arguments, the ones that were the most common ones used to [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1368.32s)]
*  justify this bill? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1372.0s)]
*  They don't hold water. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1374.56s)]
*  So they'll say, well China can infiltrate the algorithm. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1376.24s)]
*  Well there's no instance of them ever doing that. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1379.76s)]
*  They'll say, well the Chinese government can access American user data. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1382.24s)]
*  Okay, show us the example. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1386.08s)]
*  That's never actually happened. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1387.6799999999998s)]
*  When the Trump administration raised these concerns, TikTok moved all their data to the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1390.32s)]
*  U.S. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1394.8s)]
*  They walled it off. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1395.28s)]
*  They put third party oversight. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1396.24s)]
*  They put it with Oracle. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1397.84s)]
*  You know they did all these things and it's like, wait, why is this still going on? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1399.1999999999998s)]
*  It's like, oh because this is a political thing. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1402.64s)]
*  You know Republicans want to act like they're tough on China and Democrats want new power. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1405.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like where were these Republican senators super tough on China when Trump wanted to do [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1410.4s)]
*  the tariffs? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1415.5200000000002s)]
*  They were nowhere to be found. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1416.0s)]
*  Where were these serious national security people when we wanted to build the wall? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1417.5200000000002s)]
*  Nowhere to be found. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1421.68s)]
*  So it's just another thing, another hoax. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1423.68s)]
*  The national security state just marches on and people say, well it's bipartisan. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1427.1200000000001s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1431.5200000000002s)]
*  All politicians love to use fear and scare tactics. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1432.96s)]
*  It's why Democrats love COVID. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1436.8000000000002s)]
*  It's why Republicans love war. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1438.5600000000002s)]
*  So they found this new Chinese boogeyman and they're going to use it any way they can to [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1440.88s)]
*  get more control, whether that's new censorship powers or to just overall censor speech and [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1444.88s)]
*  content they don't like. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1450.96s)]
*  Like you mentioned, when we saw the congressmen and senators on the House floor, all they [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1452.0s)]
*  talked about was the fact that TikTok had a lot of content, you know, critical of Ukraine aid or [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1456.56s)]
*  pro-Palestine or hashtags they didn't like. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1462.48s)]
*  And it's like, okay, so this is really just content moderation. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1465.12s)]
*  And you think by banning this app that solves that. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1469.28s)]
*  And we're giving them new powers to ban everything else. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1471.6s)]
*  Why can't they say Twitter is acting at the direction of Russia or rumble or Telegram is [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1475.36s)]
*  because they're being critical of this war? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1480.72s)]
*  I think Republicans just fell for it. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1484.24s)]
*  And I don't believe that Trump had, I don't think it had anything to do with what you [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1485.92s)]
*  mentioned. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1488.64s)]
*  I think he's actually never fallen for the national security hysteria things. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1488.96s)]
*  And I think that's because he's been on the other side of it, whether it was the Russia [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1493.44s)]
*  hoax or anything else, you know, being tough on China to him is trade and tariffs and, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1496.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, protecting industry. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1502.0800000000002s)]
*  It's not making up these fake things to empower the deep state. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1503.52s)]
*  And, you know, yeah, I think hopefully with Trump being on TikTok and winning in November, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1508.3200000000002s)]
*  maybe that'll be a mandate to kind of overturn this somehow. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1513.36s)]
*  I don't know how that works. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1516.24s)]
*  I'm hoping for that because everyone loves TikTok. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1517.36s)]
*  And I think it's just opening the door to way too much power for the government. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1519.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  I still laugh to this day about how Trump was constantly attacked and still is for [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1524.3999999999999s)]
*  supposedly trusting the word of the Russian government above our sacred U.S. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1530.6399999999999s)]
*  intelligence community was such a long history of only telling the truth when it came to [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1534.6399999999999s)]
*  things like Russia gate. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1539.28s)]
*  And of course, that turned out to be false or that he didn't even mention the story of [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1540.8s)]
*  Russia putting bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1545.84s)]
*  And they tried to imply that that was because he was beholden to Putin when, in fact, he [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1549.04s)]
*  knew from the beginning, this story just intuitively was bullshit. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1552.8799999999999s)]
*  And of course, it was proven to be. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1555.6s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1557.52s)]
*  He's obviously more skeptical of the U.S. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1558.32s)]
*  security state than almost any president since I would say the national security state was [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1560.0s)]
*  created in the wake of World War II. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1565.44s)]
*  And that's obviously why the U.S. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1567.84s)]
*  security state hates him so much. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1569.84s)]
*  Just one or two more questions. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1571.52s)]
*  In that op-ed that I mentioned, you had a sentence where you said Republicans, quote, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1574.32s)]
*  haven't done a single thing in the last five years on the most important tech issue, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1579.52s)]
*  the censorship of conservatives. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1584.56s)]
*  Why do you say that that's the most important tech issue, the censorship of conservatives? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1586.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, being a conservative, you know, you see your representatives wanting to take on big [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1592.48s)]
*  tech. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1597.6s)]
*  Well, big tech is Facebook and Google. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1598.24s)]
*  And what are they doing? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1600.32s)]
*  And what's the most harmful thing they're doing? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1601.12s)]
*  I think it's been the deplatforming of conservatives. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1603.36s)]
*  I think it was banning the sitting president of the United States. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that's the free speech issue of our time. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1610.0s)]
*  And what are they doing on it? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1612.9599999999998s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  Instead, they're doing Facebook's bidding by taking out their top competitor. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  When I was working there, I mentioned the op-ed that, you know, we tried to, well, we [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1618.9599999999998s)]
*  actually rescinded the FCC nomination of somebody who went against President Trump's order, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1623.36s)]
*  you know, social media order. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1628.1599999999999s)]
*  And they threw a fit. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1629.36s)]
*  We saw it through, but it was too late. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1631.36s)]
*  We were trying to, you know, get some Section 230 reform or whatever. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1632.9599999999998s)]
*  But these congressmen and senators threw an absolute fit. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1636.6399999999999s)]
*  They don't believe in the things we believe. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1639.6799999999998s)]
*  They don't care about the actual issues that matter to conservatives. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1641.76s)]
*  They want to just play and go on Fox News and talk tough about China. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1645.04s)]
*  It's embarrassing, honestly. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1649.9199999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1651.36s)]
*  Last question. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1651.6s)]
*  I asked you before whether you apply these foreign policy principles about funding Ukraine [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1652.5600000000002s)]
*  to Israel, and you very consistently said, absolutely. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1657.52s)]
*  Let me ask you the same thing about free speech because you mentioned free speech of conservatives. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1661.52s)]
*  I think one of the reasons, there are many reasons, but one of the reasons why I have [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1665.44s)]
*  a lot more conservatives in my audience than I had previously is because I have been defending [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1668.48s)]
*  the free speech rights of right-wing and conservative speech, denouncing censorship aimed at them online [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1672.96s)]
*  and offline. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1678.24s)]
*  But one of the things that has been driving me mad, and I mean mad in both senses of the term, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1679.6000000000001s)]
*  angry and insane, is that so many of these Republicans who have been waving the free [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1684.5600000000002s)]
*  speech banner since October 7th have been demanding that people be fired because of [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1689.2800000000002s)]
*  their views on Israel and then supporting legislation that expands the definition of [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1695.2s)]
*  anti-Semitism to include a whole bunch of views that are very commonly expressed about Israel. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1699.3600000000001s)]
*  Has the post-October 7th flurry of kind of cancel culture, as we once called it, the [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1705.2800000000002s)]
*  demanding of people being fired for their views, but also the kind of formalizing of [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1710.8000000000002s)]
*  this censorship regime now apply to Israel critics? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1714.72s)]
*  Is that also a concern of yours? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1717.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it goes hand in hand. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1722.16s)]
*  I think it's the same thing. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1723.76s)]
*  You see that the media took a very pro-Israel stance. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1725.2s)]
*  So when you have the media on your side, all of these right-wing people got very empowered [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1730.16s)]
*  to go hard against the left, whether it was the campus protest or calling for de-platforming [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1734.48s)]
*  left-wing people. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1740.56s)]
*  It's just funny to see when the media is on your side, you can be very tough and very strong, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1743.76s)]
*  but where were these people when it was the BLM riots? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1751.1200000000001s)]
*  Where were all these tough guys then? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1754.4s)]
*  And that's because the media wasn't on the side of us, on the right-wing side. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1756.24s)]
*  So yeah, of course, I'm not on the side of some leftist campus protester. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1760.32s)]
*  We probably disagree on almost everything. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1764.8s)]
*  But on this particular issue, I mean, yeah, they have free speech. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1768.88s)]
*  They're allowed to exercise that right. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1771.52s)]
*  So I really appreciate coming on. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1773.6s)]
*  I did have a kind of suspicion that even though I don't pay a lot of attention to TikTok, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1775.44s)]
*  that the discourse going on there is different than the discourse going on elsewhere. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1778.88s)]
*  And I think having listened to you now for half an hour or so describe your views as a [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1784.32s)]
*  Trump supporter, as a self-identified conservative, it kind of confirms that suspicion. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1788.88s)]
*  I'm sure there are a lot of people in our audience who haven't given much thought to TikTok, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1795.6000000000001s)]
*  even though it is arguably the most influential platform in the country at this point. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1798.88s)]
*  So I appreciate you coming on and not just sharing your political views, but also giving [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  us a sort of glimpse into how that world works. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1807.68s)]
*  It was great talking to you, and I appreciate your time. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1810.48s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much for having me. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woWa2u0o26k&t=1813.44s)]
