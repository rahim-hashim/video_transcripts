# Why Are Americans So Uniquely Provoked by Israelâ€”A Foreign Country? | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8)
*  I think it's worth asking why, why do so many American, why is it for so many Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=0.0s)]
*  when this issue arises, all bets are off and the passions get enlivened over Israel, a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=12.16s)]
*  foreign country like no other. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=21.04s)]
*  And it's a very uncomfortable question for a lot of people to ask and to try and answer [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=25.6s)]
*  because it requires you to say things that have been placed off limits and made taboo. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=29.02s)]
*  But it's an important question and it's a question that I think requires discussion [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=34.54s)]
*  because it's obviously true. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=40.76s)]
*  There are people who have not talked about anything else since October 7th and I'm one [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=42.7s)]
*  of them because so many people are focused only on it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=48.18s)]
*  It's very difficult not to and this is an American war by virtue of everything we just [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=51.06s)]
*  talked about. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=55.14s)]
*  So let me just go over a few reasons. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=57.98s)]
*  There isn't just one or two, there are several. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=60.14s)]
*  Why Israel has become so significant, so at the forefront of the interest of so many American [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=63.68s)]
*  people who live thousands of miles away from Israel, who live on the other side of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  world in this foreign country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=75.02s)]
*  And yet, obviously regarded with the greatest intensity, the most amount of passion you [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=78.6s)]
*  could see for any other political debate. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=84.5s)]
*  So first of all is the big elephant in the room which is that the United States has a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=88.58s)]
*  lot of American Jews in it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=91.86s)]
*  It's the country that has the most amount of American Jews outside of Israel of anywhere [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=94.66s)]
*  in the world, millions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=97.72s)]
*  And as an American Jew myself and somebody who had a very kind of standard upbringing, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=101.06s)]
*  Jewish upbringing in the United States, everyone in my family is Jewish. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  My parents are Jewish, the three grandparents that I knew were Jewish, my fourth grandparent [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=113.42s)]
*  was too, he just died before I was born, so all four of my grandparents were Jewish. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=120.22s)]
*  My grandmother was actually a refugee from Germany, she was a German Jew. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=125.18s)]
*  She and her younger sister fled anti-Semitism under Hitler in Germany in the late 1930s [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=130.3s)]
*  and came to the United States as refugees. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=136.06s)]
*  And the rest of her family who remained were all killed in the Holocaust. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=139.46s)]
*  My grandmother had a thick German accent until the day she died. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=143.18s)]
*  I was very close to her. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=145.5s)]
*  And so I was inculcated with all the same things that American Jews, most almost all [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=147.5s)]
*  American Jews that I know and I think American Jews in general are inculcated with from birth. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=150.82s)]
*  Which is the idea that Israel is so important, that it's your duty to love Israel, it's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  your duty to be devoted to Israel, it's your duty to be committed to Israel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=161.66s)]
*  And then as you get older everything you do, going to synagogue, getting bar mitzvahed, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=166.58s)]
*  Israel pays for American Jews to go to Israel for free. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=171.74s)]
*  And when you get there they give you this big propaganda campaign very well planned [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=177.34s)]
*  about why Israel is so important to you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  They drum it into your head. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=183.38s)]
*  And everyone you're surrounded by, who you love, constantly tells you that Israel is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  so important. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=189.46s)]
*  Every one of my friends who's Jewish, which is most of them my lifelong friends, starting [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=190.46s)]
*  on October 7th, even ones who have been politically indifferent when it comes to Israel or even [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  kind of critical of Israel, got very radicalized very quickly overnight and said, no, we need [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=201.06s)]
*  to support Israel as a result of this Hamas attack. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=207.1s)]
*  And obviously there are a lot of American Jews, and American Jews are one of the highest [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=212.3s)]
*  earning groups in the United States. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=215.5s)]
*  There are a lot of powerful American Jews. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=217.54s)]
*  You've seen a lot of billionaires who are big supporters and donors to American colleges [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=219.3s)]
*  withdraw their funding and say we're not donating any more to you because you're insufficiently [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=224.38s)]
*  supportive of Israel because you allow too much pro-Palestinian activity on your campus. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=229.74s)]
*  Obviously there are a lot of American Jews in high positions of politics. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=235.74s)]
*  American Jews are a very secure and powerful group in the United States. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=238.58s)]
*  And that's part of it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=243.86s)]
*  American Jews are conditioned since childhood to love Israel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=244.86s)]
*  I asked Batya Ungar Sargon when she was on my show, because I know how she grew up. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=247.9s)]
*  I grew up like her. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=253.46s)]
*  Everyone I know who's Jewish grew up this way. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=254.46s)]
*  I said, I know you were taught since birth to feel so passionate for Israel. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=256.5s)]
*  Do you ever wonder is the reason I think this about Israel that I'm so supportive of Israel [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=264.46s)]
*  as an adult? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=269.38s)]
*  Is that because you've been told to, indoctrinated and inculcated with these ideas since childhood? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=270.5s)]
*  And she said it's an interesting question, but she's very supportive of Israel. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=277.84s)]
*  And I think that's one reason. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=281.1s)]
*  Another reason is that there is a huge evangelical population in the United States who, this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=284.9s)]
*  is a very recent phenomenon, have come to believe that it's vital to their religious [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=291.78s)]
*  beliefs for Israel to be united and strong, not just in what's considered Israel proper [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=296.82s)]
*  under international law, which are the post-1967 borders, but all of Israel. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=305.06s)]
*  They consider the West Bank, Gaza, even Jordan and other countries to be part of Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=310.38s)]
*  And a lot of Israeli, religious Israelis, believe that as well now too. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=315.18s)]
*  So in addition to American Jews, you have a lot of evangelicals whose pastors teach [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=319.7s)]
*  them that their duty is to support Israel, that Israel is a blessed nation biblically. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  And they don't really love Jews, but they do believe that Israel needs to be fully supported. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=330.26s)]
*  We've shown you some interviews that Lee Fong and others have conducted with evangelical [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=335.02s)]
*  members of Congress who explicitly say, I believe Israel and the United States are the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=338.74s)]
*  two blessed countries and that's why we need to stand with Israel for religious reasons. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=342.98s)]
*  And they're a big population, obviously a bigger population than American Jews. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  That's why so many red states in Texas and Louisiana and Alabama, all throughout the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=351.54s)]
*  South, have enacted laws saying, if you want to work for the state, you have to sign a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=356.26s)]
*  pledge of vowing that you won't boycott Israel. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=362.02s)]
*  You're free to boycott any other country in the world. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=365.86s)]
*  You're free to boycott other American states, you just can't boycott Israel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=368.82s)]
*  This is not American Jews doing that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  These are mostly evangelical conservatives doing that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  And then on top of that, you have the fact that Israel is a close partner for the US [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=378.06s)]
*  security state and long has been. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=383.62s)]
*  They fight wars together, they share intelligence. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=386.22s)]
*  The US has tried to dominate the Middle East because of oil for a long time and Israel [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  has been a partner in that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=393.26s)]
*  So the CIA, the Pentagon, all of these people embedded in the US security state see Israel [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=394.5s)]
*  as a vital ally. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=399.7s)]
*  They see Ukraine that way too, but they definitely see Israel that way also. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=404.14s)]
*  And then finally, you have this kind of conservative idea that emerged after 9-11 that the West [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=409.02s)]
*  is currently involved in a war of civilizations. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=417.42s)]
*  So you have the civilized white Christian, Judeo-Christian West on the one hand and then [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=420.66s)]
*  you have the Muslim hordes on the other. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=425.74s)]
*  And Judeo-Christian Westerners are advanced. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=429.66s)]
*  They have a high culture. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=434.90000000000003s)]
*  Now there are people who don't count Jews among this, but there's been a narrative evolution [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=435.90000000000003s)]
*  that says no, the West isn't Christian, the West is Judeo-Christian. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=444.26000000000005s)]
*  Jews are part of this elevated culture and they're fighting this primitive force of Muslims [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=447.34s)]
*  who don't believe in pluralism and religious liberty. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=455.17999999999995s)]
*  This is a big book by Samuel Harrington called The War of Civilizations that a lot of American [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=457.85999999999996s)]
*  conservatives embraced in the wake of 9-11, which is why they fought so many wars and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=463.94s)]
*  wanted to fight so many wars, because they see it as a civilization war. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=467.94s)]
*  And you have a lot of conservatives now supporting censorship in France and Germany and the UK [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=473.62s)]
*  not really even because they support censorship, but because they see it as a way of controlling [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=478.26s)]
*  the Muslim hordes who have invaded Europe. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=482.86s)]
*  That is absolutely part of why the American right has become so intensely supportive of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=484.82s)]
*  Israel even though at the same time they're saying we believe in America first and non-interventionism [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=490.98s)]
*  and not fighting wars. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=496.06s)]
*  Since October 7th, all bets are off. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=497.54s)]
*  They're very excited and animated by what they see as a civilization war. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  So you have four different groups, American Jews, Evangelicals, National Security Hawks, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=502.94s)]
*  and warriors on civilization. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=508.66s)]
*  And obviously there's a lot of overlap in those groups, but I think that's a major reason [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=511.34000000000003s)]
*  why Israel just occupies such an intense interest on the part of so many Americans even though [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=515.66s)]
*  it's a tiny foreign country on the other side of the world. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=524.62s)]
*  And as a result of how much investment there is on the part of the United States in Israel, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  you also have a lot of people who intensely focus on this conflict in terms of supporting Palestinians. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=537.3s)]
*  And one of the things that has been done over many decades to keep this consensus in place, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=546.1s)]
*  this bipartisan consensus of supporting Israel with money and military weapons and bombs [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=552.18s)]
*  and everything else, diplomatic cover, is to accuse anybody questioning this consensus [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=558.5799999999999s)]
*  of being racist, of being anti-Semitic. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=565.14s)]
*  As though you can't look at what's going on in Gaza. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=570.3s)]
*  The blockading of food and water, the stories of children getting infections and having [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=574.5s)]
*  limbs amputated because of infections from dirty water, having to be performed without [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=581.7399999999999s)]
*  anesthesia because hospitals can't get it, of surgeons trying to have surgery on children [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=586.86s)]
*  who are clinging to life while bombs are going off around them while the electricity is failing [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=595.3s)]
*  because the Israelis blockaded food, water, medication, and fuel from the beginning. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=599.34s)]
*  That there's no way you can look at these things, this immense suffering among innocent [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=607.9399999999999s)]
*  Palestinians, among babies, among children, and oppose it unless you hate Jews, unless [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=613.38s)]
*  you're anti-Semitic, unless you're racist. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=617.46s)]
*  And the irony of that tactic is that this is what conservatives say the left does. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=619.94s)]
*  This is what conservatives complain about leftists, about liberal leftists. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=625.9000000000001s)]
*  Oh, the minute you disagree with them, they call you racist. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=629.3000000000001s)]
*  They call you bigoted. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=633.0200000000001s)]
*  They call you transphobic. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=634.0200000000001s)]
*  They just call you names. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=635.0200000000001s)]
*  They say you're a racist to try and destroy your reputation and stifle debate. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=636.9000000000001s)]
*  What is this tactic? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=641.14s)]
*  Saying that anyone who questions US support for Israel, anyone who questions this horrific [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=643.4599999999999s)]
*  bloodshed in Gaza must hate Jews. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=647.8199999999999s)]
*  It's such a grotesque, dishonest tactic, just like when the American left runs around accusing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=654.66s)]
*  everybody who sees things differently with them as them of being a racist or a white [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=659.2199999999999s)]
*  nationalist, something we've objected to many times here. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=662.62s)]
*  It's just they become mirror images of each other, from the support for censorship, to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=666.7s)]
*  support for cancel culture, to support for victimhood narratives that we've covered many [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=672.1800000000001s)]
*  times over the last several weeks, but also this tactic of branding all of their opponents [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=677.22s)]
*  racist and anti-Semites. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUDKHXk-a8&t=683.46s)]
