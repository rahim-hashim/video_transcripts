# MAHA DIVIDED Over Surgeon General Pick
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM)
*  I do want to cover this last story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'll talk about the Ed Martin thing and the nomination of Judge Jeanine to take his place [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=8.56s)]
*  just briefly when we get to it, but this will be the last issue we really cover more or [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=14.68s)]
*  less in depth because I find it so interesting. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=19.48s)]
*  It seems like some callous intrigue and some interfactional drama, but I actually think [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=21.92s)]
*  it's a lot more than that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=27.48s)]
*  So Casey Means is somebody who went to medical school. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=28.94s)]
*  She went to Stanford, one of the best medical schools in the country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=36.02s)]
*  She apparently did well at medical school, but when she went into her residency, she [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=39.96s)]
*  dropped out before actually becoming licensed to practice law, the residency's requirement, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=44.1s)]
*  because she said she was very disillusioned with conventional science and medicine. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=48.66s)]
*  She didn't think the way doctors were learning or were treating patients was adequate, and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=54.62s)]
*  so she took a different path where she recommends a sort of worldview that's based on metabolic [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=60.82s)]
*  activity and believes that certain negative mental states can cause things like cancer [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=70.02s)]
*  and the like. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=77.7s)]
*  represent all of her views, but she's somebody who, to a lot of people, especially RFK Jr., [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=79.46000000000001s)]
*  has become a sort of icon or symbol of another way, a better way to think about health, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=87.62s)]
*  she had a lot of support, has a lot of support. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=94.26s)]
*  She tied herself very closely along with her brother, Cally Means, both of them have kind [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=96.14s)]
*  of become a spokespeople, public spokespeople for RFK's MAHA movement. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=101.9s)]
*  They appear on podcasts, they're both very articulate and well-spoken, and I was surprised [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=107.98s)]
*  actually that neither of them have been nominated for anything up until this point, because [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=115.18s)]
*  I assume both of them are going to be. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=118.7s)]
*  I mean, they're very closely aligned with RFK Jr., they become among his leading spokespeople [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=120.26s)]
*  on podcasts and cable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=125.18s)]
*  And yesterday, Trump chose Casey Means, the one who went to medical school but didn't [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=128.5s)]
*  finish her residency, as Surgeon General. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=134.26s)]
*  Here was his announcement on True Social. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=137.14s)]
*  Quote, I am pleased to announce that Dr. Casey Means will be nominated as our next Surgeon [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=138.66s)]
*  General of the United States of America. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=143.22s)]
*  Casey has impeccable MAHA credentials and will work closely with our wonderful Secretary [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=145.06s)]
*  of Health and Human Services, RFK Jr., to ensure a successful implementation of our [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=149.94s)]
*  agenda in order to reverse the chronic disease epidemic and ensure great health in the future [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=154.74s)]
*  for all Americans. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=159.62s)]
*  Her academic achievements, together with her life's work, are absolutely outstanding. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=160.74s)]
*  Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=164.5s)]
*  history. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  Congratulations to Casey. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  Senator Kennedy looks forward to working with Dr. Jeanette Nezowit in another capacity at [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  HHS. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=177.06s)]
*  I think she was somebody who was originally going to be chosen as Surgeon General, and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=178.46s)]
*  she was withdrawn, and then Casey Means was the new announcement. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=183.82s)]
*  Now, I had assumed, based on my observations and reporting as well on MAHA, we've had RFK [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=187.17999999999998s)]
*  Jr. on our show, I talked to a lot of people in that circle, that she would be a popular [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=194.78s)]
*  choice among RFK Jr.'s supporters and allies in the MAHA movement because of how closely [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=200.06s)]
*  she's been aligned with and how vocal and supportive she's been of RFK. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=207.34s)]
*  The Hill today said that Trump chose her in large part on RFK Jr.'s recommendation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  There's the headline, Trump chose new Surgeon General pick on RFK Jr.'s recommendation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump was asked why he chose Casey Means, a physician turned wellness influencer, with [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=223.82s)]
*  close ties to the MAHA movement as his new pick to fulfill the role. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=229.34s)]
*  And Trump said, quote, because Bobby thought she's fantastic. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  She's a brilliant woman who went through Stanford. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=236.54s)]
*  As I understand it, she basically wanted to be an academic as opposed to a surgeon. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=238.78s)]
*  Bobby really thought she was great. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=242.7s)]
*  I don't know her. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=244.14s)]
*  I listened to the recommendation of Bobby. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=244.94s)]
*  I met her yesterday and once before. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=246.62s)]
*  She's a very, very outstanding person, a great academic, actually, so I think she'll be great. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  Casey Means, a graduate of Stanford Medical School, is the sister of Kaylee Means, a close [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=252.54s)]
*  kind of the ally and a special government employee at HHS. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=256.94s)]
*  Casey Means is the co-founder of Levels, a health technology company that focuses on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=260.86s)]
*  tracking health information through devices like continuous glucose monitors. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=265.02s)]
*  So I thought, OK, that's an RFK person. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=271.02s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=273.97999999999996s)]
*  And yet there was a lot of negative reaction, very intense negative reaction, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=276.78s)]
*  to the choice of Casey Means to be Surgeon General and not from [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=283.26s)]
*  conventional Republicans who hate RFK or from Democrats or any of that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  It came from RFK Jr.'s allies, many of them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=293.42s)]
*  And the leading one was Nicole Shanahan, who, as you may recall, when RFK Jr. was running [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=299.42s)]
*  for president as an independent, he named her as his running mate. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=308.22s)]
*  The assumption at the time was he did so because she's a billionaire. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=313.1s)]
*  She is the ex-wife of Google founder Sergey Breen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=316.86s)]
*  In that divorce, she got roughly a billion dollars, maybe a little more. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=321.74s)]
*  Not really sure the exact amount, but she's definitely a billionaire. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=326.21999999999997s)]
*  When you're running as an independent, you need somebody to finance your campaign. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  If your vice president happens to be a billionaire, that's really good news because [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=331.74s)]
*  she can fund your campaign. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=336.14s)]
*  And in fact, she gave many millions of dollars, I think $21 million, something like that, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=337.5s)]
*  maybe more, to RFK Jr.'s campaign. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=342.78s)]
*  She was chosen for that reason, though. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=347.34s)]
*  I had assumed that she was basically chosen only for that reason. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=348.54s)]
*  She was not a person of substance. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=351.82s)]
*  And then I interviewed her on this show. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=353.26000000000005s)]
*  I spent a good amount of time interviewing her. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=354.86s)]
*  And I actually walked away impressed, and I've been impressed ever since. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=356.86s)]
*  I take her seriously as a political figure, as a person. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=360.54s)]
*  I don't defer to her views. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  She said some things I don't agree with at all. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=367.98s)]
*  But she's not just a money figure. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  I think she has a very interesting, developed thoughts about the world. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=374.06s)]
*  She is successful in her own right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=379.66s)]
*  She was a Silicon Valley lawyer. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=382.86s)]
*  I think she's very smart. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=385.98s)]
*  So this is what she said in response to the announcement of Casey Means as Surgeon General. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=387.02s)]
*  She said this, quote, it's very strange. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=395.74s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=398.38s)]
*  I was promised that if I supported RFK Jr. in his Senate confirmation, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  that neither of these siblings would be working under HHS or in an appointment. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=405.9s)]
*  And that much more qualified people would be. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=411.58s)]
*  Now, a lot of people were saying, like, what role did you play in RFK's confirmation? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=413.58s)]
*  Like, you don't have any standing in the Senate. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=419.34s)]
*  But the reality is she did, because she threatened any Republican senator [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  who voted against RFK that she would pour a ton of money into funding a primary challenge. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=426.85999999999996s)]
*  And that is something. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=433.41999999999996s)]
*  When a billionaire says that to senators who are wobbling on this question of whether to vote for [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  RFK Jr., remember, he had almost no margin. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=441.58s)]
*  If only one or two Republican senators abandoned him because of a close divide in the Senate, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=444.53999999999996s)]
*  his nomination would have failed. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=450.06s)]
*  And so she said, look, I'm going to support you, but I want your assurance. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=452.38000000000005s)]
*  She said this is the assurance that she sought and received from RFK Jr. directly, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=456.78000000000003s)]
*  that if he's confirmed, neither of these siblings, not Casey Means nor Kaylee Means, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  would get any kind of appointment or work in HHS. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=468.70000000000005s)]
*  She said, instead, much more people who are much more qualified would be. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=471.42s)]
*  And Kaylee Means is now a special employee to HHS. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=476.86s)]
*  I don't know if the whole Shanahan considers that to be a violation, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=480.62s)]
*  but she certainly considers a violation of the promise [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=485.42s)]
*  that she got from RFK Jr. to have appointed Casey Means as Surgeon General. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=489.02s)]
*  And this is what she went on to say, quote, I don't know if RFK very clearly lied to me [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=494.62s)]
*  or what is going on. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=500.62s)]
*  It has been clear in recent conversations that he is reporting to someone regularly [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=502.14s)]
*  who is controlling his decisions, and that person is not President Trump. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=506.7s)]
*  With regard to the siblings, there is something very artificial and aggressive about them, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=512.54s)]
*  almost like they were bred and raised as Manchurian assets. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=516.7s)]
*  Now, that's quite a list of statements. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=522.78s)]
*  And I think the most serious one is she's saying that RFK Jr. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=526.7s)]
*  is not somebody who has the normal powers of a Health and Human Services Secretary. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=530.38s)]
*  He doesn't make his own decisions. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=541.66s)]
*  He has to report to and is controlled by someone else who's not President Trump. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=542.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think the obvious reference there is to Bill Cassidy, who himself is a physician [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=548.22s)]
*  and was extremely skeptical of RFK Jr.'s nomination by Trump to be HHS Secretary. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=555.42s)]
*  He was deeply offended by and stridently opposed to RFK Jr.'s questioning of or skepticism toward [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=563.5s)]
*  vaccines. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=571.1s)]
*  He hates the anti-vax movement or anything that can be closely associated with it, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=572.14s)]
*  which he thinks is RFK Jr. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=577.42s)]
*  And just other parts of Bill Cassidy, even as a politician, a very swampy, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=579.9s)]
*  uniparty establishment type of politician, very old school establishment, GOP, not at all, MAGA. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=585.26s)]
*  They needed his vote. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=595.02s)]
*  If they lost his vote, which they were very close to losing, then RFK Jr.'s nomination would have [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=596.06s)]
*  failed. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=602.4599999999999s)]
*  And Bill Cassidy very openly said, if you want my vote, you need to agree to a long list of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=603.3399999999999s)]
*  limitations of what you can do, and you will be required to meet with me regularly and to include [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=612.54s)]
*  me in decision making. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=621.5s)]
*  And if you don't, I'm going to call you before this committee and there will be repercussions. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=622.54s)]
*  And in order to get his vote, RFK agreed to these constraints. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=626.6999999999999s)]
*  And here is Bill Cassidy when announcing his decision to vote for RFK Jr. saying that he got [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=630.7s)]
*  huge, very extraordinary and unusual concessions from RFK about limitations on his power and the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=636.54s)]
*  role that Bill Cassidy particularly would play in all HHS decision making. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=644.78s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed that he and I would have an unprecedentedly [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=649.9s)]
*  close collaborative working relationship if he is confirmed. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=655.42s)]
*  We will meet or speak multiple times a month. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=659.34s)]
*  This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore to be more effective. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=662.7s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy has asked for my input into hiring decisions at HHS beyond Senate confirmed positions [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=667.5s)]
*  and he has also committed that he had worked within current vaccine approval and safety [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=673.82s)]
*  monitoring systems and not established parallel systems. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=678.7s)]
*  It confirmed he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=682.78s)]
*  Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations without changes. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=687.74s)]
*  CDC will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=692.38s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy and the administration also committed that this administration will not use the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=699.66s)]
*  subversive techniques used under the Biden administration like sue and settle to change [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=704.46s)]
*  policies enacted by Congress without first going through Congress. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=709.74s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed to a strong role of Congress. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=715.26s)]
*  Aside from he and I meeting regularly, he will come before the Help Committee on a quarterly [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=719.02s)]
*  basis if requested. He committed that the Help Committee chair, whether it's me or someone else, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=723.74s)]
*  may choose a representative on any board or commission formed to review vaccine safety. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=729.9000000000001s)]
*  If he is confirmed, HHS will provide a 30-day notice to the Help Committee if the agency seeks [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=736.22s)]
*  to make changes to any of our federal vaccine safety monitoring programs and Help Committee [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=741.82s)]
*  will have the option to call a hearing to further review. If Mr. Kennedy is confirmed, I will use [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=747.9000000000001s)]
*  my authority as chairman of the Senate committee with oversight of HHS to rebuff any attempt to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=753.2600000000001s)]
*  remove the public's access to life-saving vaccines without iron-clad, causational, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=759.1s)]
*  scientific evidence that can be accepted and defended before the mainstream scientific community [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=766.94s)]
*  and before Congress. These commitments and my expectation that we can have a great working [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=774.46s)]
*  relationship to make America healthy again is the basis of my support. He will be the secretary, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=780.86s)]
*  but I believe he will also be a partner in working for this end. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=787.98s)]
*  Now I find that extremely creepy and I don't know if you noticed the graphic on the right side of [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=794.7s)]
*  the screen which is also extremely creepy. I don't know if this is a recognizable figure, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=799.82s)]
*  but it's like some green person with nerdy glasses and like spiked black hair circling his face, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=804.62s)]
*  almost like he's in the middle of a black sun hanging over a dystopian city that seems polluted [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=811.26s)]
*  or whatever. Anyway, just since it was hovering on the screen for two minutes, I thought I should [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=818.46s)]
*  note that that too is creepy. That's just the graphic of the Twitter user who found this video [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=822.62s)]
*  and actually did a very good job of summarizing in text form exactly what these bizarre constraints [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=829.58s)]
*  are in RFK. Now Senator Cassidy himself said that these constraints are unprecedented and at the end [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=834.94s)]
*  he said, yeah, RFK Jr. is going to be the HHS secretary, but he's not really going to make [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=844.62s)]
*  decisions on his own. He's going to make them in partnership with us, with me as the chairman of [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=851.02s)]
*  this committee. And apparently there are a lot of people who think that these Means siblings [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=854.6999999999999s)]
*  are kind of grifters, that they really weren't part of this Maha movement until they joined [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=865.5s)]
*  very recently. They don't have any expertise, they have no credentials, they just kind of [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=871.18s)]
*  hopped on the train, made themselves into podcast stars, went on Joe Rogan, did the podcast circuit [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=877.98s)]
*  and then catapulted themselves into these positions. And it's not just Nicole Shanahan, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=884.94s)]
*  I've seen other people who help the experts and vaccine activists who are very supportive of RFK [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=889.66s)]
*  and the Maha movement who were extremely skeptical of this announcement and concerned that it signifies, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=897.1s)]
*  as Nicole Shanahan said, that RFK is not really making the decisions, that instead these decisions [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=904.06s)]
*  are being made for him. And I'm not here to adjudicate that, like I said it was surprising [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=910.4599999999999s)]
*  to me that there was so much negative opinion toward these Means siblings given how much they've [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=916.9399999999999s)]
*  been associated publicly with RFK Jr. and how vocal they've been in advocating for him. But I find the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=923.8199999999999s)]
*  more interesting and really kind of disturbing aspect of all this that, of course Congress should [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=929.34s)]
*  have oversight over the executive branch. I think they've done a terrible job in fact when [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=937.26s)]
*  abdicating that responsibility far too much. But this is not that, as he said, it's unprecedented. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=941.9s)]
*  It's basically saying, I'm going to be your boss and I'm going to not just do oversight of the HHS [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=947.1800000000001s)]
*  department, but you have to go through me. And you'll notice that this all has to pass, anything [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=953.74s)]
*  you do passes the test of the scientific establishment that got so discredited, rightfully [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=958.06s)]
*  so, during COVID. And this goes back to the around segment that we were just talking about as well, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=963.18s)]
*  which is you can elect the president and especially in this honeymoon period right after the president [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=969.5s)]
*  wins, gets inaugurated, people are excited, people are willing to give him a chance. He has a good [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=975.3399999999999s)]
*  amount of power, a lot of political capital to expend. And Trump in particular came in with a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=980.6199999999999s)]
*  plan to limit or punish or target or silence any group or faction that might impede what he wants [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=986.7s)]
*  to do. The law firms that might, the biggest law firms that might litigate against him, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=996.0600000000001s)]
*  he's attacked media, he's attacked universities, but he has also kept the Republicans in Congress [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1003.0200000000001s)]
*  in line because he's still very popular among Republican Party voters. And he has proven many [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1010.14s)]
*  times that he could remove people from the Senate or Congress, not 100%, but certainly put people in [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1018.14s)]
*  jeopardy by condemning them publicly and they're afraid of that and he's kept them in line. But [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1023.26s)]
*  the establishment and authoritarian institutions do not give up power easily. They don't just say [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1030.22s)]
*  oh, someone won the election, is there going to start a agenda? I guess we just have to accept [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1039.1000000000001s)]
*  that. They have a lot of weapons. That's why they're the establishment. And they're not going to go [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1044.7s)]
*  down easy. And you see this now emerging, this kind of old school, warmongering neocons who are [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1049.42s)]
*  trying to impede what Trump clearly is attempting to do in the Middle East and with Iran to force [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1057.1000000000001s)]
*  him to go to war with Iran even though he doesn't want to. And you see it here with RFK having played [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1062.54s)]
*  a role in Trump's victory. And there are a lot of people who voted for Trump because of RFK Jr. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1067.98s)]
*  And that was part of what was ratified electorally was this maha movement. Whatever you think of it, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1074.94s)]
*  it is in many ways divergent from establishment science, mainstream scientists, the health [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1082.78s)]
*  industry, the pharmaceutical industry. That's why a lot of people support it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1088.94s)]
*  That's what was ratified electorally and that you see these people stepping in [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1093.82s)]
*  who are arms of the pharmaceutical industry, the food industry, the health insurance industry, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1097.98s)]
*  working to subvert the election and creating these impediments on people who are put into [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1105.18s)]
*  power because the American people wanted them to be there because they believed in their agenda. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1111.74s)]
*  And that's the most important part of the RFK thing. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOb04sqiWxM&t=1116.54s)]
