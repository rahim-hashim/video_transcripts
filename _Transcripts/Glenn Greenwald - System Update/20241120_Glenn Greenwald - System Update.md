# Post-Election: Glenn Takes Your Questions On The Trump Admin & More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk)
*  Music [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=0.0s)]
*  Good evening everybody. Welcome to the After Show here on Locals. As you know, we never do anything before I first introduce my K9 co-host. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=17.0s)]
*  And today I have Bob B. who is sitting on my lap. Very excited for the show looking just ridiculously adorable. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=25.0s)]
*  And I'm going to try and get the other K9 co-host who is Kuma. Kuma. Kuma. Kuma. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=32.0s)]
*  He was being so...here, here he's coming. And he's here as well doing a little bit of...I don't know if he's easy to see, but there he is doing a little bit of support work. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=39.0s)]
*  I am without my human co-host, my normal human co-host, which is Victor Pujy, because he's on vacation. He's traveling the Amazon actually. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=51.0s)]
*  He'll be back on Monday. And he said he's having a great time. The Amazon is amazingly beautiful, so I'm not surprised. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=60.0s)]
*  So it's kind of like an old school version of the Locals After Show where, as you might remember, I was doing it by myself for quite a long time. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=68.0s)]
*  And so we decided that having me talk for 90 minutes without any interruption on the show sometimes, if I don't have a guest, and then talk for another 30 could be kind of straining both on me and on you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=74.0s)]
*  As much as I love to hear my voice, it is a lot. But Victor will be back on Tuesday, and so we'll get back to that more conversational format. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=85.0s)]
*  So before we get to the questions, I just want to kind of share this thought with you, which is I think people are going a little bit crazy about all of these endorsements, trying to read so...I mean all of these appointments, trying to read so much into them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=93.0s)]
*  And I do think that one of the things people have forgotten is that what Trump's appeal was supposed to be is that he's supposed to be an anti-establishment force inside Washington to go in and kind of subvert and alarm and disrupt the establishment. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=112.0s)]
*  And the first picks, I think, were alarming to a lot of people, not so much because of the ideology of those people, although that was concerning too, but it was more because for all those reasons that I've said, I don't think that the ideology will matter that much. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=127.0s)]
*  It's more that they were just such conventional picks. In fact, I just saw today Mike Pompeo, who was supposed to be one of the people we were supposed to keep out of the Trump administration, saying, oh, I'm so thrilled to hear the choice to be Secretary of State Marco Rubio because he's such an outstanding choice. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=140.0s)]
*  And there are a lot of choices like that in the beginning, and I think maybe that was designed to give comfort to establishment people about what was coming next, people like Matt Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard and today RFK and even Pete Hegseth, who ideologically may be okay to most people, but not in terms of, as we talked about last night, I don't want to go into all that again, but just in terms of the trust that they have. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=158.0s)]
*  That is a very sensitive position running the Pentagon, and mostly it's about running the budget and making sure that the wheels are getting churned. And I don't know if he's trustworthy enough to do that, and I think that's their concern. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=181.0s)]
*  So anyway, it's been a lot. I think it's super interesting what's going on in Washington. Obviously, it's important to continue having people like that appointed who are not conventional appointees. I actually heard from pretty reliable sources today that Thomas Massey, the Congressman from Kentucky, who has been on our show many times, who's one of my favorite people in Congress, is being widely considered for Agriculture Secretary. I wish it's not by any means a done deal. I wish, to be honest, that he would be International Secretary of State. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=193.0s)]
*  He would probably be in a national security or intelligence position, but probably he would not be confirmable because of his extreme adroxy, to put that mildly, on Israel. But I'm not even sure I like him as Agriculture Secretary per se, because he's a libertarian. He believes in a lot fewer regulations, and I think especially when it comes to things like the treatment of animals and industrial agriculture, probably some more supervision is necessary. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=222.0s)]
*  But anything that Thomas Massey does, any responsibility he's given, any authority he earns, is something that I consider to be a good thing, and we'll see how that plays out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=250.0s)]
*  All right, let's work on the, let's answer some of these questions just because we haven't had a normal after show in a while. We did that Jeremy LaFrayto interview. For those of you who haven't watched that LaFrayto interview, I think a couple people in the chat were asking where the link is. It was a great interview. It's incredibly important what happened to him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=260.0s)]
*  It's actually quite harrowing what happened to him. Not even so much because of what happened to him, but because of what it means about what's happening to people who aren't American journalists, who courts don't immediately say release him because he's done nothing wrong. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=278.0s)]
*  What they did to him was bad enough, and you can just imagine what they're doing when nobody's looking. So we're going to put the link into the chat for those of you who haven't been able to see it, but it is on the local's website, and we're going to probably put it on the Rumble show sometime next week. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=290.0s)]
*  All right, here are the questions. The first one is from K Kotwas. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=306.0s)]
*  Kotwas. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=312.0s)]
*  Yeah, that does concern me a little bit. I do think that there is a concern that's very valid just in general, leaving those individual people aside for the moment, that in order to run this time, Donald Trump needed money because he is a very powerful person. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=316.0s)]
*  He needed money because he has been so swamped with criminal proceedings as well as civil litigation. Remember that lawsuit that Letitia James brought against the Trump Organization in New York, which I think is going to be overturned on appeal based on the appellate court hearing, but for now it isn't. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=344.0s)]
*  And so he really had to rely upon very, very wealthy people. Remember Trump's original promise in 2016 was, I don't have to rely on anybody. I don't need funding from anybody. I'm rich enough to fund myself and all these other people here are captive to lobbyists and donors. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=363.0s)]
*  This time Trump relied on the funding of Mary Madelson for $130 million, Elon Musk for another $130 million, Timothy Mellon for I think $180 million, people like Bill Ackman. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=392.0s)]
*  And so those people are going to be looking for things in return in exchange for that money and Trump, if anything, if nothing else, is a businessman. And he understands how that transactional relationship works. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=410.0s)]
*  That does concern me already, although obviously the Democrats have exactly the same sorts of problems. Nonetheless, that's one of the things that Trump boasted about early on. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=422.0s)]
*  Now I do think it's going to be interesting to see whether or not both Trump and Elon Musk can coexist in the same world, given all the attention and the power that Elon Musk wants, the attention that he wants. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=431.0s)]
*  He met today with the Iranian foreign minister to try and smooth over U.S.-Iranian relations. So we'll see how much of that relationship proceeds, but a lot of these people, these donors, paid money like Bill Ackman and Mary Madelson and others to ensure loyalty to Israel. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=443.0s)]
*  And I think if there's one thing you can count on, it's that the Trump administration is going to be extremely pro-Israel. But as I talked last night, we'll see what the impact is. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=460.0s)]
*  I'm not sure that it can be much worse than what the current administration is. As for the individuals involved, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and Mark Andreessen, they do have this very kind of extreme transhumanist, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=470.0s)]
*  technologically dependent version of humanity. Now the only thing I would say is, and I actually had a conversation with a few people today, including a couple who are running for a couple of nominations, is that the reality is that even if, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=489.0s)]
*  I think this is the argument being made for Matt Gaetz, is that the U.S. government is such a gigantic entity that, I remember actually President Obama after a year in office described it using this metaphor, and I always remembered it because I thought it was accurate when he was being pressured or questioned about why he hasn't brought in the kinds of change that he had promised. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=504.0s)]
*  People were very disappointed. He said, look, the U.S. government is like this gigantic naval vessel. It's like massive cruise ship. And you can't just turn the wheel and have it turn around in 90 degrees or 180 degrees in a short period of time. You just have to keep redirecting it, redirecting it slowly. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=527.0s)]
*  And eventually it will start going on a slightly different course and a slightly different course more and more. Now Obama didn't even put it on a slightly different course, but even if Trump and all these people that he's nominated get on top of these agencies, they're going to have so much pushback. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=546.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like the empire strikes back. I mean, we saw that in the first term. There's not going to be this smooth path that Trump gets in and Elon Musk is there and they just want to do all these radical things without having courts and media and finance and, you know, the establishment links of all parties there to push back in all sorts of ways. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=564.0s)]
*  So would I want Mark Andreessen, Peter Thiel, and Elon Musk's vision of the future to be instantly implemented? No, I think there's huge dangers to it and huge concerns, but I don't think the U.S. government is susceptible to that kind of rapid transformation. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=583.0s)]
*  What I think more than anything is that this swamp, this blob, this foreign policy apparatus and this government apparatus has been firmly embedded and entrenched for so many decades. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=597.0s)]
*  And it just kind of ossifies every year that goes by that anything that uproots it and shakes it up and moves it around and makes it uncomfortable, I think that's inherently good. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=611.0s)]
*  I've always viewed that as the primary promise of Trump, the primary value of him. I think we played the video where Jeremy Scahill quoted Seymour Hersh describing Trump as a circuit breaker. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=621.0s)]
*  Somebody just kind of comes in and finally, you know, uproots things and just kind of makes them unhinged and detached from this root that has grown for so many decades, like cutting down these gigantic trees and then finally something else can grow in their place. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=632.0s)]
*  So it's obviously a risky strategy, but I find it hard to perceive, imagine how it could be worse than the bipartisan status quo in Washington. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=651.0s)]
*  As we talked about earlier, health and dealing with stress are something that has always been important to me, especially as I know people in my life and see people in my life all the time who are frequently consumed by all sorts of political realities even that can be stressful or depressing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=661.0s)]
*  It's why I do things like exercise and maintain a healthy diet and it's why, as I've said before, I take CBD to decrease my stress levels and to help me get a good night's sleep. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=683.0s)]
*  But I'm talking with family members and friends and looking into the research. One of the things I learned is that not just humans, but also pets, dogs and the like might benefit from taking CBD as well. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=692.0s)]
*  Dogs are a very central part of my life. We have 26 at home. We have a dog shelter that rescues hundreds of dogs and so obviously dogs are extremely important to me. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=705.0s)]
*  I would never do an ad about a product for dogs that I didn't completely trust and I didn't start using myself. CBD can also help dogs who are particularly stressed out, especially older dogs can benefit from the pain relief it confers, from the help that it gives in terms of sleeping. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=713.0s)]
*  There's a lot of research on that now. That's the reason for our newest sponsor, which is King Canine. I'm very happy about this. I spent a lot of time on the phone talking with this company, looking at the research that supports this product. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=728.0s)]
*  They develop quality CBD alongside special deshedding combs and other animal care products for your free family members, meaning your pets. CBD is proven to decrease inflammation, aid with sleep and decrease seizures, not just among humans, but dogs as well. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=738.0s)]
*  Just so you aren't worried, CBD is a perfectly legal non-hallucinogenic compound that won't get your pets high or loopy. King Canine is a product that I recommend to family members and friends. We've begun using it both on my dogs and at the shelter and it's working very well. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=755.0s)]
*  It's something that I'm very thankful for considering that I have, as I said, a lot of dogs at home and a lot of dogs for which I'm responsible. To get started with all of the great products King Canine has to offer, not just CBD, but a bunch of other products as well. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=769.0s)]
*  It's created by people who are also completely devoted to dogs, people who rescue dogs, who have dog shelters, who have numerous dogs at their house because they're constantly rescuing dogs. It's not just a company that looks to exploit a market opportunity. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=781.0s)]
*  It's people who love dogs as much as anybody. A lot of the conversation I had with them was about exactly that sort of thing. If you want to look at their products, I hope you will definitely consider you can head over to their store for a 10% off discount with the special code GLENN. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=797.0s)]
*  That's G-L-E-N-N at checkout to receive 10% off of all the wonderful products King Canine has to offer. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=812.0s)]
*  Alright, Bonnie, 1947, says, Noam Chomsky in a video discusses the indictable war crimes of several United States presidents, but doesn't say why they weren't held accountable. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=820.0s)]
*  Trump wasn't busted for the murder of General Soleimani, yet people were outraged with the Supreme Court's decision on immunity, but Scott Chomsky seems to be suggesting that there already is de facto immunity, or as you pointed out, a gentleman's agreement. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=836.0s)]
*  So my question is, why will any president ever be held accountable for war crimes? To me, it's a very simple question, which is, the United States government is an extremely powerful government. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=850.0s)]
*  Who's going to come and arrest the former president or the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of State, take them to the Hague, put them on trial unless the United States government wants that to happen? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=863.0s)]
*  In fact, there have been judgments of the international court before, such as when Nicaragua sued the United States, because when the United States government in the 1980s was trying to destabilize Central America, they mined the harbor of Nicaragua. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=875.0s)]
*  And for a long time, commercial ships and just boats were being exploded or being injured, civilians were being killed in large numbers, an incredibly criminal thing to do, to just leave mines and harbors of boats. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=897.0s)]
*  But that was part of the United States effort to destabilize the region, and the international court ruled in favor of the United States against Nicaragua, and the United States just said, we're ignoring the judgment. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=911.0s)]
*  It was a judgment of like $700 million, and the United States said, we don't care, we don't recognize your authority. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=920.0s)]
*  And in fact, there is legislation that the United States has enacted that authorizes the use of military force to invade the Hague in the event that any American official or U.S. soldier is put inside the, is put at the Hague without the permission of the United States government. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=926.0s)]
*  So, you know, Vladimir Putin is standing trial or is charged with war crimes now in the South African government when he wanted to go there for the BRICS conference, said, look, we're a small government, we can't be the United States, we have to actually abide by international conventions. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=944.0s)]
*  And if you come here, we would have to arrest you. So they told him in advance he obviously wasn't going to come. He appeared by video. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=959.0s)]
*  And in Brazil, too, the BRICS or the G20 is scheduled for this year, and normally Putin would go and Brazilian President Lula da Silva, when asked at first, of course, we're going to allow Putin to come. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=965.0s)]
*  And it created this major diplomatic uproar, including with the United States, because there's an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=979.0s)]
*  And then we'll have to kind of backtrack and say, we'll think about it or we'll abide by the law. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=987.0s)]
*  So it's just a question of power. I mean, you can indict President Xi or other Chinese officials if you want for war crimes. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=992.0s)]
*  It's the reason you see only weak or defeated powers at the Hague, you know, African warlords or, you know, serving leaders after the United States and NATO won that war. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1000.0s)]
*  But you never see American officials there. As for immunity, you know, I did a whole show on this. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1010.0s)]
*  I think I'm scheduled to debate this at some point in New York. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1017.0s)]
*  The question of whether, yeah, in early December, I'm supposed to debate this question of immunity because it's so interesting because when I began writing about politics and had concluded that a lot of war and terror policies were criminal, illegal, eavesdropping and violation of FISA, torture, rendition, especially though illegally eavesdropping because that was a domestic crime. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1020.0s)]
*  And argued that those should be prosecuted Bush and Cheney and top officials. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1045.0s)]
*  I wrote a book about that. And then when Obama got into office, despite promising during the campaign to consider the possibility that Bush Cheney officials or CIA officials would be prosecuted for things like torture, he immediately got into office and said, we're going to give immunity to everybody in the Bush administration, including the CIA, because it's important that we not look backward but only forward. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1050.0s)]
*  I was so amazed by that justification because all criminal prosecutions by their nature look backward. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1073.0s)]
*  The whole point is somebody did something in the past that's criminal and now you're prosecuting and punishing them for it to uphold the law and deter future violations. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1081.0s)]
*  And so if you adopt this mentality for elites that, oh, we can't look backward. We have to look forward. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1088.0s)]
*  You're essentially immunizing them from the rule of law. And there was a consensus that Obama did the right thing in the United States. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1095.0s)]
*  And then even with the financial crisis of 2008, when none of those people caused the financial crisis were prosecuted, the same kind of rationale was invoked, which was, oh, we have to get the economy back on track. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1102.0s)]
*  And if we prosecute these hedge funds or Wall Street Journal, these Wall Street banks, it will prevent us from looking forward and making progress. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1114.0s)]
*  That same rationale was used now that we don't only have immunity from political officials, but also for financial officials. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1123.0s)]
*  And so when I got into politics, it was in large part a response to this idea that the executive branch was so powerful, the president was so powerful that he was immune from the dictates of law. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1131.0s)]
*  And so to watch the people in the Bush administration now take the lead in pretending they oppose an imperial presidency is sickening enough. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1141.0s)]
*  But when I looked at that Supreme Court ruling that essentially said American presidents can't be prosecuted for things they do in office that are part of their official duties. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1149.0s)]
*  It would to me, that's already the effect of law. It's kind of like how if the US now recognizes the West Bank is being annexed by Israel. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1158.0s)]
*  You know, in a way you can say, well, that decision is bad and wrong, but it's already the reality. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1169.0s)]
*  The Israelis already control the West Bank. And it's better on some level just to have that stated. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1174.0s)]
*  And so that immunity decision has been building in courts for a long time, but it's also been building in American tradition and custom. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1180.0s)]
*  And that's why I found all that hysteria over, oh, my God, Donald Trump is now above the law to be so unhinged. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1186.0s)]
*  And so many people who have been saying that have been work for many years to construct these theories of executive power that justified that. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1193.0s)]
*  All right, let's go to the next question. Oh, here. This is from Somni 451. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1201.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is a great question. It's not just her. It's so many of these appointees who have said we should deport these people protesting Israel. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1223.0s)]
*  There was just a bill that we were going to cover. We haven't gotten into this week, though, that gave the president the unilateral authority to decree that some nonprofit NGO inside the United States. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1235.0s)]
*  Was promoting or supporting terrorism. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1250.0s)]
*  And based on that unchallenged, you know, out of ruling would have the right to. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1255.0s)]
*  Cancel the nonprofit status of an NGO, which, of course, is crucial to the existence of an NGO, because people who donate to you get get. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1262.0s)]
*  Get tax credit and you don't have to pay taxes. So it's the only way NGOs can exist. If you take away their nonprofit status, it basically will destroy their ability to exist. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1270.0s)]
*  The whole point of the law was very clear. It was to finally let the government find a way another way to destroy organizations that are pro Palestinian in nature and critical of the United States. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1281.0s)]
*  It really is true that throughout the West there has been and continues to be, especially now, an attempt to try and find ways to criminalize opposition to Israel protesting of Israel support for the Palestinian cause. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1291.0s)]
*  And this bill. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1304.0s)]
*  Was voted for. Yes, by every single Republican member of the House, except Thomas Massey, who voted no. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1306.0s)]
*  And it was supported by 52 Democrats, almost all of whom are a pack Democrats like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and just all. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1314.0s)]
*  Richie Torres, all these people who are obsessed with Israel voted yes, because the purpose of this legislation is to destroy pro Palestinian free free speech. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1323.0s)]
*  And obviously that's been something we've been covering for more than a year now. This kind of attempt on the right that has been waving the banner of free speech, the pro Israel right to suddenly start justifying all kinds of censorship on the grounds that anyone who criticizes Israel or is pro Palestinian is actually a terrorist. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1333.0s)]
*  And therefore they don't have the right of free speech. So that's going to be something that's going to require a lot of vigilance. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1352.0s)]
*  This bill didn't pass, but believe me, it's going to come up again and it will pass because Israel never loses in the US Congress. People are petrified of opposing it. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1358.0s)]
*  And what's so amazing to me about it is that these 52 Democrats who it also includes people who are leaving Congress like Colin Alred, who just lost to Ted Cruz. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1368.0s)]
*  It includes the people who voted yes, Adam Schiff, who just got elected to the Senate in California and Alyssa Slotkin who just got elected to the Senate in Michigan who are now moving up from the House to the Senate. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1378.0s)]
*  These are Democrats who voted yes, obviously eight pack loyal Democrats. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1393.0s)]
*  This is going to come back and there's going to be a lot of a lot of efforts like this to criminalize not just speech but also activism against Israel and for Palestine. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1398.0s)]
*  And I think that's going to have to be really vigilantly watched. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1413.0s)]
*  All right. Last question comes from Hakoon. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1415.0s)]
*  I believe most were unaware that the Senate chose their majority leader through secret ballot. Has it always been this way? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1418.0s)]
*  Why is the majority leader election happening so quickly? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1424.0s)]
*  So it's a good question. Basically the whole idea of our Constitution in our form of government, which is a good idea, but it has been really abandoned, is that the way that you prevent too much concentration of power in any one branch is that each branch of government is supposed to be very aggressive in defending their prerogatives, their powers. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1427.0s)]
*  And that's what's so frustrating about the fact that Congress basically wants to give up their power to vote on wars. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1449.0s)]
*  They want to just let the president have that power because it's politically difficult to vote yes or no on wars. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1458.0s)]
*  And they've given that power up, which is supposed to be a crucial power that we will only go to war if our members of Congress who are closest to us, the ones in the House, voted yes. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1464.0s)]
*  The Senate tends to be a little bit more protective of their traditions. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1474.0s)]
*  It's all part of this pompous Senate that they have these traditions that go on for centuries. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1481.0s)]
*  And the idea of choosing the secret ballot and picking the majority leader is the way to insulate themselves from pressure. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1487.0s)]
*  In other words, we choose our own Senate leader. We don't have anyone from the outside pressure us. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1494.0s)]
*  We don't have to vote publicly, so there's no campaigning. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1499.0s)]
*  It's just our Republican caucus and we get to decide who the Senate leader is. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1504.0s)]
*  And they chose John Thune despite the fact that he is extremely pro-establishment. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1510.0s)]
*  The Trump camp really wanted Rick Scott because they know John Thune hates Trump, just like John Cornyn does. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1515.0s)]
*  But the Senate, the Republican senators are very pro-establishment and anti-Trump. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1521.0s)]
*  They obviously aren't going to say that, but they're going to either do things like reject maybe Tulsi, definitely Matt Gaetz, unless they get all sorts of guarantees and return about things they want. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1525.0s)]
*  They are, the Republican establishment, one of the worst and most formidable forces locking in and preventing Trump from doing anything that they would consider destabilizing to the establishment. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1536.0s)]
*  That's why I say there's so many different ways that they're going to do it. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1546.0s)]
*  That's why I say there's so many different safeguards that establishment institutions have against anybody, even the president, who seeks to undermine them or weaken them that it's not going to be very easy at all, even in this first year based on this mandate for Trump to do a lot of things that he wants. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1550.0s)]
*  Just the last question was Tom Beal from Night 94 who says, I'm a viewer from Britain. I wanted to hear your thoughts on Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the UK from 2015 to 2020. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1572.0s)]
*  I've actually been meaning to do a show on Jeremy Corbyn, especially the scare campaign that was done to try and falsely malign him as anti-Semitic. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1584.0s)]
*  I know there are a lot of people in the United States who believe that he was, who thinks he's some kind of communist. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1592.0s)]
*  I actually thought that Jeremy Corbyn's potential election as prime minister would be one of the best developments that I could think of in part because he is like a Trump to me in the sense that he's an anti-establishment figure and I want to see more of those kinds of people. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1597.0s)]
*  Obviously there's ideological differences between Corbyn and Trump, but they very much kind of provoke similar establishment reactions. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1613.0s)]
*  I'll do a whole show on Corbyn. I think the difference between Trump and Corbyn is that Trump never ever sought to apologize or to appease unfair accusations. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1619.0s)]
*  He was just very shameless and ignoring them or rejecting them, whereas Corbyn was always very weak, giving credence to false accusations, including this anti-Semitism claim in the Labour Party. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1631.0s)]
*  As a result, he got weaker and weaker, gave credence to these accusations. You can't appease people like that. They just have much different personality types. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1642.0s)]
*  We'll definitely do a whole show on Corbyn. I thought it was really interesting when we had Darren Beatty on to talk about Imran Khan and he drew all these parallels between what happened to Imran Khan and what happened to Trump. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1650.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of parallels like that with Jeremy Corbyn. I want to make sure that people who hear Jeremy Corbyn and think they know who he is hear the real story of who he is. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1663.0s)]
*  I think we'll talk differently about it. I always want to take the opportunity to thank you for being members here, for participating here. It's more important than we can tell you and we really appreciate it. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1672.0s)]
*  Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you back on the main show tomorrow night at 7 and then next week at our regular times as well. Have a great evening. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1683.0s)]
*  We'll see you then. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHXesVXtydk&t=1702.0s)]
