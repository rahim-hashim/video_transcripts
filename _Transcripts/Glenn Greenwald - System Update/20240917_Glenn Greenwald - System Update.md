# Second Trump Assassination Attempt Tied to Pro-Ukraine Extremism?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo)
*  Now, this idea of foreign fighters going to Ukraine was first raised by President Zelensky [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=0.0s)]
*  in the early part of the war back in February of 2022. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  There you see it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=16.48s)]
*  Ukraine appeals for foreign volunteers to join fight against Russia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=17.48s)]
*  President Zelensky issued calls to arms to foreign nationals in the battle against, quote, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Russian war criminals. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=25.8s)]
*  Now on some level, I have to say the people who insisted that this war was some sort of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=30.04s)]
*  existential threat to the United States, that it was the great cause of our lifetime, I [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=34.04s)]
*  almost respect the people more who actually answered President Zelensky's calls where [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=38.56s)]
*  he was saying, like, if you're like a fighting capability, if you're a fighting age and you're [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=43.84s)]
*  saying you support the Ukrainian cause, putting our flags in your bioware, get off the line. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=50.64s)]
*  Come and help us fight the Russian army. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=55.72s)]
*  You can see he knew that this massive size difference between the two countries by itself [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=58.8s)]
*  would ensure that eventually Ukraine would lose. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=62.6s)]
*  And so few people answered that call, preferring instead to make themselves so strong and tough [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=66.36s)]
*  and powerful, writing more and more columns about how we have to send more and more Ukrainians, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=71.24s)]
*  including ones increasingly unwilling to fight to go die in that war. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=76.0s)]
*  But at least this assassin or would-be assassin, along with people like Malcolm Nance, actually [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=78.84s)]
*  followed that insanity to its ultimate conclusion by actually going to Ukraine and doing what [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=85.44s)]
*  Zelensky said, but very few did. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Here is the original article that focused on people like Ryan Routh and Malcolm Nance [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=94.0s)]
*  and some of these utterly crazy people who went to Ukraine, started wildly exaggerating [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=99.72s)]
*  their credentials and what they were doing there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=106.72s)]
*  This is from March of 2023. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  A quote, stolen valor, the US volunteers in Ukraine who lie waste and bicker. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=111.8s)]
*  Quote, people who would not be allowed anywhere near the battlefield in the US led war are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=116.36s)]
*  active on the Ukrainian front with ready weapons to act to American weapon, ready access to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=121.84s)]
*  American weapons. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Quote, they rushed to Ukraine by the thousands, many of them Americans who promised to bring [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  military experience, money or supplies to the battleground of a righteous war. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=131.92s)]
*  Hometown newspapers hailed their commitment and donors backed them with millions of dollars. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=136.32s)]
*  Now after a year of combat, many of these homespun groups of volunteers are fighting [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  with themselves and undermining the war effort. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=145.64s)]
*  Some have wasted money or stolen valor. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=148.64s)]
*  Others have cloaked themselves in charity while also trying to profit off the war record [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=151.0s)]
*  show. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=154.72s)]
*  One retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel from Virginia is the focus of a US federal investigation [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=156.64s)]
*  into the potentially illegal export of military technology. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=160.82s)]
*  A former Army soldier arrived in Ukraine only to turn traitor and defect to Russia. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=165.44s)]
*  A Connecticut man who lied about his military service has posted live updates from the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=170.48s)]
*  battlefield including his exact location and boasted about his easy access to American weapons. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  A former construction worker is hatching a plan to use fake passports to smuggle in fighters [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=181.28s)]
*  from Pakistan and Iran. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=185.56s)]
*  And then here's where this article from 2023 talks about this suspected assassin. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=188.16s)]
*  Quote, Ryan Routh, a former construction worker from Greensboro, North Carolina, is seeking [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  recruits from among Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=197.12s)]
*  Mr. Routh, who spent several months in Ukraine last year, said he planned to move them, in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=200.96s)]
*  some cases illegally, from Pakistan and Iran to Ukraine. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=204.52s)]
*  He said dozens of these trained Afghan fighters, trained by the US, had expressed interest. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=208.6s)]
*  Quote, we could probably purchase some passports through Pakistan since it's such a corrupt [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=212.68s)]
*  country, he said in an interview from Washington. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=216.88s)]
*  It is not clear whether he has succeeded, but one former Afghan soldier said he had [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=218.88s)]
*  been contacted and was interested in fighting it, but meant leaving Iran where he was living [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=222.92s)]
*  illegally. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=227.64s)]
*  Malcolm Nance, who admits that he knows of Ryan Routh from Ukraine, a former Navy cryptologist [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=230.28s)]
*  and MSNBC commentator, arrived in Ukraine last year and made a plan to bring order and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=238.11999999999998s)]
*  discipline to the Legion. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=243.0s)]
*  Instead, he became enmeshed in the chaos. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  Today, Mr. Nance is involved in a messy, distracting power struggle. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  He accused a pro-Ukraine fundraising group of fraud, providing no evidence. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=251.0s)]
*  After arguing with two Legion administrators, Mr. Nance wrote a quote, counterintelligence [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=254.88s)]
*  report trying to get them fired. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=258.64s)]
*  Central to that report is an accusation that one Legion official, Amis Abigail Fike, fraudulently [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  tried to buy a house on an Australian reality TV show with money she said she didn't have. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  He labeled her, quote, a potential Russian spy, offering no evidence. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  His fake denied the accusations, remains with the Legion. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=279.44s)]
*  Mr. Nance has left Ukraine but continues fundraising with a new group of allies. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=281.44s)]
*  Malcolm Nance is an insane person. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=287.64s)]
*  I think he basically got excluded from MSNBC so except Joy Reads. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=289.28s)]
*  I can't tell you how many times I've been called a Russian agent by Malcolm Nance. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=295.64s)]
*  He just states explicitly, oh, he's a paid agent of the Kremlin. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=299.36s)]
*  He says that pretty much about everybody. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  But this is the circle that attracted people to the war in Ukraine. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=307.96s)]
*  They created so much melodrama. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=312.88s)]
*  In fact, we've had in our possession for several months a lot of these documents about Malcolm [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=314.24s)]
*  Nance, by Malcolm Nance, revealing just some of the insanity around these American would-be [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  fighters who went there claiming they were going to organize an international Legion [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=324.52s)]
*  of fighters. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=328.2s)]
*  We just basically haven't reported on it because he's not significant enough. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=329.2s)]
*  But in light of his connection to this, Trump assassin, would-be Trump assassin, in light [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  of the kind of importance of understanding what this war is producing and what impact [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=336.88s)]
*  it will have once the conflict ends for wherever they go, as we've just seen, I think it's [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=343.56s)]
*  worth doing that reporting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=349.44s)]
*  So now we're going to hear from a video about the Azov Battalion, which you probably remember [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=350.44s)]
*  was formally classified as a neo-Nazi hate group until history needed to be revised and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=356.52s)]
*  rewritten in order to support the Azov Battalion. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=363.04s)]
*  I mean, they were, for example, banned from... [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  You could not praise the Azov Battalion on Facebook prior to February 2022 or you would [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  be banned. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=373.16s)]
*  There were US laws in place prohibiting any weapons, American weapons, from reaching the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=374.16s)]
*  Azov Battalion because the Western consensus was that they were an actual Nazi group, that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=379.6s)]
*  their allegiance was to various SS leaders and Ukrainian neo-Nazis who collaborated with [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=384.88s)]
*  Hitler during World War II. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=389.92s)]
*  They used Nazi insignia and they were the most prominent battalion in Ukraine. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=391.76s)]
*  And because Putin said one of the purposes of the war was to denazify Ukraine, remember [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=398.64s)]
*  Russian history is steeped in the evils of Nazism. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  They lost tens of millions of people in order to defeat Nazi Germany during World War II. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=406.24s)]
*  The Germans invaded Russia through Ukraine, which is why that part of the border is so [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=410.8s)]
*  sensitive. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=416.44s)]
*  Overnight, this history got rewritten. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=418.96s)]
*  You no longer were calling the Azov Battalion neo-Nazi. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=420.76s)]
*  In fact, they started just to be called nationalists. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=423.32s)]
*  And then eventually there were many media articles just depicting them as heroic, these [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=425.48s)]
*  heroic defenders of Ukrainian sovereignty from the Azov Battalion. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=430.32s)]
*  Just look at the power propaganda. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=434.4s)]
*  They can take a group for 10 years and formally classify them as a neo-Nazi hate group. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=436.68s)]
*  And then overnight, when they want to arm that group and rely on them to fight for the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=442.64s)]
*  United States, the entire narrative reverses instantly overnight to the point where we [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=447.48s)]
*  now venerate the heroic, courageous fighters of the Azov Battalion. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=454.04s)]
*  Anyway, here is a video from May of 2022, just three months after the war began. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=459.8s)]
*  So I don't think the Azov Battalion had time to do any of its reforms, even if they had [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=464.64s)]
*  done them, certainly not by May of 2022. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=470.92s)]
*  Remember, four months earlier in January of 2022, the entire consensus of the West was [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=472.72s)]
*  that this was a neo-Nazi group. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=476.8s)]
*  And here's a video about the Azov Battalion in which you'll never guess who appears. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  Ryan Roof, the alleged attempted assassin of Donald Trump. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=483.8s)]
*  We are military men who are now in the city of Maripol. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=491.68s)]
*  We appeal to our president. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=494.68s)]
*  Please, Vladimir Zelensky, officially address the US representatives and put our wounded, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  the military garrison on the lists and take away the bodies of the dead soldiers. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  All the families and all of Ukraine are asking you to do this. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=511.6s)]
*  I am Azov, I am Maripol, I am Ukraine. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=516.32s)]
*  Sorry, it's really hard, but the purpose of the action is to appeal to both leaders. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=519.84s)]
*  Now there you see at the rally, pretty small rally, Ryan Roof, who went to an Azov rally [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=528.76s)]
*  wearing his American uniform. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=537.84s)]
*  And there's some conflict that this was presented as and appeared to be a video produced by [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=540.0s)]
*  the Azov Battalion. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=546.76s)]
*  Some Ukraine supporters online are claiming that Azov didn't produce this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=548.08s)]
*  It was just about Azov. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=552.16s)]
*  It was open to anybody. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=553.48s)]
*  But nonetheless, you can just see the extremism from the start of aligning with the most extremist [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=554.4s)]
*  groups in Ukraine, which are pretty much the only real fighters at this point. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=560.4s)]
*  We have interviewed many times the American-Ukrainian journalist Lev Kolonkin. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=566.04s)]
*  And back in June of 2023, writing in The Nation, he documented, quote, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  The Western media is whitewashing the Azov battalion. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=575.88s)]
*  Before Russia invaded Ukraine, these fighters were neo-Nazis. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  They still are. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  And he's a Ukrainian Jewish writer, so he's particularly sensitive to the presence of [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=584.0s)]
*  Nazi battalions inside Ukraine for obvious reasons. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=589.16s)]
*  And he wrote, quote, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=591.84s)]
*  In November of 2014, Kiev sought to gain control of the Azov battalion by absorbing it into [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=592.64s)]
*  the government. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=597.6s)]
*  Azov became a regiment in Ukraine's National Guard, which made it a potential direct recipient [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=598.6s)]
*  of American aid. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=603.28s)]
*  The prospect of organized white fanatics being aided by the U.S. quickly came to the attention [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=604.48s)]
*  of Congress, where lawmakers attempted to ban the Pentagon from working with Azov, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=610.0s)]
*  though they were ultimately unsuccessful. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=614.88s)]
*  Later in 2018, a ban on U.S. military aid to the Azov regiment did pass. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=616.8s)]
*  The media also ramped up scrutiny, quote, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=622.24s)]
*  Volunteer Ukrainian unit includes Nazis, U.S. Today reported in March 2015. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=624.0s)]
*  The Daily Beast followed with a piece titled, quote, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=628.96s)]
*  How many neo-Nazis at the U.S. backing in Ukraine? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=632.08s)]
*  By 2021, the Azov movement's position as a premier hub of transnational white supremacy [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=634.7199999999999s)]
*  was firmly established. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=640.56s)]
*  It was tracked by researchers as fighters were banned from receiving military aid by [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=642.2399999999999s)]
*  Congress and it was kicked off Facebook. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  The State Department declared its political wing a, quote, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=648.28s)]
*  Nationalistic hate group. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=650.3599999999999s)]
*  But by 2023, February 2023, right when the war began, the Guardian was assuring its readers [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=651.76s)]
*  that, quote, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  are now leading the defense of Maripol, insisting they have shed their previous dubious politics [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=660.76s)]
*  and are rapidly becoming Ukrainian heroes. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=666.52s)]
*  The campaign believed to have recruited British far-right activists was now a thing of the past. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=671.48s)]
*  The BBC began to assert that although, quote, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=676.0400000000001s)]
*  to Russia they are neo-Nazis and their origins lie in a neo-Nazi group, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=678.0400000000001s)]
*  the Azov regiment was being, quote, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=682.84s)]
*  falsely portrayed as Nazi by Moscow. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=684.52s)]
*  Again, these were the same newspapers that for a decade, from a liberal perspective, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=686.84s)]
*  were warning about the neo-Nazi Azov battalion and then overnight they just rewrote history. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=692.76s)]
*  And said, no, no, this group, even though in every one of those videos, including the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=698.76s)]
*  one I showed you, you can see neo-Nazi insignia decorating the uniforms and the flags and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=702.44s)]
*  banners of the Azov group, it just, it, it, it's, that really shocked me how easily and [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=708.2800000000001s)]
*  blatantly they can just rewrite history on a dime when their support for a war requires [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=715.24s)]
*  them to do so. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=721.56s)]
*  It's just, it's, sometimes, no matter how much you think about propaganda and how intense [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=722.52s)]
*  it is in corporate media in the United States and in the West more broadly, when you see [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=727.4s)]
*  those kind of things, it still remains stunning. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=730.68s)]
*  Early in the war, Facebook actually lifted its formal ban on the Azov group, said it's [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=735.4s)]
*  no longer a hate group, and then the United States government followed suit from the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  Washington Post in June of 2024, quote, the U.S. lifts weapons ban on Ukrainian military [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=744.2800000000001s)]
*  unit, quote, the decision was made following a State Department review of the Azov brigade, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  a one-time militia now part of Ukraine's National Guard. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=754.6800000000001s)]
*  So I want to talk a little bit about how this attempted assassination and this person's [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=760.36s)]
*  politics who tried to murder Trump are being depicted and discussed by the parts of the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=768.52s)]
*  media that are primarily devoted to sabotaging Donald Trump, his campaign in 2016, his presidency [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=775.56s)]
*  from 2017 to 2021, and now his second, his third campaign for president. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=783.4s)]
*  But I just want to emphasize that this country that we're involved in, this war that we are [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=788.84s)]
*  heavily, intricately connected to going on its fourth full year is one that is corrupting and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=797.48s)]
*  radicalizing so many people, not just in Ukraine but throughout the West, and that's the reason why [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=807.88s)]
*  people are willing to do something almost as insane as trying to murder Trump on his golf course, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=814.76s)]
*  which is provide long-range missiles to Ukraine, encourage them to use them to strike deep inside [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=819.24s)]
*  Russia even though, as the Russian government has pointed out, NATO involvement is required for those [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=827.96s)]
*  attacks and will make the West a direct belligerent in a conflict with Russia, something that during [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=831.5600000000001s)]
*  the Cold War we were obsessed with avoiding and were able to do. And then you add to that all the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=837.08s)]
*  things that are put into our discourse constantly about who anyone questions the war in Ukraine is [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=843.64s)]
*  a Russian agent. That was the main theme of the debate when David Moore repeatedly harassed Trump [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=848.84s)]
*  to say, I'm cheering for Ukraine to win and implied strongly as to Kamala Harris that he's a Russian agent. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=855.0s)]
*  And this kind of thing put into the atmosphere is along with things like Donald Trump and his movement [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=862.52s)]
*  are not just an ideological adversary but instead are some kind of existential threat. They're going [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=869.24s)]
*  to impose a dictatorship. They're going to, a white nationalist dictatorship. They're going to end [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=873.72s)]
*  American democracy. Of course, when you link that to especially the cause of Ukraine, which has been [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=878.6s)]
*  the number one political priority of Washington for the last three years, is going to produce all [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=885.0s)]
*  sorts of violence and all sorts of instability. So if you're somebody who in the past has argued [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=891.16s)]
*  that people who espouse extremist rhetoric are responsible for those who hear it and then commit [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=896.9200000000001s)]
*  violence in the name, a theory that I've often rejected and still do, but if you're somebody [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=901.24s)]
*  who has insisted upon this, there's absolutely no question that all that democratic party and [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=905.56s)]
*  liberal rhetoric repeated and echoed perfectly by this attempted assassin of Donald Trump [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=913.4799999999999s)]
*  clearly was a major part of what formed his thinking and his worldview and his political motives, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=920.76s)]
*  enough to first get him to go to Ukraine and then wait on a golf course where Donald Trump was [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp7HIBWIlo&t=925.9599999999999s)]
