# Americaâ€™s Most-Wanted Activist Exposes Factory Farms
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo)
*  Wayne, thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's always great to see you and we're glad you were able to come. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=10.0s)]
*  It's my pleasure to be here, go on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=14.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=17.0s)]
*  So I've been following your work and reporting on your work for quite a long time and have [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=18.0s)]
*  been a vocal admirer of what you're doing, even though on a personal level, as I've told [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=21.72s)]
*  you before, I wish you didn't subject yourself to quite as much jail time as you do, but [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=27.02s)]
*  we'll get to that in a second. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=32.46s)]
*  And when I first began reporting on you, I know you've moved on since then and we're [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=33.46s)]
*  going to talk about that too, but you are with the animal rights group, activist group [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=37.34s)]
*  called Direct Action Everywhere, DXE. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=41.54s)]
*  What was the general idea and the ideology behind that group? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=44.96s)]
*  Glenn, starting in 2010, there were these laws called Ag-Gag laws passed across the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  country that made it a crime to merely take photographs inside factory farms, even for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=55.94s)]
*  employees. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=60.62s)]
*  And so a lot of the traditional nonprofit groups were just leaving states where these laws [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=61.62s)]
*  are being passed and we felt like the public had a right to know what was happening inside [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=65.86s)]
*  these factory farms. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=69.58s)]
*  So we started DXE with the idea that we needed to show the world what's actually unfolding [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=70.58s)]
*  in factory farms and slaughterhouses and try to give help to animals who are being criminally [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=75.74s)]
*  abused. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=79.86s)]
*  I think the concept of Ag-Gag laws, maybe people have heard the term before, but it's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=81.58s)]
*  such a profound violation of basic free speech and press freedoms. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=88.1s)]
*  And in fact, many courts have ultimately ruled that to be the case that I think it's kind [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=93.26s)]
*  of shocking to people when they hear what Ag-Gag laws really said. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=96.86s)]
*  It's shocking to learn that that was allowed in the United States. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=102.42s)]
*  So talk a little bit more about exactly what Ag-Gag laws are and were and what they were [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=104.66s)]
*  designed to accomplish. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=111.06s)]
*  The Ag-Gag laws come in a lot of different varieties, but the general thrust of all of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=115.22s)]
*  these varieties is they criminalize the act of publicizing animal cruelty inside a place [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=120.82s)]
*  of institutionalized animal abuse. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=127.38s)]
*  So for example, my friend Amy Meyer was standing on a public street and saw that there was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=128.98s)]
*  a cow being dragged around by a forklift at a slaughterhouse in Utah, which is not just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=133.94s)]
*  cruel to the animal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  It's actually a threat to public health because if you have diseased animals being dragged [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  into the slaughterhouse, that's not good for the human consumer. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=142.33999999999997s)]
*  And all she did was pull out her camera and started videotaping what she was seeing from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  a public sidewalk and she was charged under the Utah Ag-Gag law. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=149.78s)]
*  So as I said, it's a constitutional fraud, but it hasn't stopped the industry from passing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=153.33999999999997s)]
*  them in states across the nation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=157.22s)]
*  Unfortunately, both Democratic and Republican elected officials have been pretty supportive [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=159.82s)]
*  of that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=163.98s)]
*  And our goal was to go into the states where these Ag-Gag laws are being passed, challenge [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  them and face criminal charges if we had to. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's interesting. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=172.14s)]
*  I mean, as somebody who has covered the war on terror for a long time and just general [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=173.66s)]
*  endless war, one of the things that governments need to do to keep a population, if not supportive [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=178.06s)]
*  at least tolerant of very severe forms of barbarism and violence is hide the results [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=184.7s)]
*  of that policy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=192.5s)]
*  So you barely ever see or hear from victims of American wars. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=193.5s)]
*  It's kind of invisible and it's abstract. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=197.94s)]
*  And that is what the agricultural industry has done as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  They don't want people knowing the reality of what's taking place inside these industrialized [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=203.89999999999998s)]
*  factory farms. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  So they've used their control over state legislatures in order to make them make it illegal for people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=209.9s)]
*  to show them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=216.06s)]
*  And so one of the tactics that you have worked on for a long time is something called open [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=217.06s)]
*  rescue, which is really designed to combat the secrecy surrounding these laws. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=223.38s)]
*  I've seen you do it before. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=230.02s)]
*  I've reported on actions where you've done it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=231.02s)]
*  Talk about what open rescue is and what it's intended to accomplish. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=233.38s)]
*  The idea behind open rescue is that if people actually saw what was happening inside these [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=238.86s)]
*  factory farms and slaughterhouses, they'd want to do the common sense thing, which is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=244.10000000000002s)]
*  help the animals that are suffering. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=248.22000000000003s)]
*  So for example, in egg farms, it is common that 10, 15, 20 percent of animals are dying [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  every single year because of the close confinement in these facilities. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=255.94000000000003s)]
*  You have a three pound animal who's shoved into a shed with 200,000 other animals, each [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=259.1s)]
*  of whom is given about one square foot of space, one square foot of space. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=264.7s)]
*  So living your entire life on a sheet of paper and inevitably you're going to have not just [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=268.5s)]
*  hundreds, not just thousands, but tens of thousands of animals trapping each other, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=272.42s)]
*  getting sick and sometimes even eating each other alive. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=276.38s)]
*  And this is often a straight violation of law. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=279.22s)]
*  So in California, that sort of intensive confinement in theory was banned by California voters. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=281.38s)]
*  Eight million voters said, we don't want animals confined in this way. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=285.9s)]
*  This is cruel. It's disgusting. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=289.02s)]
*  It's a big crime. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=290.7s)]
*  And so what we've done is we've gone in these places where we know based on whistleblower [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=292.06s)]
*  accounts, based on sometimes the government's own inspection records that these laws are [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=297.34s)]
*  being broken. We disclose everything about what we're doing openly and we try to give [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=300.85999999999996s)]
*  help to the animals. And over the last few years, we've rescued hundreds of animals from [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  conditions like this, pointing out the violations of law admitted by the industry. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=310.14s)]
*  But unfortunately, in many states, instead of holding some of these corporations accountable [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=314.94s)]
*  and even looking at our evidence, which has been supported by law professors, former [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=319.58s)]
*  prosecutors have all said their findings are accurate. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=323.9s)]
*  What's happening here is a violation of law. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=326.78s)]
*  The government has come after us and I'm actually lucky to be here because I just a few [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=328.38s)]
*  weeks ago, I was in a jail as a result of one of these open rescues where we took a sick [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=332.58s)]
*  chicken to the vet. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=337.5s)]
*  So one of the things that's striking and everything you just said is that and again, I've [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=338.62s)]
*  reported on and have seen open rescues carried out by you and your group. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=342.78s)]
*  And it doesn't involve violence. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=346.94s)]
*  It doesn't involve placing bombs at factory farms. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=349.1s)]
*  It doesn't involve attacking physically the people who work there, security guards. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=352.66s)]
*  It really is a nonviolent, a peaceful way of protesting to sort of rescue two out of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=357.06s)]
*  thousands of small pigs who are close to death or birds are close to death to show people [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=364.86s)]
*  the reality of these animals. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=370.78000000000003s)]
*  And yet you have often faced and continue to face the very real prospect of being [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=372.66s)]
*  prosecuted under felony laws. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=378.98s)]
*  There are even ways to call animal rights activists who don't use violence terrorists. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  You currently have a pending case and have had them pretty much ever since I've known [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=385.98s)]
*  you. And before we get into the specifics of the legalism, what I'd like to ask you is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=390.38s)]
*  why is this cause sufficiently important to you that you are continuously willing to risk [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=395.38s)]
*  your own liberty and constantly involved in fights against the government in order to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=400.94s)]
*  pursue this cause? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=405.7s)]
*  I think it's a combination of two things. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=406.82s)]
*  One is, obviously there's always a personal element. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=407.82s)]
*  And like a lot of Americans, my dog growing up was my best friend. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=410.06s)]
*  And I had an early childhood experience where I saw a dog being killed for food in China. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=414.26s)]
*  The dog looked exactly like my dog back at home. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=420.42s)]
*  And it opened my eyes to the fact that there are animals just like the dogs and cats we [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=422.82s)]
*  live at home, suffering not just violence, but brutal torture for years before they're [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=426.94s)]
*  killed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=431.82s)]
*  But the second thing is, I just think there's an incredible opportunity. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=432.46s)]
*  When Americans actually see what's happening inside these factory farms and slaughterhouses, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=435.7s)]
*  repeatedly, it's been proven time and time again, they want change. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=440.29999999999995s)]
*  When the confines of animals went to voters in California in 2008 for the first time, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=444.65999999999997s)]
*  there were more voters, 8.1 million California voters who voted to free animals from these [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=450.05999999999995s)]
*  cages and had voted for any ballot initiative in California history. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=454.46s)]
*  The big problem is the industry has an enormous amount of voters. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=457.9s)]
*  The big problem is the industry has enormous influence, even in states like California, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=460.94s)]
*  which is a democratic state. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=464.38s)]
*  These laws are very rarely enforced. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=466.02000000000004s)]
*  And when you point out they're not being enforced, point out that animals are trapped, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=467.74s)]
*  trapped, and catabolized, too often the government at the best of the industry goes after [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=471.02000000000004s)]
*  the people blowing the whistle instead of the people who are actually committing the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=475.7s)]
*  crimes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=478.78000000000003s)]
*  I remember when I first started reporting on the atrocities in factory farms, one of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=480.3s)]
*  the great difficulties as a journalist, as a human being that I face and continue to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=485.06s)]
*  face when I do it, is that some of the barbarism and torture and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=489.42s)]
*  savagery is so extreme that it's actually difficult to get yourself to look at it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=494.74s)]
*  There's like an instinct to want to turn away because as humans we kind of have an [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=501.18s)]
*  instinct to turn away. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=505.74s)]
*  Talk about some of the worst things that you've seen in the many times that you've [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=507.34s)]
*  gone into these industrialized factory farms and what is it that you've seen that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=512.78s)]
*  you think people should know about? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=518.06s)]
*  The pork industry is maybe one of the most disturbing examples because it's been in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=522.74s)]
*  the national political conversation recently with the Biden administration, supporting [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=528.26s)]
*  the pork industry and trying to basically abolish Prop 12, which is the California [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=532.14s)]
*  ballot initiative that freed animals, including mother pigs from cages and crates. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=537.1s)]
*  And just to give you the factual context, the gestation creates that this law of ban [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=541.42s)]
*  that again, overwhelmingly California voters wanted, gestation crates are two foot [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=546.06s)]
*  by seven foot metal boxes, so 14 square feet of space where a 600 to 700 pound animal [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  will live virtually her entire adult life. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=559.02s)]
*  So the way I try and visualize for most people who don't have experience in farms is [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=562.42s)]
*  imagine two of the largest human beings, say, NFL linemen living inside a bathtub [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=567.62s)]
*  for their entire lives. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=574.06s)]
*  That's a gestation crate. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=575.5400000000001s)]
*  And as a result of this confinement, even industry publications show that 92 percent [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=577.1s)]
*  of animals are going psychotic within an hour. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=582.46s)]
*  Like these animals develop repetitive behaviors, they have a shoulder sores and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=584.86s)]
*  taping holes in their side because they're slamming their heads, their bodies against [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  the concrete floor or the cage wire walls around them in a desperate attempt to escape. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=593.1800000000001s)]
*  And this happens for four to five years. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=598.5s)]
*  There's no one who can see an animal living in what seems like essentially a metal tomb [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=602.5s)]
*  who is not a gasp about the problem. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=607.74s)]
*  As you put it, is that most people kind of don't even want to look at it because it's [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=611.3000000000001s)]
*  so nightmarish. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=615.6600000000001s)]
*  It feels like it has to come from a horror movie. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=616.74s)]
*  And when you realize it's not a horror movie, this is actually happening in a factory farm. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=618.5s)]
*  It's just a couple of hours away. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=623.1400000000001s)]
*  It's hard to believe and it's hard to tolerate. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=625.3000000000001s)]
*  The thing you mentioned earlier is dogs being kind of the gateway into your broader animal [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=628.02s)]
*  activism, I think is so important because if you look at how people respond to abuse [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=632.5799999999999s)]
*  of dogs, if someone, there's a video on the Internet of somebody kicking a dog or somebody [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=638.7399999999999s)]
*  punching a dog, the indignation is through the roof. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=644.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the Internet will want that person, you know, hung at high noon, if not worse. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=647.9399999999999s)]
*  And yet you have all these animals who are subject to abuse far worse than that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=655.7s)]
*  And a lot of times I think people assume, well, those aren't quite like dogs, so there's [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=661.62s)]
*  no reason why I should care as much. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  Talk a little bit about the capacity of, say, an animal like a pig to have sentience or [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=668.42s)]
*  intelligence or emotional sophistication or how social they are in order to kind of explain [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=676.82s)]
*  why it's not actually any better when, say, pigs or cows are subjected to abuse far worse [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=683.7s)]
*  than dogs. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=691.3000000000001s)]
*  Pigs are a great example because there have been a lot of fascinating experiments recently [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=694.26s)]
*  showing that pigs are not only more intelligent than a dog but significantly smarter than [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=697.62s)]
*  a human child. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=702.4200000000001s)]
*  So, for example, Purdue University did this experiment recently where they taught pigs [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=703.1400000000001s)]
*  to play a video game, kind of like pop, with them moving to the ground with their snout. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=707.5400000000001s)]
*  And they would get a treat, a little reward for doing this. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=712.1s)]
*  But one of the fascinating things about this study was that even after the pigs stopped [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=714.34s)]
*  getting treats for playing the game, the scientists found the pigs still wanted to play. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=718.42s)]
*  They were just getting stimulation and enjoyment from playing this video game in the same way [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=723.3s)]
*  that you or I would. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=726.98s)]
*  And this is something that is very, very hard to do. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=727.86s)]
*  But it's not just pigs, even chickens, which are probably the most abused farm animal on [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=730.58s)]
*  the face of the planet. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=734.18s)]
*  There was a recent publication in Science Magazine showing that chickens had passed [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=734.82s)]
*  the mirror test of self-awareness so they can look in a mirror and recognize, hey, that's [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=739.14s)]
*  me. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=742.74s)]
*  And this is something that dogs and cats actually can't do. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=743.38s)]
*  Dogs and cats, many of us probably had hilarious experiences where dogs looking into a mirror [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=745.78s)]
*  and thinking there's another dog in the mirror. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=750.66s)]
*  Well, a chicken is smart enough to figure that out. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=753.14s)]
*  Yet we subject literally billions of chickens to confinement that is so intense that they [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=754.8199999999999s)]
*  never get to step outside. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=759.54s)]
*  They never see the sky. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=760.58s)]
*  They can barely even spread their wings without touching the side of an enclosure, doing cage [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=761.9399999999999s)]
*  or another animal. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=766.02s)]
*  And so when you start realizing this, these living beings that are sentient, that are [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=767.46s)]
*  intelligent, and have compassion and love, they want to be around the people they like, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=771.22s)]
*  the people they love, their families, just like us, just like a dog or a cat, you start [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=774.9000000000001s)]
*  realizing, as you put it, Glenn, that what's happening in factory farms is an atrocity. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=779.5400000000001s)]
*  Wayne, the first story I ever reported on involving your group was a case where you [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=784.82s)]
*  had rescued two little baby pigs from a Smithfield facility that has billions of pigs. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=791.0600000000001s)]
*  And these two little pigs were baby pigs, very close to death. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=798.42s)]
*  They would have almost certainly died had you not rescued them. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=802.1800000000001s)]
*  And so their market value was zero. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=805.22s)]
*  Maybe their market value was $30. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  And yet you ended up being charged with felonies and threatened with felonies. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=810.26s)]
*  And I think one of the things, politically speaking, that has happened over the last [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=815.54s)]
*  several years is that a lot of people on the populist right and on the populist left have [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=819.54s)]
*  come to understand that our government and our legislatures are corrupted because the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=824.42s)]
*  same special interests and corporations fund both parties and can control the laws that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=830.26s)]
*  get passed. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=834.42s)]
*  But they've also come to understand that law enforcement agencies are often weaponized [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=835.54s)]
*  and abused. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=840.42s)]
*  The FBI, Homeland Security, the Justice Department, state police forces, in order to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=841.06s)]
*  attack and demonize and destroy any kind of political dissent. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=847.14s)]
*  This is something that I think people are becoming more and more aware of. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=852.3399999999999s)]
*  And yet one of the things that I think sometimes gets overlooked, people are aware that [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=855.54s)]
*  groups that say are right-wing extremists or anti-government activists or people involved in [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=859.7800000000001s)]
*  activism around abortion are often considered to be terrorists by Homeland Security or by [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=867.7s)]
*  this US security state. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=875.1400000000001s)]
*  But one of the biggest examples of people who have had the law brought down on them in [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=876.82s)]
*  the harshest ways are animal rights activists where you get charged with felonies or even [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=882.4200000000001s)]
*  possible terrorism charges even though you're not using anything remotely approaching violence [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=886.9s)]
*  such as in the case that I just described where you invaded a factory farm. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=892.74s)]
*  That's true but you also then only rescued two little small baby pigs and did no other [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=896.9s)]
*  damage. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=901.4599999999999s)]
*  Talk about the legal frameworks that have arisen that have allowed animal rights activists [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=902.26s)]
*  to be subjected to some of the most, the heaviest and gravest types of prosecution and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=906.9s)]
*  punishment that the law provides. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=913.06s)]
*  The Utah case is a great example, Glenn, because you're right, what we did was completely nonviolent. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=917.38s)]
*  We didn't even damage the property. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=922.1s)]
*  They didn't even know we were there until we published our video in the New York Times a [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=923.54s)]
*  few months later. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=927.38s)]
*  In Utah, the state attorney general with the support of the FBI brought felony racketeering [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=929.6999999999999s)]
*  charges which are the second highest level felony, felony burglary charges and felony [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=935.54s)]
*  theft charges for taking two sick baby pigs to the vet. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=939.78s)]
*  The racketeering charge was the most terrifying because this is a charge that is extremely [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=944.34s)]
*  hard to fight against. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=949.3s)]
*  It's very similar to the conspiracy charges that have been brought against activists and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=950.1s)]
*  actually have been brought against Donald Trump too across the country. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=953.62s)]
*  The idea behind it is even if you personally didn't do anything to damage anyone's property, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=957.06s)]
*  even if you personally didn't commit a crime, merely by your association and speech, by [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=961.54s)]
*  your advocacy, you show you're part of an unlawful illegal enterprise and illegal conspiracy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=966.18s)]
*  One of the most fascinating things about Utah case is one of the parties that was advocating [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=972.34s)]
*  for the case we brought against us was the CEO of Costco. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=977.22s)]
*  Now Costco is headquartered in Seattle and had absolutely nothing to do with what happened [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=981.94s)]
*  in Utah at that factory farm. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=986.0200000000001s)]
*  The factory farm is owned by Costco. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=987.0600000000001s)]
*  But Costco's CEO was concerned because of our quote defamatory protest. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=990.58s)]
*  I still haven't figured out what we said that was false about Costco. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=994.74s)]
*  All we said was Costco says they're giving freedom to animals. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=997.1400000000001s)]
*  This is the condition the animals are actually living in. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1000.1s)]
*  But because of this racketeering conspiracy charge, the FBI and the state government in [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1002.58s)]
*  Utah were able to tie together all of our activities across the country. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1008.02s)]
*  Our protests, all of which were nonviolent and peaceful. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1012.26s)]
*  Our statements to the media, our videos published on YouTube to say we're involved in this [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1014.66s)]
*  illegal conspiracy to damage a large corporate interest. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1019.86s)]
*  I can tell you none of us are going to get the sort of protection from the FBI, from [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1024.34s)]
*  lawyers. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1028.02s)]
*  And the fact that there were dozens of FBI agents at our trial that came out that dozens [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1029.06s)]
*  of FBI agents were involved in a case involving at most $80 of commercial value, really much [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1032.82s)]
*  less than that because each of these piglets was sick to the point they were probably a [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1038.18s)]
*  liability to the company, should be shocking to most American consumers and citizens, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1041.7s)]
*  regardless of whether you're a Democrat or a Republican. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1046.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll never forget just being stunned. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1050.9s)]
*  And obviously I've been working for a long time on abuses of state power for political [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1053.62s)]
*  ends that you took two tiny little piglets who, as you say, probably had negative commercial [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1057.3s)]
*  value to these factory farms because they were likely to become sick and die. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1062.82s)]
*  Even if you want to give it the most credit, it was, as you say, $80, $40 each pig. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1067.62s)]
*  And yet they dispatched the FBI to do searches and seizures at farms where they had suspected [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1072.98s)]
*  these pigs were. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1079.94s)]
*  And the FBI agents had to come and snip off parts of the ears of these pigs to get DNA [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1081.1399999999999s)]
*  samples to try and prove that these were the pigs that you had actually taken, a grand [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1086.82s)]
*  total of two. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1091.3s)]
*  And to watch the FBI deployed on behalf of an industry that obviously has no concern [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1092.74s)]
*  about the commercial damage you're doing, except to the extent that you're reporting [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1099.9399999999998s)]
*  in your activism is exposing their abuses was really stunning in terms of how much [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwLKkWOIpo&t=1103.3799999999999s)]
