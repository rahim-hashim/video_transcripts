# What Trump's Garbage Truck Stunt Reveals About His Personality & The Media In 2024
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4)
*  There is actually an election day that is only five days away that will determine who the next president of the United States will be and which party controls the executive branch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's obviously consequential. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=15.74s)]
*  There's also elections that will determine the composition of the United States Senate and the U.S. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=17.94s)]
*  House as well that are part of that same process. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=23.02s)]
*  And I just wanted to give you a little bit of our perspective and analysis on this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=26.02s)]
*  First of all, ever since I've been writing about politics and doing journalism, the part of the year that I've always hated the most is in the weeks or even a month or two months leading into a especially a national election. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=30.2s)]
*  I remember in 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020 again now, the same sort of unpleasantries happen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=43.5s)]
*  First of all, people who are partisan get even more partisan, meaning people just lose any interest in what's happening in the world, in what's true. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  And the only thing they care about is saying things or doing things that help one party, their candidate and damage the other. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=64.98s)]
*  And I don't blame them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=71.38s)]
*  I'm not criticizing that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=72.26s)]
*  That is what political activism is for. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=73.9s)]
*  That is what political activism should be about, doing everything possible to elect a particular candidate or political campaign. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=75.9s)]
*  But I don't see this show. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=83.26s)]
*  I don't see myself as being a political activist. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=84.86s)]
*  I try very hard to keep journalism separate from that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=87.98s)]
*  And that is something very important to me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=90.66s)]
*  It's a major criticism I have in fact of the current corporate media is that they have become political activists. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  So that's not really an option to just sit here and cheer every night for a candidate. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=97.34s)]
*  There are a lot of shows doing very well, attracting a lot of attention and readership and traffic and profit that do that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  That's certainly something we can do, but it wouldn't be honest for me if I were to do it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=109.02s)]
*  It's something I've never done. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=112.46s)]
*  Then the other option is you can try and talk about the discourse surrounding the election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=114.74s)]
*  The problem is that all the things about the discourse, political discourse in the United States that are dishonest or kind of unhinged or hysterical become infinitely worse every day as the election approaches. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=120.54s)]
*  Again, for totally understandable reasons, people are stressed about the outcome. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=131.66s)]
*  They're doing everything possible as the election approaches to try and say or do anything in order to get their candidate elected. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=136.78s)]
*  That's why we have flying accusations about the Trump campaign now being Hitler. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=142.78s)]
*  And all this deranged commentary coming from the US media that gets worse and worse as we approach the election. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=148.34s)]
*  So even covering the discourse tends to be difficult unless you can really dig in and dismantle it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=154.26s)]
*  And then the other thing that you could do that's I think quite easy to do that a lot of programs do with great success again is just sort of analyze the horse race aspects of the campaign to sort of say, here's the latest poll. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=158.66s)]
*  Look at this new poll. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=173.46s)]
*  It shows Trump ahead by two in Michigan. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=174.34s)]
*  Well, look at this new poll. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=177.5s)]
*  It shows Kamala ahead by three in Wisconsin. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=178.62s)]
*  And then just every night you kind of promote a new poll. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=182.3s)]
*  You can cherry pick them based on which ones you think your audience wants to hear. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=185.06s)]
*  And for so many reasons, I don't think that's a fruitful way to spend time, including the fact that polls have been unbelievably unreliable. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=189.18s)]
*  Especially with the emergence of Donald Trump and his movement, pollsters just have no clue yet how to understand who Trump voters are, how to reach them, how to analyze them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=198.14s)]
*  In 2016, the New York Times had it as something like 92% certain, 94% certain that Hillary Clinton was going to win. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=210.54s)]
*  Every poll showed Hillary Clinton way, way in front. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=219.9s)]
*  I didn't know a single person basically who thought Trump was going to win, and they were basing that on the assumption that the polls they were looking at were reliable. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=222.94s)]
*  And of course, Trump won that election and won it by a good margin. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=231.3s)]
*  The polls were way, way off, at least in a state by state level. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=233.98s)]
*  And then heading into 2020, the same thing happened. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=238.78s)]
*  The poll showed Joe Biden even further in front of Donald Trump than it showed Hillary Clinton in front of Trump in 2016. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=243.78s)]
*  And although Biden was certified as the winner of that election, it was extremely close. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=251.5s)]
*  An election could easily have slung to Trump with the change of 30 or 40,000 votes on a couple of swing states. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=256.5s)]
*  So the polls again created this wildly misleading picture. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=262.3s)]
*  And then it actually happened in 2022 in the opposite direction when Trump wasn't on the ballot. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=264.98s)]
*  And a lot of polling companies and therefore a lot of media outlets were insisting that there was going to be this massive red wave [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=269.82s)]
*  that would flood both the Senate and the House with all sorts of new Republicans or remove Democratic incumbents. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=276.41999999999996s)]
*  And although the Republicans did manage to take over the House, it did so by a tiny margin compared to how [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=281.26s)]
*  midterm elections have usually functioned for the opposing party in office that usually does very well in midterm. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=290.06s)]
*  Republicans didn't have a very successful 2022 midterm. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  And so, again, the polls were off, although this time Trump wasn't on the ballot. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  So it doesn't mean that they compensated too much for their failures in 2016 and 2020. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=303.58s)]
*  The fact that Trump supported just means that with Trump not on the ballot, they also couldn't figure things out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=309.82s)]
*  So now Trump's on the ballot again. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  And I think there's a conventional wisdom that I think I'm prey to as well that we've just seen in the last two times when Trump was on the ballot running for president, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  the poll showed Trump with a huge disadvantage against both of his opponents in 2016 and 2020. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=330.42s)]
*  And both times polls severely underestimated the level of support of Donald Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  So when you see polls this time that are showing basically Trump tied with Kamala Harris, not just in individual states, but nationally, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=344.26s)]
*  which thinking about the popular vote that both Biden and Hillary won by a lot, if Trump is even tied with the popular vote or just a point or two behind, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=354.74s)]
*  the assumption, of course, instinctively, is that, well, it seems like the polls must be undercounting Trump's support again because they still haven't figured out how to detect Trump supporters. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=366.5s)]
*  But who knows? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=375.22s)]
*  Maybe they have now overcompensated knowing that they undercounted Trump voters in the last two elections and now are showing more Trump support than really exists, are showing a closer election than really will happen. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=377.02s)]
*  So even if I were to try and analyze polls, they're not very predictive. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=390.1s)]
*  They've proven not to be very predictive. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=399.26s)]
*  It's kind of just a way of satiating yourself because you want to know the results. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=401.14s)]
*  And so they help you think that you're understanding the results. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=405.22s)]
*  And so there's not much to say about the election other than when we find things that we think are revealing about broader political trends like tonight. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=408.9s)]
*  I don't think the Joe Biden comment was particularly significant. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=417.22s)]
*  I think the reaction to it by the media was I think Joe Biden's cognitive disability is significant. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=419.54s)]
*  So we use it to extract that meaning of it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=425.42s)]
*  But to sit there and cover the election as the election, I think, is very difficult. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=427.7s)]
*  So nonetheless, I know that's what people want to hear about. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=431.02s)]
*  So sometimes we do cover it, but only when we think we have something meaningful to say. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=435.14s)]
*  If you were to put a gun to my head and force me to make a prediction, I suppose I would say I think Trump is going to win just because in 2016 and 2020, they wildly undercounted his support. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=440.34s)]
*  Where if they do that, even to a small extent this time, given what the polls show, it means that he's likely to win. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=452.98s)]
*  There's been a lot of disturbing trends of people who think the United States is wildly on the wrong track, which usually means that's bad for the incumbent. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=458.9s)]
*  There's a lot of traditional Democratic voters, Latinos and black people and other non-white voters who are clearly migrated away from the Democrats to the Republican Party. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=465.54s)]
*  There's more enthusiasm for Donald Trump as a candidate than there is for Kamala Harris. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=475.98s)]
*  And so I don't know anything about anybody else, but that's what I would say. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=481.17999999999995s)]
*  Now, I just want to end with this because I think this in so many ways illustrates why Trump as a political phenomenon is so singular and unique in American politics. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=485.29999999999995s)]
*  Why elites in particular have so much difficulty understanding his appeal. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=497.5s)]
*  Why they really do believe that anyone who votes for him is a racist or a fascist or stupid. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=502.85999999999996s)]
*  And you keep hearing them say things that reflect that when in reality Trump's appeal is so obvious. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=508.3s)]
*  The most obvious being that he spews contempt at and vandalizes and even defecates on the most cherished and sacred pieties of American political institutions and the ruling class status quo, which is what people hate more than anything. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=515.38s)]
*  And we've seen this work in many other countries where all you have to do is say that you're here to destroy institutional authority that people have come to hate throughout the Democratic world and any candidate who does that will successfully attract people to them. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  I think that's the reason why Obama won in 2008, despite a lot of reasons why he probably shouldn't have all the barriers he faced because he was able to convince people even though it was a fraud. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=552.3s)]
*  I'm not from Washington. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=563.5400000000001s)]
*  I've barely been here. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=565.46s)]
*  Look at me. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=567.7s)]
*  I'm not part of the political class. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=568.26s)]
*  I'm here to use people power behind me to change the way Washington works and the people for whom it works. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=570.74s)]
*  And that was convincing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=578.7s)]
*  People crave that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=579.62s)]
*  And he was able to channel that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=581.26s)]
*  Now, of course, he got in. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=583.1s)]
*  He was nothing but an agent of status quo perpetuation. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=584.0200000000001s)]
*  But I think that was his appeal. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=587.7s)]
*  And that's obviously Trump's appeal too. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=588.6600000000001s)]
*  Whenever Trump does things that the press gets horrified about or that Democrats and liberals and elites are enraged by, it reinforces this idea that Trump is on the side of the people. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=590.14s)]
*  And that's why institutional authorities that they despise, including the media, especially the media, hate so much. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=602.66s)]
*  So I just want to give you a couple of examples just from the last 24 hours of how this works. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=609.98s)]
*  So as we covered, the big media narrative of the day is that Joe Biden called Trump supporters, quote, garbage. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=617.38s)]
*  And in response, Donald Trump has been walking around all day wearing the uniform of a garbage collector. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=624.14s)]
*  And they got a garbage truck that he's riding around in that says Trump 2024 on the side. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=632.5s)]
*  And here he was asked questions from the media. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=638.86s)]
*  So he's elevated above the media. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=642.1400000000001s)]
*  They have to look up at this truck while he's wearing the uniform of a garbage collector, just like he wore the uniform of McDonald's worker last week or the week before. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=644.4200000000001s)]
*  And this is the exchange that they had. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=657.4200000000001s)]
*  I love Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico loves me. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=664.1s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know anything about it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=666.62s)]
*  Comedian. I just I love Puerto Rico. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=668.46s)]
*  Nobody's done more for Puerto Rico than me. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=671.5s)]
*  I took care of them when they had the big hurricanes and nobody nobody gets along better with Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican people than me. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=673.78s)]
*  They love me and I love them. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=682.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry, but you cannot deny that that's funny. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=685.98s)]
*  That it's just it's very it's just so indifferent to the demands and expectations made of him by liberal elites. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=690.02s)]
*  He's like, yeah, there was some comedian. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=699.9399999999999s)]
*  I have no idea who it is. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=701.22s)]
*  I don't even know what he said. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=702.1s)]
*  But Puerto Rico, I love Puerto Rico. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=703.58s)]
*  Puerto Rico loves me. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=705.1s)]
*  Nobody's ever done more for Puerto Rico than I have. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=706.02s)]
*  And for so long, it was taboo in media circles and real circles to admit that Trump is naturally hilarious. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=710.86s)]
*  He's naturally funny. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=718.94s)]
*  He's a showman. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=720.02s)]
*  Can you imagine Kamala Harris doing something like this? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=722.5s)]
*  Could you imagine her putting on a McDonald's uniform? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=724.9s)]
*  Could you imagine her? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=726.78s)]
*  She won't even speak off the cuff. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=728.26s)]
*  They don't let her speak unscripted, except in the friendliest of environments. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  And so often there, she embarrasses herself because she so and we've seen this as vice president to the reason why she embarrassed herself on so many occasions is because she was petrified of speaking in an unscripted way because she has no confidence in her knowledge or her grasp of the situation. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=733.9s)]
*  And when you're that insecure, you get awkward. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=750.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you all have that experience where you're insecure. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=755.3s)]
*  You feel insecure in a social situation. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=757.42s)]
*  You lose your personality. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=758.98s)]
*  You lose your ability to be funny. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=760.1800000000001s)]
*  You lose your ability to just be smooth and natural with people. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=761.5s)]
*  It comes from this insecurity that she reeks of. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=764.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, she can give a speech by now and read off a teleprompter and seem effective with it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=768.78s)]
*  In very controlled settings like the debate with Trump, she did well. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=776.46s)]
*  But when she has to just just act like a normal human being, to me, she always looks like somebody who just walked out of it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=780.26s)]
*  She looks like somebody who just walked out of an Aetna board meeting. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=787.74s)]
*  Like she looks like she's on the board of directors of an insurance company. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=790.66s)]
*  Maybe it's general counsel. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=793.34s)]
*  And she always looks like she just comes out of the corporate world. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=794.7s)]
*  Everything about her is emanating of that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=797.82s)]
*  And I remember one time in when I lived in New York City in the early 1990s, when I think I've told this story before, but Trump was very famous, very, very well known. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=803.38s)]
*  This is before he was a very successful star of a prime time show on NBC, The Apprentice. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=815.22s)]
*  But he was known as this kind of gallivanting billionaire, this very charismatic figure. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=820.94s)]
*  The tabloids loved him. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=825.82s)]
*  Celebrities loved him. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=826.98s)]
*  And I remember he went to visit a building in New Jersey that he was building some gigantic structure. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=828.86s)]
*  And instead of going there and speaking with the financiers or the bankers, he ended up just hanging out the entire time with the construction workers. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=835.74s)]
*  And then afterward, he said to the media, anyone can be famous among elites. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=843.74s)]
*  Real fame is when working class people, the workers know who you are and scream your name. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=848.22s)]
*  That's what he cares about. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=853.82s)]
*  He's always cared about the most. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=854.9s)]
*  He always has had this resentment, the kind that Richard Nixon had, even though he grew up wealthy. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=856.0600000000001s)]
*  He grew up in an outer borough in Queens. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=860.14s)]
*  And there's a lot of resentment of Manhattan elites. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=862.86s)]
*  I think that's why Trump wanted to go and build these gigantic buildings in Manhattan that towered over everybody else and live at the top of Trump Tower, because it was a way of sort of taking this [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=864.62s)]
*  vengeance and this resentment against elites that just comes natural to him. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=873.5s)]
*  His contempt for these people is real. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=878.34s)]
*  And you cannot replicate that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=881.26s)]
*  Here is Trump getting off of his plane today, and he's again wearing his sanitary worker uniform. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=885.98s)]
*  They actually have labeled us, and that's what the scary part is. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=894.42s)]
*  But yet it seems to be kind of normal that we would hear this kind of rhetoric and degrading talk coming from the president and the administration. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=897.86s)]
*  You know, do you remember that conversation? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=907.3399999999999s)]
*  I think it was between Peter Struck and Lisa Page, where they were talking about Walmart, about how it smells like Trump supporters. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=909.4599999999999s)]
*  Tara is exactly right, Grant. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=915.5799999999999s)]
*  They have been talking about talking about Trump supporters like this for for a very long time. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=917.0999999999999s)]
*  Amanda, think about this. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=924.42s)]
*  We're watching our screen where President Trump's Trump Force One has landed. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=926.5s)]
*  You've got a gentleman walking down. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=929.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, he gets on the plane, walking in a garbage man uniform to remind people of what Biden said, and then he walks past the media and then gets into the truck [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=943.5s)]
*  that says Trump 2024, make America great on the side. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=952.5s)]
*  And then he says to the media, now I'll take your questions. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=955.14s)]
*  And they all have to kind of come and gather around him beneath him and look up to him and ask questions. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=957.74s)]
*  And he says things like, I love Puerto Rico. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=963.3s)]
*  Puerto Ricans love Puerto Rico as me. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=965.46s)]
*  This is, I think, something that is political power of the kind that you can't really quantify. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=969.1s)]
*  You can't really understand that people in the media have just refused to acknowledge. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=976.5s)]
*  They can't even acknowledge that he has political skill. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=985.38s)]
*  They can't acknowledge that he appeals to people for reasons other than the fact that they're racist and misogynist and Islamophobic and xenophobic. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=988.26s)]
*  All the things that Hillary Clinton accused them of being, all the things Obama accused them of being, all the things that liberal media accused them of being every day. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=996.4599999999999s)]
*  And I also think that's why this obsession with trying to call him Hitler and being a fascist, when the country has seen him for five decades, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1002.86s)]
*  including four years in the White House, now to just try and convince them that this person they've known all along and have seen operate all along in so many different contexts, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1013.14s)]
*  is actually a new Hitler. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1022.98s)]
*  I think it's just the kind of media narrative that pleads to themselves. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1026.02s)]
*  They're captive to their audience. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1030.62s)]
*  They are constantly validating and feeding one another in their views. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1031.94s)]
*  And it's made them almost blind to the realities of Trump and to his support. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1036.7s)]
*  Now, again, I don't have any idea who's going to win. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1042.66s)]
*  The Democrats have a huge financial advantage. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1045.22s)]
*  Kamala raised over a billion dollars in the last three months alone. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1047.7s)]
*  There is a lot of hostility and fear that has been ginned up against Trump. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1051.26s)]
*  I think the biggest political gift to the Democrats ever was the overturning of Roe versus Wade in the Dobbs decision that clearly galvanized a huge number of Democratic voters or people who weren't necessarily attached to the Democratic Party to come out and vote solely on that issue. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1056.9399999999998s)]
*  So I genuinely don't know who's going to win. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1070.6999999999998s)]
*  But what I do know is that the media just cannot, is so blind with hatred and rage and fear of Donald Trump, which I think is very genuine, that it has completely blinded them to the realities, not just Donald Trump, but especially to the people who support him and the reasons why they do so. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1072.98s)]
*  You can also find full episodes of The Morning After they air across all major podcasting platforms, including Spotify and Apple. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQ8mKTvTP4&t=1102.98s)]
