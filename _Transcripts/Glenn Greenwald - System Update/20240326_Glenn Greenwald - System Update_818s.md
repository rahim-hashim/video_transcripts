# Huberman Hit Piece Exposes Corrupt Media Priorities
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www)
*  All right, for our last story, I want to talk about a New York magazine cover story on someone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=0.0s)]
*  named Andrew Huberman. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=12.48s)]
*  Now, Andrew Huberman, and it's really interesting how fame works these days. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=13.84s)]
*  In one sense, Andrew Huberman has become a very popular and famous person. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=18.56s)]
*  He has millions of people who listen to his podcast. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=22.8s)]
*  Now, I was talking to our team about this earlier today about how fame works now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=27.8s)]
*  Fame has become so fragmented. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=31.48s)]
*  There are so many people who, in one sense, have become quite famous. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=33.28s)]
*  They have millions of fans, millions of people who listen to them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  And yet, if you don't listen to them, if you're not a fan of Andrew Huberman's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=42.44s)]
*  broadcast, it's very likely that you've never heard of Andrew Huberman. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=47.0s)]
*  And so fame is this very fragmented thing where there's a lot of people who have very [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=50.96s)]
*  popular YouTube shows and say comedy or culture or streaming or podcasts. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=54.88s)]
*  And they have bigger audiences than almost every one of these mainstream media [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=62.68s)]
*  corporation shows. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=69.0s)]
*  You have 500,000 people watching CNN. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=70.84s)]
*  You have millions of people listening to the podcast of Andrew Huberman. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  So he's very famous in one sense, and yet a lot of people haven't heard of him in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  another. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  That's true for so many people now who influence, who wield influence in our [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=80.12s)]
*  media culture. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's because of the decentralization of what the internet has [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=85.84s)]
*  done. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=88.56s)]
*  There's not just a tiny handful of corporations any longer controlling the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  flow of information. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  People can find whoever they want to listen to by the millions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=94.04s)]
*  And these people become much more influential than those who work inside [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=98.0s)]
*  these media corporations. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=102.28s)]
*  Obviously, Joe Rogan is a perfect example of somebody who hasn't worked for a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=103.16s)]
*  media corporation in many years. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=107.0s)]
*  He worked for NBC News 25 years ago as the host of a reality TV show for a couple [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=108.36s)]
*  years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  But by and large, Joe Rogan built up his entire massive audience outside of the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=113.08s)]
*  structure and framework and therefore the rules of corporate media. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=118.88s)]
*  And that's the reason corporate media hates him so much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=122.16s)]
*  Andrew Huberman is somebody who has done the same. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=126.24s)]
*  He's a neuroscientist. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=128.04s)]
*  A few years ago, I think in 2019, 2020, he started a podcast. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=130.24s)]
*  And like so many people during the pandemic, when people couldn't go out, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=133.24s)]
*  they were online all the time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=137.64s)]
*  He found a massive audience. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=139.56s)]
*  Talks a lot about neuroscience, but about self-help. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=142.04s)]
*  I have to confess, I've never listened to his program before. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=144.76s)]
*  I'm not very well aware of him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't have a strong opinion about him one way or the other. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=149.44s)]
*  I've seen his name around. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=151.68s)]
*  I knew he had a popular podcast. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=153.12s)]
*  But I'm not here to defend Andrew Huberman because I don't really know much [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=155.2s)]
*  about him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  What I saw, though, was a bunch of media people today promoting a story, a cover [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=161.16s)]
*  story that is on New York magazine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=164.52s)]
*  His face appears on New York magazine. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  And here you see it on the screen. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=170.8s)]
*  Andrew Huberman's Mechanisms of Control. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=172.08s)]
*  The private and public seductions of the world's biggest pop neuroscientist. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  And it's written by a New York magazine journalist named Carrie Holly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=181.12s)]
*  And I saw a bunch of media people talking about this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Like it was some big Me Too scandal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  There was a bunch of shameful, dirty secrets in Andrew Huberman's dating life [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=194.32s)]
*  that had been exposed by this article. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  I stopped congratulating her. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=201.84s)]
*  And I assume that there were a bunch of stories similar to a report of the kind [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  that they did on Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports, who they obviously hate as well, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=208.96s)]
*  where they tried to Me Too him in a way that I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=220.68s)]
*  think turned out to be very factually dubious at best. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=223.92s)]
*  But I assumed it was that kind of an article, by the way people were talking [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=231.2s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=233.72s)]
*  Oh, he's been exposed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=234.2s)]
*  He's a very abusive person. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  And I began reading through this article expecting to find that, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  because there's a lot of people in the media talking about it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=242.0s)]
*  I assumed there was something really dark and sinister here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  And the more I began reading it, I kept reading it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=248.72s)]
*  It went on and on and on and on and on. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=252.0s)]
*  It was this endless article. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=254.12s)]
*  And it was basically nothing other than reporting on his adult dating life. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=255.32s)]
*  He's a 48-year-old man. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=261.2s)]
*  He is very focused on fitness. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=262.48s)]
*  He's very big. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=266.64s)]
*  He's very muscular, conventionally handsome. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=267.36s)]
*  A lot of women find him handsome. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=269.64s)]
*  That's part of his appeal. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=271.56s)]
*  It's the reason why a lot of people listen to him. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=272.52s)]
*  And he's unmarried. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=275.24s)]
*  He's a bachelor. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=276.56s)]
*  He's wealthy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=277.32s)]
*  He's a neuroscientist. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=278.88s)]
*  He has a lot of charisma. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=280.36s)]
*  That's why people watch him. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=281.2s)]
*  And so as you can imagine him, he dates a lot of women. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=282.0s)]
*  And this article tried to destroy his reputation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  You can see here it's framed his mechanisms of control. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=289.8s)]
*  So you assume it's some kind of article about his abuse with women, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=294.52s)]
*  his misogynistic network of women that he's manipulated and abused [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  non-consensually. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=305.36s)]
*  That's what you're expecting. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=306.28s)]
*  And you're reading it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=307.24s)]
*  And you're reading it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's just basically nothing other than a report interviewing women [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=309.32s)]
*  that he is dating and still has dating. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  And I guess the worst thing that they found out about him [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=316.64s)]
*  was that he was dating women who didn't realize he had other girlfriends [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=323.4s)]
*  He wasn't married to any of them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing in this article that's even [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=327.76s)]
*  journalistically justified to publish, let alone something that's scandalous. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=331.2s)]
*  I was actually going to go through it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=336.76000000000005s)]
*  And actually now that I'm thinking about it, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=338.56s)]
*  I don't even want to give it that level of attention. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=341.56s)]
*  I guess one of the things that it alleges to try and justify itself [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=343.6s)]
*  is that there was a woman he was dating who had unprotected sex with him. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=347.8s)]
*  And she says it was because she assumed they were monogamous when, in fact, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=354.24s)]
*  he was dating somebody else, which I guess [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=358.72s)]
*  means that the minute you become a public figure at this point, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=360.92s)]
*  not even if you hold public office, he's not a senator. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=365.28s)]
*  He's not a cabinet official. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=368.28s)]
*  He's not somebody who wields public power. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=370.4s)]
*  He's a podcast host. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=372.76s)]
*  But he's not even married. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=376.44s)]
*  So it's not even adultery. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=377.52s)]
*  I guess the worst thing you can say about him is that he dated a woman [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=379.32s)]
*  and was dating a different woman without one of the women knowing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=383.47999999999996s)]
*  And if this is the stuff of cover stories now, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=388.2s)]
*  then I guess it means that it's fair game [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=391.76s)]
*  to go around following every single journalist [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=394.56s)]
*  and tracking their private lives and seeing who they're working with. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=398.52s)]
*  I guess I should read some of this since I'm commenting on it, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=403.56s)]
*  just to give you a sense for how filthy and baseless [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  this entire article is to try and ruin the reputation of somebody [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=411.96s)]
*  whose crime is that they have developed a much bigger audience than anybody [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=416.32s)]
*  at New York magazine possibly could and has done so on their own. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=421.36s)]
*  Quote, Sarah's relationship with Andrew began in February 2018 [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  in the Bay Area where they both lived. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=429.88s)]
*  Sarah was willing to have unprotected sex [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=431.6s)]
*  because she believed they were monogamous. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=433.8s)]
*  Through a spokesman, Huberman says he did not [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  become exclusive with Sarah until late 2021, that he was not doted on, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  that tasks between him and Sarah were shared [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=442.56s)]
*  based on mutual agreement and proficiency, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  and that their Thanksgiving plans were tentative [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  and that he maintains a very busy schedule [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=449.04s)]
*  and shows up to the vast majority of his commitments. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=450.88s)]
*  And that was because she had complained that sometimes [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=453.28s)]
*  he didn't show up for things, that he wanted, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=456.64s)]
*  he put more burden on her in the relationship [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=460.88s)]
*  than I guess he was willing to take, like, the most banal, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=463.48s)]
*  conventional, trivial, standard complaints [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=466.08s)]
*  in their relationship that they decided to air. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=470.28s)]
*  The relationship struck Sarah's friends as odd. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=472.36s)]
*  At one point, Sarah said, quote, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=476.36s)]
*  I just want to be with my kids and cook for my man. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=477.96s)]
*  I was like, who says that, says a close friend? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I've known her for 30 years. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  She's a powerful, decisive, strong woman. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=485.44s)]
*  We grew up in this very feminist community. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=487.44s)]
*  That's not a thing either of us would ever say. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  In August 2021, Sarah says she read Andrew's journal [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=492.56s)]
*  and discovered a reference to cheating. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  She was, she said, quote, gutted. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=497.2s)]
*  In 2021, she tested positive for a high-risk form of HPV, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=499.56s)]
*  one of the variants linked to cervical cancer. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=504.08s)]
*  Quote, I have never tested positive, she said, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=507.04s)]
*  and had been tested regularly for 10 years. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  A spokesman for Huberman says he has never tested positive [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=511.36s)]
*  for HPV. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=514.44s)]
*  According to the CDC, there is currently no approved test [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=515.28s)]
*  for HPV in men. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=517.64s)]
*  When she brought it up, she says, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=519.44s)]
*  he told her you could contract HPV for many things. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  Sarah said she grabbed Andrew's phone [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=523.44s)]
*  when he had left it in the bathroom, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  checked his text, and found conversations [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=526.84s)]
*  with someone we will call Eve. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=529.08s)]
*  Some of them took place during the camping trip [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=531.48s)]
*  they had just taken. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  Caught having an affair, Andrew was apologetic. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=534.72s)]
*  That's, I mean, we pretty much picked the worst parts [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  of this entire multi-thousand page article. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=541.02s)]
*  As our friend Sager and Jetty said, who's the, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=545.84s)]
*  I'm sorry, many thousands of words, not pages. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think it's at least 5,000 words, if I had to guess. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=554.48s)]
*  It's a very long article, and it goes on and on like that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=556.94s)]
*  about nothing but his dating life. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  As Sager and Jetty, the host of Breaking Board, said, quote, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=561.76s)]
*  just a few months ago, New York Magazine published [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=564.28s)]
*  a practical guide to polyamory, and yet today, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=566.36s)]
*  they're somehow so concerned about the sexual worries [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=570.34s)]
*  of the unmarried, most popular health podcaster in the world. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=572.8s)]
*  There you see the cover story celebrating polyamory. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=578.48s)]
*  I mean, I guess they would say that polyamory [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=581.28s)]
*  is a consensual relationship between more than two people, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=583.04s)]
*  whereas the crime here is that Andrew Huberman [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=587.28s)]
*  was dating women without doubt. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=589.48s)]
*  I mean, the fact that they would delve [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=590.76s)]
*  into this person's personal life, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=594.48s)]
*  there's no allegation of sexual assault or abuse, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=596.04s)]
*  let alone sexual crimes like rape [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=600.12s)]
*  or anything non-consensual at all. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=603.2s)]
*  It is these liberal outlets, and New York Magazine [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=606.96s)]
*  considers itself a serious political magazine, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=610.64s)]
*  are so trashy, they're so vindictive. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=613.84s)]
*  Really what happened was they saw somebody [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  who is very successful, he's been on Joe Rogan's show [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=618.84s)]
*  before, he encourages men to engage in self-care, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=622.44s)]
*  I guess they decided he was an ideological enemy, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=625.08s)]
*  they set out to destroy him, they dug into his personal life, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=627.6s)]
*  they really found nothing, they published it anyway, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=630.2s)]
*  these people are sick and evil. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=632.88s)]
*  Imagine setting out to try and destroy somebody's life [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=635.24s)]
*  by digging into their dating activities [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=639.0400000000001s)]
*  when they're unmarried, when there's no allegation [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=641.5s)]
*  of anything abusive, simply out of resentment [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=644.08s)]
*  that they built a popular and independent platform [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=649.08s)]
*  that they can't control. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=652.04s)]
*  I will say, as I said before, that when these people [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=655.46s)]
*  get laid off, and this is the sector, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=660.16s)]
*  the media that gets laid off so much, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=661.92s)]
*  they expect you to cry for them, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=663.4s)]
*  they demand that you feel sympathy for them, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=664.8199999999999s)]
*  and it's very difficult to feel that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=668.08s)]
*  Because this is not just trivial though it is, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=671.22s)]
*  it is deeply toxic and destructive. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=675.36s)]
*  These people, this is just a moral scumbag behavior [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=677.98s)]
*  of the worst kind. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=684.02s)]
*  And this is what they do over and over. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=685.7s)]
*  And when there's a part of an industry that is toxic, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=688.82s)]
*  if there's, say, I think that the industrial, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=693.1s)]
*  agricultural industry is guilty of all kinds [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=697.46s)]
*  of moral atrocities, they are threats to the public health, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=701.82s)]
*  when they fail, I celebrate, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  because they're toxic to our society. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=707.3399999999999s)]
*  I think they engage in a lot of harm. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=709.42s)]
*  That's the same for how I feel about this sector, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=711.9s)]
*  the media, and so when they fail, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=714.14s)]
*  it's something to celebrate. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=715.54s)]
*  It really is true that no matter how much you hate [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  this wing of the corporate media, it's really not enough. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=719.42s)]
*  And they have wrought the failure onto themselves. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=722.9399999999999s)]
*  And so if you're one of those people who celebrate [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=726.26s)]
*  when they lose their job, when they're massively off, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=728.18s)]
*  when these magazines close, don't feel guilty about that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=730.0s)]
*  It is completely well deserved, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=732.88s)]
*  and the kind of commonality between all three [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=734.88s)]
*  of these stories that we covered tonight, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=739.92s)]
*  that NBC News is so enraged [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=741.24s)]
*  that a Republican party operative might contaminate [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=743.88s)]
*  their sacred integrity, that Kara Swisher is celebrated [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=746.22s)]
*  by the very people that she claims she holds so accountable [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=748.84s)]
*  on the fact that New York Magazine set out [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=752.32s)]
*  to destroy a person for no reason other than the fact [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=754.04s)]
*  that he can't be ideologically or substantively controlled [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=757.24s)]
*  because he found an audience outside [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=760.36s)]
*  of their failing corporate structures. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=762.12s)]
*  It really is all the same thing. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=764.84s)]
*  It just shows what bitter and resentful people [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=766.1s)]
*  are inside these outlets, the fact that their failure [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=770.16s)]
*  is so well deserved, and the fact that although [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=773.26s)]
*  they brand themselves as holding power to account, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=775.14s)]
*  what they're really there for is to serve the powerful [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=778.08s)]
*  and to destroy anybody who's a dissident, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=781.9s)]
*  anybody who in any way pushes against the grain [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=784.2s)]
*  of the prevailing orthodoxies [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-UjNbb7Www&t=787.04s)]
