# Batya Ungar-Sargon Pushes Back on Israel-Gaza, International Law, & More | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw)
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=0.0s)]
*  We're thrilled to have you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=8.64s)]
*  I cannot even express to you, Glenn, how honored I am to be here with you and how grateful [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=11.4s)]
*  I am to be here with you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=17.36s)]
*  I think this is probably the most important interview I will have given in the last four [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=18.72s)]
*  weeks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=24.2s)]
*  I believe so deeply in this idea of forcing ourselves to be exposed to the other side [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=25.2s)]
*  and to people we disagree with. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  And so few people, when push comes to shove, are willing to do that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=33.2s)]
*  And it means the world to me that you are willing to expose your audience to my views, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  which I know may not be theirs. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=40.76s)]
*  And I think the world of you in general, Glenn, so I'm just so honored to be here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=42.28s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=46.6s)]
*  Yeah, I feel the same. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=47.8s)]
*  And just to be clear, I mean, there was a good chunk of our audience that most definitely [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=48.8s)]
*  is on the pro-Israel side. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=53.56s)]
*  We knew that from the beginning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=55.0s)]
*  We've heard from a lot of them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=56.2s)]
*  Most of them have said, we don't agree with your coverage. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=57.28s)]
*  We don't agree with your perspective, but we're going to stay with you because we understand [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=62.2s)]
*  what we want from you is that you do your best to be honest in your coverage. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=65.2s)]
*  But there have been some people who said, I can't watch your show anymore. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=69.52s)]
*  I can't subscribe anymore. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=71.64s)]
*  And we knew that was going to happen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=72.64s)]
*  But that's just the nature of this topic. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=74.8s)]
*  And I do absolutely agree that the more inflammatory a topic is, the more sensitive it is, the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=77.4s)]
*  more important it is to seek out dialogue as long as it's within good faith and civil. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  And that's what I knew would happen when we invited you on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=87.52s)]
*  So let's just get started this way. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  On October 7th, I sat like most people did watching these horrific videos of Israelis [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=94.44s)]
*  being terrorized, being murdered, being tortured in the most sadistic manner possible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=100.24s)]
*  People, children being carried off and kidnapped to Gaza in front of their parents, old people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  being shot in front of their children, all kinds of just horrifying stories. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=109.9s)]
*  And I think any person, decent person by definition, was enraged by what Hamas did on that day [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=114.26s)]
*  and found that there's no moral justification for it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=121.5s)]
*  That's certainly something I felt and that I've said many times since then. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=123.86s)]
*  We are now though a month later, and that means there has been a month of Israeli response. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=127.82s)]
*  And that response has largely consisted of a relentless and massive bombing campaign [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=132.3s)]
*  in Gaza, which is a place where most people cannot get out. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=138.38s)]
*  The borders are closed with Israel and long have been, and then also closed with Egypt. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=141.54s)]
*  So you have this trap population of 2.2 million people, half of whom are children. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=145.06s)]
*  You can bicker about the numbers, but many thousands of them are dying, including people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=150.22s)]
*  who obviously if they're children or sometimes when they're not, are not supporters of Hamas, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=153.66s)]
*  don't bear responsibility for what happened. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=158.3s)]
*  It has to be a tragedy for any decent person as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=161.22s)]
*  And I know, I'm sure you look at that with empathy as well. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  So given where we are now, what is your overall view of this conflict between the Gazans and the Israelis? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=167.54s)]
*  Wow, overall view. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=175.66s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the word tragedy definitely comes to mind. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=177.74s)]
*  The images coming out of Gaza are unbearable. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=181.58s)]
*  Of course, like you said, the images coming out of Israel on October 7th, I think really, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=184.74s)]
*  for me and for a lot of people, changed the world in many ways. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=189.54s)]
*  So this overwhelming feeling of tragedy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  But I think that Israel must eradicate Hamas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I don't think that they can allow what happened to stand. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=202.38s)]
*  And to me, the view of a ceasefire, which is what Hamas is asking for, unsurprisingly, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  would allow Hamas to regroup, would allow them that space that they need in order to recover and to continue to exist. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=218.06s)]
*  And I think it would be immoral for Israel to allow the group that perpetrated the massacre of October 7th to continue to exist in that way. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=225.66000000000003s)]
*  And to me, and I'm curious what you make of this, Glenn, the only lens in which Israel has a responsibility [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  to step back and allow Hamas that space to regroup is a very woke lens. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=245.1s)]
*  And by woke, I mean one that replaces an objective sense of what is moral and what is right with a view that the party with less power has an inherent virtue associated with it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=252.58s)]
*  And if that is Hamas, then that is Hamas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=267.1s)]
*  And I think that that is, to me, the only lens that it makes sense to say that we should exceed to the demand of Hamas, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=269.9s)]
*  who is still holding 240 Israelis and Americans and other nationalities hostage and perpetrated that event. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think that that that view that sort of valorizes weakness is the one that people apply when they ask Israel to have suffered October 7th [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=285.58s)]
*  and then just sit back and allow Hamas to continue to exist. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=300.06s)]
*  So I understand that I think you're right that probably some people are looking through it through that prism, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  the prism through which I'm looking at this, though, is the prism of the laws of war, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=311.06s)]
*  which have been developed over several centuries now, but really became very kind of established and clear and formidable in the wake of World War Two, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=316.94s)]
*  when the world looked at the atrocities that drove that war, including the Holocaust, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=327.42s)]
*  but things like mass bombings of Dresden and other places, the use of nuclear weapons, the lack of regard for civilians, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  the intentional bombing of civilians and created a body of rules and laws that were designed to limit what countries can do even when they're fighting a just war. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=339.3s)]
*  And part of those are things like collect about it is a war crime. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  If you try and collectively punish the population, there are restrictions on who what kind of structures you can bomb. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=354.66s)]
*  You can't bomb ambulances or hospitals or schools or places of worship. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=361.42s)]
*  And I understand all the Israeli responses that sometimes those are used by Hamas and all of that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=366.54s)]
*  But do you see whether it's in that body of law, the Geneva Conventions and the Nuremberg trials and all of that, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=373.3s)]
*  any kind of limit on how many people Israel can kill in Gaza in the pursuit of this goal of destroying Hamas? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=382.54s)]
*  It's an extremely important question. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure that it could arrive at a place where I would say I am no longer comfortable with this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=395.14s)]
*  International law does stipulate that if a hospital is being used to launch rockets as a terrorist hotbed, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=401.62s)]
*  as a location that is a military base, that it then forgoes its status as a protected space. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=409.18s)]
*  I believe that there is plenty of evidence that I have personally seen of the IDF doing their best to get civilians out of harm's way. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=418.14s)]
*  They opened up a humanitarian corridor that they were protecting civilians who were leaving from the north to the south, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=427.26000000000005s)]
*  protecting them from Hamas, who was shooting at civilians who were trying to flee because they are their human shields and their protection. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=433.86s)]
*  So I think that from an international law point of view, I feel very convinced that the IDF is doing its best to operate according to those laws. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=441.14000000000004s)]
*  But I have to say, Glenn, international law doesn't mean very much to me. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=450.38000000000005s)]
*  I'm much more of a kind of America first nationalist person. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=455.3s)]
*  I don't believe that international law or human rights are real because not because I don't want them to be, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=459.1s)]
*  but because a right is a contract that you make with a government that can exercise state power against you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  And there is, thank God, no international body that can impose, for example, the laws of the EU, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=473.58000000000004s)]
*  which I'm sure you hate as much as I do because they don't believe in free speech upon us. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=480.3s)]
*  And the tragedy of the Palestinians is that they are stateless, is that there is no government that is [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=484.7s)]
*  answerable to them to protect their civil rights, that in the West Bank, the Israeli government exercises state power against them [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=491.65999999999997s)]
*  without giving them the civil right to vote for that government and that they're living under Hamas dictatorship in Gaza. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  And so to me, I think that if you look at the international law, I feel very convinced that Israel is doing its best to follow it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=504.34s)]
*  But at the same time, I don't know that I put that much stock in it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=512.6999999999999s)]
*  And I have to say that the question to me is this, Glenn, and I'm very curious what you think of this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=517.1s)]
*  It seems to me that to say that if Hamas puts a rocket launcher under a hospital, which it seems like they have, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=523.14s)]
*  and they are actually lobbing rockets at Israeli hospitals, even as we speak, which they are, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=529.3399999999999s)]
*  it cannot be that Israel must allow Hamas to win because it is using its own people in this horrific way. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=535.5s)]
*  And it seems to me that that is kind of the argument that is being made in the name of international law. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=543.7s)]
*  But I'm super curious about what you make of that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=548.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, so I think obviously in the fog of war, every government lies, every side lies. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=550.9000000000001s)]
*  That's part of the that's one of the weapons of propaganda is it's a part of an information war. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=557.3000000000001s)]
*  I have no doubt that there are times that Hamas has used schools and mosques and hospitals. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=562.78s)]
*  We've seen evidence of that to launch rockets or to do other things. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=566.82s)]
*  At the same time, you can go and interview health care workers, surgeons, nurses, people who provide trying to provide care to wounded children, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=570.38s)]
*  to people who are suffering from all kinds of sickness, and they will say adamantly, we want you to come and examine our hospital, investigate our hospital. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=581.58s)]
*  There is no Hamas in our hospital. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=589.14s)]
*  We are trying to take care of hundreds or thousands of patients who are barely clinging to life. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=591.3s)]
*  We don't have anesthesia. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=596.46s)]
*  We don't have food and water to give them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=597.58s)]
*  And we're being told that we have 24 hours to evacuate, which would mean the death of all of our patients. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=600.34s)]
*  And there's no Hamas here. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=605.98s)]
*  So I don't deny that there's that Hamas does those things. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=607.74s)]
*  But I do wonder about the morality of two things. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=614.34s)]
*  One is, if, for example, there was some horrible criminal who we knew had murdered, who was a serial killer, and he took a bunch of hostages, 10 people, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=616.66s)]
*  and he had 10 children or 10 innocent people with him, that's what a hostage is, generally we would not say, well, sorry, we're just going to bomb the place where that person is [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=625.2199999999999s)]
*  and kill those 10 innocent people just to get at the one person that we want to get at, because very quickly the body count for innocent people piles up. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=635.74s)]
*  And then the other thing is, when I'm talking about international law, I don't mean things like the little EU bodies passing judgment. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=645.9s)]
*  I mean things like the Geneva Convention. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=653.38s)]
*  It's like the bedrock of the morality of law that we decided we needed after World War II. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=655.54s)]
*  And so Article 33, for example, of the Fourth Geneva Convention is the one that prohibits collective punishment and says, quote, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  No protected person may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=666.94s)]
*  Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or terrorism are prohibited. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=671.7800000000001s)]
*  And that was in part to ban things like what the Nazis would do, which is that they harbored a single person the Nazis wanted. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=675.9000000000001s)]
*  They would go and kill the entire town or just start randomly shooting people to terrorize them. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=681.82s)]
*  That was collective punishment. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, are you saying that you don't think Israel is bound or should be bound by things like the Geneva Conventions? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=687.9000000000001s)]
*  I it's a good question. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=696.2199999999999s)]
*  I really have lost a lot of respect for these international bodies because of the way that they have been. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=699.02s)]
*  They are used in general. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=705.38s)]
*  There's not anything I could point to in the Geneva Convention that I don't agree with and that I don't think Israel should follow. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=708.4599999999999s)]
*  What is bound by mean? Right, Glenn? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=714.86s)]
*  I think that's the question I'm asking is like who binds them? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=717.2199999999999s)]
*  And I am very glad that there is no one that has the capability to bind them because I think that I believe in sovereignty and I believe in nation states. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=720.38s)]
*  I don't think it's accurate to say that what Israel is doing is collective punishment or to compare it to things that the Nazis did. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=728.26s)]
*  They have given so many warnings. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=734.58s)]
*  They have made millions and millions of phone calls, sent millions and millions of SMS, opened up a humanitarian corridor. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=736.74s)]
*  They have gone. I've never seen anything to this extent. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=743.62s)]
*  I mean, I'm not the most well-read person, but I've never seen an army do this before. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=747.42s)]
*  And I respect people who say it's not enough. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=752.0999999999999s)]
*  You have to let Hamas win because they are hiding amongst civilians. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=755.54s)]
*  I don't accept that as moral. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=761.06s)]
*  And I think what you said on October 9th really resonated with me, Glenn, when you said that morally you just can't compare what Hamas did on 10-7, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=763.26s)]
*  intentionally targeting thousands and thousands of civilians, destroying entire families, all of these atrocities that we've seen with an army doing its best to avoid those civilian casualties, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=774.62s)]
*  really doing its best to avoid civilian casualties. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=789.7s)]
*  And what you're saying, I believe to me, it sounds like when we call that collective punishment, despite every effort that's been made, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=792.14s)]
*  what we're saying essentially is Hamas must be allowed to win because it is willing to sacrifice its own people, the Palestinians. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=802.7s)]
*  And I don't accept that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=811.66s)]
*  I think that those Palestinians also have to be liberated from Hamas and from their dictatorial rule. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=813.46s)]
*  I mean, heaven knows they're brutal to their own people as well. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=819.82s)]
*  And so to me, that is what that means. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=823.34s)]
*  And so like, do I want these children to die? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=826.7s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=831.06s)]
*  But I don't think that you can allow Hamas to win. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=833.14s)]
*  And that's what that would mean. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=837.2199999999999s)]
*  So I think step one is I recognize the effort that the IDF has gone to, which has surprised me, to be honest, the lengths that they went to. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=838.9799999999999s)]
*  And second of all, to say after those lengths, to call that collective punishment is to insist that Hamas has the right to win because it is willing to commit atrocities against its own people. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=847.66s)]
*  And I don't think that's moral. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=858.54s)]
*  So I want to talk about that statement that you referenced on October 9th that I made in explaining why I could never find justification for what Hamas did, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=860.5799999999999s)]
*  no matter how much I might sympathize with the Palestinian cause or believe that the Israeli expansion of settlements and the denial of statehood is immoral. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=869.02s)]
*  That I was basically saying you have to draw a moral line somewhere no matter how much you support a particular cause or just has to be certain things that are over the line. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=878.06s)]
*  And going to a place and seeing a bunch of kids at a music festival or breaking into a house and seeing a family, I mean, there were a lot of people killed that day in Israel. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=887.42s)]
*  We never got real numbers, but a lot of them were in the military, were police forces, people that you would normally think are legitimate targets. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=896.74s)]
*  There are a lot of obviously civilians. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=903.7s)]
*  We saw probably hundreds of them at least that were treated in the most horrific ways. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=905.42s)]
*  And I was saying you have to have a moral line and that has to be over the moral line no matter what the cause. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=909.9s)]
*  My question then becomes for you, do you also agree that there have to be moral lines that Hamas' view is look, we're fighting against this repressive state and so we just need to win. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=915.0999999999999s)]
*  And sorry, if civilians end up dying or we end up having to terrorize the civilian population or kidnap them to protect, to prevent Israel from bombing us because now we have their civilians, we don't recognize the laws of war. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=927.4599999999999s)]
*  We just want to win. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=939.06s)]
*  And one of the things that I think really started disturbing me about what Israel was doing was when the Israeli Defense Minister announced that Israel has been blockading, controlling what gets in and out of Gaza for many, many years. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=940.74s)]
*  They control the airspace, they bomb the airport, no one can leave by plane because Israel bombed the only runway, the only airport in Gaza City. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=952.74s)]
*  They control the sea lanes and they control what gets in and out of Gaza. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=961.3000000000001s)]
*  And the Israeli Defense Minister said, we're going to block food and water and medication from getting into Gaza. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=965.5s)]
*  And when, I don't know if you saw this interview with this American nurse who has spent the last 26 days in Gaza. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=972.02s)]
*  It's incredible if you didn't see it, she was with Anderson Cooper. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=979.0600000000001s)]
*  And she basically said the reason we had to leave was because we were going to die within two days or three days simply from starvation. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=981.86s)]
*  There's no food in Gaza, there's no clean drinking water. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=988.9000000000001s)]
*  She also was being menaced by the population, but she was describing conditions there that seemed very connected to me to what the Defense Minister vowed they were going to do, which was blockade food and water and only a tiny portion of what you need for survival in Gaza is getting in. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=992.58s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1005.5s)]
*  I did say there needs to be more lines for whatever cause you support. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1006.98s)]
*  And so I guess what I'm asking you is what are those lines when it comes to Israel? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1010.9000000000001s)]
*  Like is blockading food and water and preventing that from getting into the entire population over a moral line that you think Israel should observe? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1015.5s)]
*  I was very glad that President Biden and Antony Blinken convinced Israel that that was a mistake and that they reversed course on that. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1025.38s)]
*  I don't know how I would feel if I myself had a family member who was being held hostage, but I wasn't comfortable with that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1034.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think that for me was a red line. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1042.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1043.9s)]
*  So let me just ask you this idea of destroying Hamas. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1045.1s)]
*  I absolutely understand why after every single person I know, Jewish person I know in my life was genuinely traumatized by October 7th. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1048.74s)]
*  Like I know people who are barely political, who don't really haven't really cared much about Israel, who are kind of even critical of it, who just transformed as a result of what they saw on October 7th in a way that made them much more supportive of Israel than ever before. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1058.58s)]
*  And so this idea that we have to go and destroy Hamas, they can't do that. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1073.98s)]
*  You can't have a country when you have armed men coming into your country and doing that to civilians. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1076.78s)]
*  You have to protect your citizens by taking action. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1085.3s)]
*  The idea of destroying Hamas, though, I mean, this is not the first time that Israel has massively bombed Gaza. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1089.3s)]
*  There have been many times nowhere near this scale. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1095.06s)]
*  But back in 2014, many other times, thousands of people in Gaza were killed through sustained bombardment campaigns. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1097.54s)]
*  That was a 51 day bombing campaign. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1103.9s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1106.54s)]
*  Destroy Hamas. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1108.22s)]
*  Like, does it mean kill every person who's currently affiliated with Hamas? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1109.5s)]
*  Because even if you do that, aren't don't you think that on some level, when people in in the West Bank, when people in throughout the Muslim Arab world, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1114.22s)]
*  watch what Israel is doing in the name of destroying Hamas, that it's going to increase the amount of anti-Israel rage and hatred and increase the number of people who want to bring violence to Israel, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1124.7s)]
*  even if this group, quote, Hamas no longer exists, it'll just be done under some other name. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1137.38s)]
*  I don't think that. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1144.6200000000001s)]
*  Let's take the West Bank, for example. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1150.26s)]
*  There's always been this rivalry between Fatah and Hamas in the West Bank. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1153.22s)]
*  I think right now there's this attempt to sort of build up Abu Mazen as an alternative, which is not going to get very far. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1158.58s)]
*  He's deeply unpopular. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1165.22s)]
*  I think there's a lot of anger at Israel. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1168.06s)]
*  But to me, if you take kind of a step just a little bit further back, the Abraham Accords, by and large, are holding, which I think is very surprising as well. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1170.74s)]
*  I really think that President Trump changed the calculation there. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1182.86s)]
*  We do see that the Saudis do still seem interested in normalizing relations with Israel, which I think is a really big deal. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1187.26s)]
*  And one of the reasons that Israel is different from Ukraine and why I think we should be supporting Israel and I don't think we should be supporting Ukraine because of Israel's ability to pull its own weight as an ally and bring something to the table, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1193.6999999999998s)]
*  something like Saudi Arabia. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1210.3s)]
*  And so to me, these Arab countries, they have a look for better or for worse. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1212.26s)]
*  I mean, it's also bad that they have abandoned the Palestinian cause. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1219.7s)]
*  Right. I mean, it's never been more devastating to be Palestinian because these countries that used to be terrified of the Arab street and saying anything that was not like extremely pro-Palestinian, it's clear that the game has changed thanks to President Trump. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1223.58s)]
*  And so to me, what happens the day after in Gaza is an extremely important question. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1239.9s)]
*  How do we ensure the rights of the people there are protected in a way that they haven't been? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1248.02s)]
*  By the way, as I'm sure you've told your audience many times, Bibi Netanyahu was very involved in building up Hamas as an alternative to Fatah because he thought that weakening of Buma's in would force the Palestinian state, the possibility of a Palestinian state. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1253.8600000000001s)]
*  That seems to me to be sort of obviously over. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1270.3000000000002s)]
*  So to me, yeah, I would say killing every last person who was involved in planning and executing this attack, killing the leadership, getting rid of that leadership. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1273.3000000000002s)]
*  And then, I mean, to me, the obvious choice for who would negotiate, who would be the people to negotiate would be the Saudis. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1281.3000000000002s)]
*  That's maybe wishful thinking. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1287.26s)]
*  But thinking about this, you know, for the West, the West, which always uses a kind of racial lens to look everything right, we impose this racial binary onto everything, especially [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1289.26s)]
*  Americans. You know, we see this as Jews versus Palestinians. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1299.78s)]
*  But for the Israelis and for, I think, a lot of the Arab states, this is a much larger. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1303.42s)]
*  This is a sort of an Arab-Israeli conflict. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1308.1399999999999s)]
*  This is about the region. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1310.82s)]
*  And much of the Arab-Israeli part of that was just completely changed with the Abraham Accords. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1312.18s)]
*  And so we're looking at a very different picture. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1319.1s)]
*  It's very hard to say what's going to come. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3PhVWlcMDw&t=1320.62s)]
