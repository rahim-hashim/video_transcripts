# Glenn Reveals the Biggest Challenges of Independent Journalism
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0)
*  Alright, last question comes from Doc Fab who says, Hello, I want to express my gratitude [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=0.0s)]
*  for the work you are doing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=11.86s)]
*  Your fair, detailed, well-documented comments speak to people of many persuasions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=13.6s)]
*  Specifically, my 31-year-old son and I, who is 75, now have many points of agreement ever [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=17.6s)]
*  since he started listening to you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=22.66s)]
*  And we can talk again. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  Because you adhere to your principles, more people can hear what I believe is the truth. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=26.5s)]
*  Many, many thanks for your good work. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=30.66s)]
*  I tell as many people as possible to tune in, and the ones who do are appreciative too. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=31.86s)]
*  Alright, let me just say here, just because that was very, very filled with praise, that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=35.94s)]
*  I don't choose these questions. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=41.3s)]
*  I rely on my colleagues to do so, in part because I want to make sure that I'm not just picking [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=42.5s)]
*  the things that I want to talk about, but things that maybe push me out of my comfort [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=48.82s)]
*  zone. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  So if there's a question that's heaping a lot of praise on me, it's not because I chose [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  it, it's because someone here thought that it raises some important issues. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=55.3s)]
*  I also, I do glance at the questions just to make sure that it's worth speaking about, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  but I don't really read them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  I want to have the first time that I'm really concentrating on them be live on camera so [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=64.7s)]
*  that my answer is more natural and less planned. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  I think that's the point of a Q&A, as opposed to a show where you're sort of more committed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=71.22s)]
*  to an idea ahead of time about what you want to say. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=77.17999999999999s)]
*  But this is probably the type of comment that I appreciate the most, because I just want [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  I want to just be honest for a second about independent media. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=83.54s)]
*  I'm a big fan of independent media. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=85.7s)]
*  I think independent media has become an important alternative to and check against corporate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=88.18s)]
*  media. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=95.34s)]
*  It's provided people the emancipation not to be captive to corporate media, to get their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=96.9s)]
*  information from other sources. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  It's why I came to Rumble, because Rumble, I believe, is one of the very, very, very [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=105.06s)]
*  few companies that has a genuine commitment to free speech, not just branding themselves [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  as such. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=113.42s)]
*  But the problem with independent media is that you don't have funding sources by definition. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=116.14s)]
*  You don't work for a gigantic media corporation the way CNN or ABC News or Fox. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=122.26s)]
*  And typically you don't have big corporate advertisers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  You won't hear, you know, Aetna or Boeing or any major company, Pfizer, advertising [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=132.1s)]
*  on our show or anywhere on Rumble. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  And so people who want to be able to be an independent journalist and make a living out [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=149.1s)]
*  of it have to rely upon the support from their viewers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=155.94s)]
*  And by far the easiest way to do that, the way that's most likely to succeed, and not [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=161.62s)]
*  just succeed but potentially make you quite wealthy, is if you plant your flag in a party [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  or a political movement or an ideology and your viewers know that that's their ideology, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  that's their party, that's their movement, and they're going to come to rally around [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  the flag, whatever that flag is. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  You're never going to tell them anything that upsets them or alienates them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=187.5s)]
*  You're never going to criticize that flag and the movement that the flag represents. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=192.38000000000002s)]
*  And there is a lot of independent media like that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's by far the easiest thing to do. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  You say, I'm on the left, I'm a Democrat, I'm a never Trump conservative, I'm a MAGA [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=204.02s)]
*  person, and then just everything you say and do is aligned with whatever you need to align [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=210.38000000000002s)]
*  yourself with to advance and defend and justify whatever that particular faction is doing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=215.78s)]
*  And it is tempting. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=222.66s)]
*  You look around and you see how many people are succeeding in a very lucrative way by [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=224.06s)]
*  doing that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=231.66s)]
*  I mean, I guess it's tempting to some people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=232.66000000000003s)]
*  It just isn't for me because I think what's so important is I didn't enter journalism [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=237.9s)]
*  because that was my career goal. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  I didn't enter it with any career ideas at all. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  I entered it because I wanted to say things that weren't being said. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=248.17999999999998s)]
*  I wanted them to be heard. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  And as I recounted, I never wanted to attach myself to a party. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=254.54s)]
*  I never wanted to attach myself and be imprisoned by an ideology. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=258.94s)]
*  I most definitely didn't want to have to remain loyal to a particular politician or a set [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=261.9s)]
*  of politicians. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=267.02s)]
*  That sounds so dreary and awful and anti-intellectual and just drained of all of its integrity. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=268.02s)]
*  I'd have no passion doing that whatsoever. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=273.74s)]
*  And so I know that by criticizing Democrats, but then also criticizing conservatives in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=277.74s)]
*  the Trump movement and never just feeding people all the time what they want to hear, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=285.14s)]
*  that does cost you viewers, that costs you supporters, that costs you whatever, it costs [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  you followers on social media. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=293.94s)]
*  It costs everything. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=295.62s)]
*  But I'm not, I think one of the things that is important to me is that, and I'm quite [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=296.62s)]
*  grateful for and aware of, is that I am at a point in my career, I have enough of a platform [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=303.62s)]
*  that I've built up over many years, that I don't really have to worry about losing a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=308.54s)]
*  part of my audience in a way that would make it no longer feasible for me to do this work. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=315.38s)]
*  I'd much rather lose 10 to 15 percent of our audience as we did almost immediately after [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=321.86s)]
*  October 7th in order to be able to pursue the truth as I see it, to present facts that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=325.74s)]
*  I think need to be presented to critique people who I think are not telling the truth, feel [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=332.86s)]
*  good about the work. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=339.98s)]
*  But I realize that not everybody has that luxury. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  Some people can't lose that and continue to do the work. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  So I'm not necessarily judging them, I'm just saying what I feel like I have is a platform [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=348.38s)]
*  that enables me to avoid being captive to those kinds of pressures, that kind of audience [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=353.62s)]
*  captor, the need to just validate everybody's thoughts. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=359.97999999999996s)]
*  And sometimes I think, like, if I don't do it, who's going to do that? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=364.62s)]
*  I mean, there are obviously very big podcasts that don't have an allegiance to a political [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=368.58s)]
*  faction, Joe Rogan being the most obvious example, but Joe Rogan didn't really start [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=373.46s)]
*  as a political podcast and he's not really even now a political podcaster. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=378.38s)]
*  Most of what he does is not about politics. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=383.38s)]
*  Politics is really secondary to what he does. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  And he's gained enough of a credibility with his audience that he can more or less free [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=387.78s)]
*  range on what he really thinks. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=395.06s)]
*  I think he has become more loyal to, more supportive of Trump and the MAGA movement [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=396.9s)]
*  than he had previously been supportive of any one particular faction, but still he's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=403.46s)]
*  very capable of heteroxy, but he's the exception because it's not a political podcast. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=406.94s)]
*  This is a podcast about, or a show about journalism and politics. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=410.74s)]
*  That's obviously what I do pretty much exclusively. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=414.14s)]
*  I don't do a lot of cultural commentary. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=416.14s)]
*  And so the easiest way to do that is to just plant your flag and then validate people's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=418.14s)]
*  views. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=423.42s)]
*  But when I hear a comment like that, like, hey, my son is over here and I'm over here [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=424.42s)]
*  and we have a very difficult time bridging the gap. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=428.98s)]
*  But your show enables us to do that because we can count on you to kind of be reliable [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  and telling us the things that you really think. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=437.82s)]
*  And it's a window into having a more rational conversation than otherwise we might in terms [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=439.58s)]
*  of being super polarized. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=444.54s)]
*  That's the kind of compliment of my work that I feel very grateful for and appreciative [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=446.58s)]
*  of and that I really value because it'd be much easier, much, much easier in my life [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=453.58s)]
*  and in every other way to just feed a group of people exactly what they want to hear. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=459.86s)]
*  It's not hard to do that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=466.3s)]
*  It's very easy. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=467.3s)]
*  You can just put yourself on autopilot and do it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=468.3s)]
*  But one of the things that I'm particularly appreciative of in life is that the work I've [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=471.22s)]
*  always done has been work that I'm passionate about. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=475.42s)]
*  And if I were to do that, I wouldn't be passionate about it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=477.42s)]
*  I wouldn't feel like I have any integrity in it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=479.1s)]
*  I'm not perfect in it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=482.26s)]
*  I'm sure there are sometimes subconsciously where I avoid something or I say something [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=483.5s)]
*  because of that incentive. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=488.06s)]
*  We're all human. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=490.3s)]
*  We all have these incentives. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=491.3s)]
*  But again, it's sort of like the tribalism I was talking about before. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKD9NUIkU0&t=492.3s)]
