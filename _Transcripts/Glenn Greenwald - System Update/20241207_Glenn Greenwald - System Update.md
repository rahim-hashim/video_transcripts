# How This Dog Survived Near Death & Became So Affectionate
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw)
*  Alright, last week we talked about the debut of our new series System Pup Date, which is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=0.0s)]
*  mostly designed to end our week, the last day of our show, which is typically Friday, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=11.24s)]
*  the last episode, the last segment of our show, a few minutes, in a more uplifting way, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=19.48s)]
*  but also the idea of it is that, as you probably know, we have a rescuing dog, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=25.2s)]
*  this is a very important part of my family's life, we've been doing it for a long time, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=32.16s)]
*  we have a huge number of rescue dogs in our house, more than two dozen, and then finally, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=35.24s)]
*  just to avoid becoming completely crazy hoarder family, we opened up a shelter for dogs, so [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=40.76s)]
*  there's about another 150 or 60 dogs there, we've talked about that before, it employs [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  homeless people who live on the streets with their dogs, and one of the things that I've [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=54.24s)]
*  learned over the years is that every time you rescue a dog, it's a completely different [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=59.64s)]
*  experience, the dog is different, the dog reacts differently, the trajectory of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  dog is different, the personality of the dog is different, but also how it affects you [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=67.04s)]
*  is so different, the effect that it has on you, the relationship that it creates between [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=70.2s)]
*  you and your dog is different, and so what we decided to do was highlight each week a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=75.0s)]
*  rescue dog at our house or one at the shelter, and sort of narrate their rescue history and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=80.72s)]
*  what their story is, so last week we started with Sylvester, who's known to a lot of people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=91.24s)]
*  in our after shows, since we always have dogs who serve as co-hosts for our after show, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  and Sylvester did until he passed away just a couple months ago, and this second dog, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  who's also the star of this new episode is Toby, also known to the viewers of our after [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=106.52s)]
*  shows, since he appears there quite frequently, he has a very intense and quite an amazing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  rescue story, and here it is. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=116.8s)]
*  Toby has one of the more interesting rescue stories of almost any dog that we have, it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  was probably 12 or 13 years ago, my husband David, we lived near the woods at the time, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=125.96s)]
*  near this forest, and it was not uncommon to find dogs in the middle of the forest because [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=130.84s)]
*  a lot of people who didn't want dogs or who had a relative who died and they didn't want [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  to take care of their dog would drop them off in the middle of the forest, even though [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=140.64s)]
*  that's the worst place for a dog to be because they can't be found by humans, it's hard for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=143.84s)]
*  them to eat, especially if they're domesticated, but a lot of people do it for the most ignoble [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=149.64s)]
*  reason, which is they think they can do it without anyone seeing them, and so there's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=155.2s)]
*  a lot of dogs that get dropped off there, abandoned, and when David found Toby and brought [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  him home, I've honestly never seen a dog, maybe we had one of the dogs in the many years [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=163.6s)]
*  that we rescued, more emaciated and closer to death than Toby was, I didn't think it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=169.08s)]
*  was possible for a dog to be as emaciated as he was and still be alive, I mean you could [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=174.72s)]
*  see his spine protruding, you could see every single one of his ribs, I mean to say that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=180.28s)]
*  he had no fight on his body is an extreme understatement, he really couldn't walk, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=187.76s)]
*  he was full of every single blood disease, every anemia, every tick and flea disease [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=191.6s)]
*  that's known, I mean he was very close to death, maybe like two days or a day away from [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  dying, and right when David brought him home, I mean that was our big worry, he wasn't going [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=204.4s)]
*  to survive because he was immediately so affectionate, so friendly, he had obviously been around [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  humans before, also he's kind of a weird mixed poodle, so he's a very intelligent dog, they're [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=216.32s)]
*  among the most intelligent breeds and he knew what was going on, he was oriented, he just [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=222.92s)]
*  was so sick, and it was very sad to watch, we had to take him to the vet for all kinds [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=227.56s)]
*  of treatments that were very long term treatments, and I would say it took about six months for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  him to get anywhere near to be a healthy dog, where he could run around, where he could [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=238.94s)]
*  play, where he just was eating a normal diet, where he was off medication, and what's amazing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=244.88s)]
*  is he wasn't even a puppy when we picked him up, he was already an adult dog, maybe like [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=251.88s)]
*  I consider a puppy to be anything from just born to about a year and a half, and he might [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=257.36s)]
*  have been about a year and a half or two years, he was definitely a young adult dog, maybe [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=263.6s)]
*  like an adolescent dog, but he was not a puppy at all, so we don't know exactly how old he [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=267.0s)]
*  was, this was I guess 13 years now, so he's at least 13, probably 14, and he's an incredibly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=271.16s)]
*  healthy dog, and the thing about Toby is that there's, and this is true of a lot of dogs [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=278.92s)]
*  that you rescue who are in the worst conditions possible, is oftentimes when you rescue them [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=283.36s)]
*  and they're in the worst possible situation as he was, he couldn't find any food obviously, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=289.8s)]
*  even if he did eat something, his body couldn't process it, they become the most loyal dogs, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=297.2s)]
*  like the most emotionally connected dogs, the most devoted dogs, I mean look at him, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=302.76s)]
*  just like feel affection, he doesn't immediately love every new human, but for the humans that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=308.24s)]
*  he loves, that he knows, he's I mean about as affectionate of a dog as you can possibly [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=312.44s)]
*  get, he is kind of bullied by the other dogs, he's not a fighter, and the other dogs know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=317.32s)]
*  so it's not uncommon to see him having to hide in a corner or dig out on his back and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=322.28s)]
*  show his stomach, to pretty much every dog, even the weaker ones here, he's the only, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=327.0s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen him bully a dog, he only gets bullied, but every dog here is [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=332.0s)]
*  very accustomed to him because he's one of the older dogs, dogs kind of respect age, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  he's one of those dogs who's just very domestic, he just wants to sleep with you, he just wants [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  to sit with you, and the weird thing about him is, I'm gonna try and show you this, he [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=344.28s)]
*  has one of the most human faces, everybody says this, not just me, not just our family, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=349.4s)]
*  the minute people see him they're like wow, he has very human eyes, I think this shows [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  two important things, number one is that a lot of times when you rescue dogs who are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=359.88s)]
*  actually in not good shape, and you nurse them back to health, and you give them the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=364.2s)]
*  things they need, they know that and they pay back in extra amounts of love and loyalty [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=369.0s)]
*  and affection, the other issue is because he wasn't a puppy, people think oh if you [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=376.12s)]
*  get a dog when they're already adults the connection won't be as strong because they're [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=381.4s)]
*  not with you since puppyhood, this is complete fiction, and one of the problems is that a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=385.6s)]
*  lot of shelters have older dogs, but a lot of times it's very difficult to get them adopted, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=392.6s)]
*  that's true in our shelter as well because people usually want puppies, the thing is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=397.12s)]
*  not everybody is equipped to have a puppy, puppies are a lot of work, you have to train [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=400.64s)]
*  them, they are very destructive, obviously they're adorable, but they will eat anything [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=404.64s)]
*  that is in their way, they'll destroy expensive carpets and furniture, we have a new puppy [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=411.08s)]
*  here and I can't even express how much he's destroyed in his short time here, and that's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=416.32s)]
*  true of every puppy, so a lot of people who want the companionship of a dog but don't [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=421.86s)]
*  really want to have to deal with a lot of problems would actually be way better served [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  by getting an adult dog, and there's this myth that if you get an adult dog they're [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=429.84s)]
*  not going to love you as much or they're somehow not going to be as much a part of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=433.84s)]
*  your life or your story, they're going to have a part of their story that you're never [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=436.67999999999995s)]
*  going to know, that may be true, but adult dogs for a lot of people I would actually [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=440.4s)]
*  recommend that they get adult dogs if they're older, if they don't have a ton of energy [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=445.88s)]
*  to take care of puppies, to train puppies, if they don't know how to train puppies, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  if they don't want to deal with all the destruction, Toby is the perfect example of that, I mean [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  we got him when he was an adult, albeit a young adult, we've had other dogs we've gotten [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  as older adults where we don't even know nearly how old they are, and it's the same thing, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=461.92s)]
*  it's very gratifying to get a dog that was in the shape that he was in, nurse them back [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=465.8s)]
*  to health, and then watch them live this incredibly long and fulfilled life, and that has been [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  Toby's trajectory, it's not always been easy, but he's one of the dogs that just brings [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=476.12s)]
*  out the greatest emotions in you and stimulates this kind of love and compassion and connection [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=480.88s)]
*  that I think only dogs can bring out in people. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqnUPiV6tw&t=486.48s)]
