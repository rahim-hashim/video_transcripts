# ADL *Finally* Speak Out on Discrimination in Hollywood
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4)
*  All right, so we have one last segment to do as I noted at the top of the show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=0.0s)]
*  The Anti-Defamation League is an organization that when mentioned on the show is typically [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=10.32s)]
*  the target of our criticism. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=15.16s)]
*  And tonight we are actually able to heap praise on it and credit because they are launching [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=17.72s)]
*  a campaign to combat a very long-standing systemic and quite notorious problem in the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=23.64s)]
*  United States, which is the inability of American Jews going all the way back to the founding [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=28.44s)]
*  of Hollywood to be able to have any role whatsoever in the entertainment industry. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  As you probably know, when Hollywood was first founded, it was run by a system of studios [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=36.84s)]
*  run by people like Louis B. Mayer and Warner Brothers. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  And there was simply no way for any Jews to ever have any role in any of these studios. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=47.0s)]
*  Once the studio system started declining in the 60s and 70s, the power shifted to agents [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=51.52s)]
*  and then to mega agent firms where American Jews have been notoriously excluded. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=57.18s)]
*  And as well, even on the level of acting, there are virtually no American actors who [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=62.38s)]
*  are Jewish who have ever been able to get any prominent roles. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=67.62s)]
*  And so fortunately, the Anti-Defamation League is using the momentum of October 7th and all [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=71.06s)]
*  of the concern about the crisis of anti-Semitism to finally stand up, finally and demand that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=78.22s)]
*  something be done about the refusal of Hollywood to allow American Jews to play any role in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=85.58s)]
*  the entertainment industry. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=92.46s)]
*  Here is Jonathan Greenblatt, who is the head of the ADL. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=93.46s)]
*  And he tweeted on Wednesday, quote, It's critical for any push for diversity in any industry [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=97.66s)]
*  to be inclusive of Jews. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=105.22s)]
*  If your project of inclusion perpetuates the exclusion of Jews, you are failing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=107.62s)]
*  So we applaud the many celebrities for their courage in standing up, speaking out and writing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=112.18s)]
*  to the academy to demand change. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=116.9s)]
*  Now one of the things we've been trying to get conservatives to understand is that the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=119.58s)]
*  efforts by people like Bill Ackman to get people fired from American universities for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=125.06s)]
*  having supported too broad of a theory of free speech is that they are not trying to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=131.82s)]
*  eliminate the DEI system. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=136.94s)]
*  They're trying to expand it in order to include American Jews, to give American Jews even [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=138.98s)]
*  more privileges within academia than they already have. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=143.3s)]
*  Now like Hollywood, the Ivy League schools are notorious for not allowing American Jews [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=145.7s)]
*  there, for not allowing any American Jews to succeed within academic institutions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=153.22s)]
*  The ADL has been fighting against that too. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=160.26s)]
*  They have this new ally in Bill Ackman. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=161.9s)]
*  That's what the ADL is saying is we like DEI, we like all these diversity programs, we want [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=165.02s)]
*  them expanded though to include the need to include more American Jews, especially now [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  in the entertainment industry where they're notoriously underrepresented. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=176.34s)]
*  And here from the Hollywood Reporter, which is the article the ADL promoted, describes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=180.9s)]
*  what the campaign is. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  From January 9th, you see at the top there's several Jewish celebrities, Julianna Margolis, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  Greg Berlanti, Miriam Billach among the 260 signatories of the letter to Film Academy [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=192.3s)]
*  critiquing Jewish exclusion from diversity standards. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=198.46s)]
*  And you see the sub headline there, quote, an inclusion effort that excludes Jews is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=203.18s)]
*  both seeped in and misunderstands anti-Semitism, reads the letter organized by the Jew in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=206.9s)]
*  City Hollywood Bureau for Jewish Representation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  That's what it says there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's actually the correct formulation, the Jew in the City of Hollywood [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=218.06s)]
*  Bureau for Jewish Representation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=225.14s)]
*  But in any event, the article then says the following, quote, amid Israel's ongoing war [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=226.78s)]
*  with Hamas, Jewish entertainment figures have come together to issue an open letter to the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=233.14s)]
*  Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences criticizing their exclusion from being specified [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  as an underrepresented group. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=243.54s)]
*  Quote, an inclusion effort that excludes Jews is both seeped in and misunderstands anti-Semitism, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  reads the letter organized by the group Jew in the City's Hollywood Bureau for Jewish [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  Representation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=257.02s)]
*  Quote, Jewish people being excluded from the Motion Picture Academy's representation and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=258.02s)]
*  inclusion standards is discriminating against a protected class by invalidating their historic [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=262.94s)]
*  and genetic identity. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=276.06s)]
*  The Academy standards unveiled in 2020 as part of its Aperture 2025 Diversity Initiative [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=278.14s)]
*  describes a number of identities that it considers, quote, underrepresented groups, women, LGBTQ+, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=283.58s)]
*  non-Cognitive or physical difficulties, or being deaf or hard of hearing, as well as [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=290.34s)]
*  underrepresented racial or ethnic groups. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=293.78s)]
*  The standards, which ask productions to submit self-identifying demographic information about [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=296.78s)]
*  its cast and crews in order to qualify for Best Picture Consideration, do not ask for [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=301.9s)]
*  religious status. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=305.82s)]
*  The JITC letter explains that being Jewish is not always a matter of faith. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=307.38s)]
*  Quote, while many mistakenly believe that Judaism is only a religion, Jews are actually [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=311.17999999999995s)]
*  with a varied spiritual practice that not all observe. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=316.38s)]
*  Jews are an indigenous people to the Middle East with a contentious presence there for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=319.62s)]
*  over 3,000 years, said the letter. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=323.38s)]
*  It then went on to complain about things like sometimes there are Jewish characters in films [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=326.5s)]
*  and yet not always Jewish actors are cast to play those roles. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=330.62s)]
*  Sometimes they go to non-Jewish actors and they want to put an end to that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=334.54s)]
*  So this has been one of the great taboos in American life. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=338.02s)]
*  Everybody knows that Hollywood has spent 100 years now just basically operating as [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=342.18s)]
*  a Jewish free zone. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=347.86s)]
*  Americans have no role whatsoever in the entertainment industry. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=349.14s)]
*  They have been aggressively and severely underrepresented. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=351.1s)]
*  It is one of the grave injustices in American political life, just like at Ivy League schools [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=356.26s)]
*  where finally the plight of Jewish students at Harvard and Penn and Yale and the like [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=360.06s)]
*  are being attended to for the first time in many decades. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  And finally there is something being done about the underrepresentation of American [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=370.42s)]
*  Jews in the entertainment industry. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=374.5s)]
*  It is 100 years too late, but thankfully the ADL has taken the lead in that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=376.06s)]
*  They are always at the forefront of the most just causes and we want to recognize the important [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=380.86s)]
*  and noble crusade that they have undertaken because we often criticize them and we think [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=386.06s)]
*  sometimes credit is due where it's due and it's certainly due in this case. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEHQt0NDiu4&t=391.18s)]
