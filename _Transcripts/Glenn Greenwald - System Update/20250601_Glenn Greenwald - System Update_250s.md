# Political Analyst: Israel is Weaponizing Food Against Palestinians
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o)
*  Turning back to Gaza, one of the major stories of this week among just countless horrors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=0.0s)]
*  was this new fake humanitarian aid mechanism that Israel and the US established, the so-called [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=13.8s)]
*  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, forcing Palestinians to walk long distances to the south, hoarding [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=20.36s)]
*  people into cages and scenes reminiscent of the concentration camps of the Nazi holocaust [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=28.2s)]
*  to receive meager amounts of aid, which for many people wasn't even distributed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=33.76s)]
*  You had even one US official appointed to lead this resigning because he felt he couldn't [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=40.4s)]
*  take part in what he said was a violation of humanitarian principles. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  There's been so many revelations coming out about this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=49.8s)]
*  There's the involvement of former CIA officials, including one who trained death squads in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=52.08s)]
*  Central America in the 1980s on behalf of the CIA. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=56.32s)]
*  Israeli politicians have said that the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, is directly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=61.16s)]
*  funding this group. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=64.92s)]
*  What do you make of what has unfolded, and what are Israel's goals, along with the US, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=66.68s)]
*  in setting up this group? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=72.4s)]
*  Israel's goals, I think, on this very rare occasion, we can take Israeli statements of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=75.2s)]
*  which is that the goals are not the provision of humanitarian aid, but rather the weaponization [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=81.64s)]
*  of food and water in order to compel Palestinians who want to survive to concentrate in the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=87.88s)]
*  extreme south of the Gaza Strip alongside the Egyptian border so that Israel can control [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=95.32s)]
*  their caloric intake and can prepare them to be collectively expelled, permanently displaced [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=103.48s)]
*  to Egypt and beyond. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=112.28s)]
*  Israeli leaders have been explicitly clear about this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=115.4s)]
*  Why we're even having a debate about whether Israel is starving Palestinians, whether Israel [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=118.72s)]
*  is seeking to expel them is beyond me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  When an accused murderer pleads guilty in a court of law, you don't have a debate about [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=128.44s)]
*  whether he actually did it or not unless you have confirmed evidence that he's taking the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=132.56s)]
*  rap on someone else's behalf, and that's not the case here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=137.52s)]
*  This organization, entitled the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, I mean Orwell couldn't have come [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=141.76s)]
*  up with a better name. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=147.8s)]
*  As you noted, its head, its director, is this former US mercenary, Jack Wood, who was being [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=150.48s)]
*  exorbitantly paid to lead this sham outfit and resigned because he realized it was going [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=159.56s)]
*  to besmirch his reputation for the rest of his day. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=167.94s)]
*  So imagine an exorbitantly paid mercenary who knew exactly what he was doing decided [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  no longer wanted any part of this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=177.48s)]
*  And the scenes that we saw, of course, are that tens of thousands of Palestinians went [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=180.48s)]
*  to these distribution centers, which are, in my view, deliberately constructed to promote [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=186.12s)]
*  chaos and anarchy as a policy, as a strategy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=192.4s)]
*  But the American mercenaries operating under Israeli supervision are so incompetent that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=197.0s)]
*  they couldn't even manage that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=204.84s)]
*  And one of these distribution centers on the first day was overrun by these desperate [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=206.8s)]
*  crowds. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=211.56s)]
*  The heavily armed US mercenaries managing them had to flee for their lives, and Israel, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=212.56s)]
*  as it always did, opened up with live fire and killed a number of Palestinians and wounded [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=217.4s)]
*  many more. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECLHKm0TH0o&t=222.68s)]
