# Musk/X Officially Targeted by EU for Israel “Hate Speech”
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co)
*  One of the most important trends of 2023 is how many different countries and governments [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=0.0s)]
*  have enacted new laws that give them the power to censor online and to force and coerce big [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=12.18s)]
*  tech platforms upon pain of punishment of law to course in accordance with their agenda, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=19.72s)]
*  with accordance with their dictates. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=26.68s)]
*  We've seen laws enacted in Canada and the UK. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=28.82s)]
*  We've seen laws pending in democracies such as Ireland and Brazil, which we've covered [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=32.62s)]
*  extensively and probably the most pernicious of all those laws is the one that was enacted [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=37.9s)]
*  back in August by the EU called the Digital Services Act, which allows EU regulators to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  fine any social media platform 6% of their overall revenue, not 6% of their profit, 6% [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=49.46s)]
*  of their gross revenue in the event that they find that those platforms are not doing enough [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=56.9s)]
*  to censor what EU regulators regard as disinformation or hate speech. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=61.7s)]
*  You can only imagine, it's not hard to imagine what EU regulators regard as disinformation, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=68.28s)]
*  anything that is contrary to their policies on things like COVID, the war in Ukraine, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=74.42s)]
*  the war in Israel, essentially anything, especially their elections, which they are very desperate [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=80.14s)]
*  to control to ensure that populist governments such as the one governing Hungary, such as [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=85.7s)]
*  the new government in Slovakia where the prime minister who won ran on a platform of cutting [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=91.06s)]
*  off aid to the war in Ukraine to ensure that they can control the outcome of elections [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=100.5s)]
*  That is their primary objective in wanting to censor, but essentially it's to ensure [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=101.5s)]
*  there's no dissent to their policies, to the policies of Brussels, to the policies of EU [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=105.92s)]
*  elites, and they have yet to initiate any formal investigation under this law. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=111.08s)]
*  They've been repeatedly threatening to do so. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=117.32s)]
*  The minute war in Israel between Israel and Gaza broke out, they immediately threatened [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=119.84s)]
*  Twitter, Facebook, and Google that they weren't doing enough to censor anti-Israel content [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=124.64s)]
*  or what they called pro-Hamas propaganda and disinformation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=132.0s)]
*  In other words, they demanded big tech platforms censor more to protect Israel or else be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=134.92s)]
*  punished with massive fines under this new law. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=141.0s)]
*  And today, the EU actually initiated its first formal investigation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=144.28s)]
*  They chose Elon Musk's ex in order to capitalize on how much political opposition there is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=149.4s)]
*  to Musk among the centrist and the left liberals that compose the Western establishment, and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=156.44s)]
*  a must to be to Musk due to the fact that he's refused to censor on command the way [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=164.76s)]
*  the other platforms have, and they know that he's therefore politically vulnerable, and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=168.56s)]
*  they decided to initiate this investigation specifically, explicitly on the ground that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  he's not censoring enough to protect Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  The EU is supporting Israel in its war against Gaza as it usually does, and they decided [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=182.12s)]
*  to exploit this issue as the grounds for saying that Musk is being reckless, in fact, breaking [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  the law by not censoring enough. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=192.96s)]
*  They first exploited this war for these ends five days after the Hamas attack. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=197.22s)]
*  Here was AP on October 12, 2023. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=202.22s)]
*  We reported this at the time as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=205.26s)]
*  EU asks Musk ex for information on hate speech and quote, illegal content related to Israel-Hamas [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=207.94s)]
*  war. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=215.18s)]
*  So they knew as soon as this war broke out, soon as Hamas attacked Israel, that this was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=216.18s)]
*  an excellent opportunity for them to exploit, to claim that they were just trying to protect [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=220.1s)]
*  that they need censorship powers and that they need to punish acts for failing to censor [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=226.06s)]
*  enough to protect Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=230.58s)]
*  They weren't doing it for some left-wing cause. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=231.9s)]
*  They were doing it for a cause that a lot of conservatives support. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, the pro-Israel case is something very important to people across the ideological [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=236.82s)]
*  spectrum, but certainly a lot of people on the Western right and the American right are [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=241.94s)]
*  fanatical supporters of Israel, so they were very clever in implying that they were censoring [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=246.34s)]
*  in order to protect Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=252.58s)]
*  The European Commission on Thursday made a formal legally binding request for information [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  from Elon Musk's social media platform, AXE, over its handling of hate speech, misinformation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=259.18s)]
*  and violent terrorist content related to the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=265.2s)]
*  It is the first step in what could become the EU's inaugural investigation under the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=269.18s)]
*  Digital Services Act. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=274.06s)]
*  In this case, it determined that the site, formerly known as Twitter, is in compliance [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  with the tough new rules meant to keep users safe online and stop the spread of harmful [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=279.28s)]
*  content. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=286.28s)]
*  Don't worry, they're not trying to censor, they're not trying to suppress dissent. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=287.28s)]
*  They're just trying to keep users safe through censorship. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=290.64s)]
*  The conflict is one of the first major tests for the EU's groundbreaking digital rules, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=309.28s)]
*  which took effect in August. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  Breton fired off a similar letter Thursday to TikTok, telling CEO Shozi Chu that he has [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  a quote, particular obligation to protect child and teen users from quote, violent content [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=323.34s)]
*  depicting hostage taking and other graphic videos reportedly making the rounds on the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=328.61999999999995s)]
*  video sharing app. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=333.05999999999995s)]
*  When the EU threatened both TikTok and Twitter, they picked the two most politically polarizing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=335.9s)]
*  platforms knowing that there'd be a lot of people on their side in doing so, Thierry [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  Breton went to Twitter to announce the following quote, the DSA, the Digital Services Act, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  is here to protect both freedom of expression and our democracies, including times of crisis. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=352.5s)]
*  We have sent AXE a formal request for information, a first step in our investigation to determine [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=358.14s)]
*  compliance with the DSA. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=363.34s)]
*  Now even before the enactment of this act, they have been threatening Elon Musk. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=366.58s)]
*  Whenever Elon Musk would say things like, we've freed the bird, meaning we're no longer [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=372.7s)]
*  going to have censorship on Twitter, this French censor on behalf of the EU would come [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=376.52s)]
*  and say the bird will only fly in accordance with our rules. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=381.62s)]
*  They've been telling him for a long time, we in the EU are not going to allow the kind [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=385.29999999999995s)]
*  of free speech that you are vowing to usher in. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=389.54s)]
*  Here is the EU commission, the formal letter they sent on October 12th. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=393.86s)]
*  They didn't even wait a week to exploit the Samos attack. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  Five days into it, they were sending this request. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=402.82000000000005s)]
*  The commission sends requests for information to AXE under the Digital Services Act. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=405.70000000000005s)]
*  Quote, today the European Commission services formally send AXE a request for information [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=409.66s)]
*  under the DSA. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=414.5s)]
*  This request follows indications received by the commission services of the alleged [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=416.12s)]
*  spreading of illegal content and disinformation. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=420.44s)]
*  No, illegal content and disinformation. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=423.16s)]
*  In particular, the spreading of terrorist and violent content and hate speech. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=427.68s)]
*  The request addresses compliance with other provisions of the DSA as well. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=432.6s)]
*  Now this is why I have been spending so much time and so much energy warning people on [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=436.96s)]
*  the right who claim that they support free speech, not to endorse the idea that colleges [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=442.68s)]
*  and American authorities and institutions ought to be censoring in the name of barring [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=449.12s)]
*  terrorist ideas because when you do that, you're going to be handing people like the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=455.6s)]
*  EU and Homeland Security and Canadian officials and British officials and Brazilian officials [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=460.36s)]
*  and Irish officials the weapons to use against you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=467.8s)]
*  They've been using the censorship regime against anti-establishment voices on both the right [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  and the left. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=478.0s)]
*  They will continue to. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=479.0s)]
*  So by suddenly turning around and cheering the censorship regime and the rationale that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=480.8s)]
*  accompanies it, oh, we need to suppress calls for violence against Israel or calls for violence [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  against Jews or terrorist speech, you're fortifying the system. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=490.7s)]
*  You're now using your arguments to justify the censorship regime that they want to impose. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=494.48s)]
*  You think they're going to confine it only to anti-Israel speech. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=500.32s)]
*  They're doing that on purpose to generate more support for it than they would if they [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=504.64000000000004s)]
*  started with a left wing cause. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=508.76s)]
*  But they're going to go right back to censoring the way they've always have been with much [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  stronger weapons in hand as a result of how many people have been demanding this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=515.34s)]
*  Here is Thierry Breton today, December 18th, announcing very proudly, quote, today we [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=520.44s)]
*  open formal infringement proceedings against X. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=526.32s)]
*  And then he lists the alleged violations of the law that X has committed, suspected breach [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=531.36s)]
*  of obligations to counter illegal content and disinformation. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=538.6s)]
*  So they have in mind this idea that they can identify what disinformation is. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=544.72s)]
*  About a month ago, there was an article in the Washington Post about a commission, a [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=550.72s)]
*  study that the EU commissioned that determined that X was also allowing too much pro-Russian [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=554.76s)]
*  disinformation. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=560.9s)]
*  And when we dissected the study, as we did for you, what we found was exactly what we [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=563.32s)]
*  expected to find, which was that the outside company they commissioned to identify, quote, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=568.48s)]
*  disinformation was a group of self-proclaimed disinformation experts funded by the neoliberal [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=573.8s)]
*  billionaire Pierre Omidyar, who's obsessed with Russiagate. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=580.4s)]
*  And by pro-Russia disinformation, all they meant was people who are opposed to the war [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=585.3199999999999s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=590.52s)]
*  They defined it as people whose views align with the Russian government. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  And obviously, if you're against the war in Ukraine, if you're against Western funding [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=595.84s)]
*  of the war in Ukraine, then automatically it means that you are guilty of pro-Russian [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  disinformation. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=604.6s)]
*  And obviously, when they say anti-Israel propaganda or pro-Hamas propaganda, they're going to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=605.6s)]
*  classify that as well as anyone who is opposed to the Western arming and financing of the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=614.4s)]
*  Israeli war. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=621.0s)]
*  Now here is a tweet that Elon Musk posted in response to the announcement from Thierry [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=623.32s)]
*  Breton that the EU is now formally investigating acts for failure to censor enough anti-Israel [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=633.5200000000001s)]
*  material. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=641.1600000000001s)]
*  It was not nearly as defined as you would expect from Elon Musk. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=642.1600000000001s)]
*  There you see it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=644.6400000000001s)]
*  It was, are you taking action against other social media? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=645.6400000000001s)]
*  Because if you have those issues with this platform and none are perfect, the others [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=649.08s)]
*  are much worse. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  Now you can see in this tone of voice that Elon Musk is using, it's very kind of non-confrontational. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  And it's surprising. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=662.58s)]
*  He's speaking to an EU official, the chief censor who's been threatening Twitter for [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=663.58s)]
*  over a year with punishments for not censoring enough. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=669.32s)]
*  And usually, Elon Musk is very defiant. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=672.88s)]
*  Here he's on the defensive. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=675.0200000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=676.6400000000001s)]
*  You see him saying, we're not perfect. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=677.68s)]
*  We know we've not done enough. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=680.4s)]
*  But are you also going to do this against other platforms? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=682.4399999999999s)]
*  Because they're much worse. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=685.3399999999999s)]
*  The reason he's being so defensive is because the accusation here isn't that he's allowing [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=686.4599999999999s)]
*  too much free speech on COVID, or that he's allowing too much free speech on Ukraine, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=691.52s)]
*  or too much free speech on January 6 or Trump or Russiagate, where he would be all defiant [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=698.26s)]
*  and say, will you believe in free speech? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=703.9599999999999s)]
*  No, here they're accusing him of not censoring enough anti-Israel content. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=706.0s)]
*  And he's very sensitive about this. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=711.64s)]
*  Remember, he got accused of being an anti-Semite for weeks, and then he flew to Israel and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=713.0400000000001s)]
*  pledged to Netanyahu all of his support. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  He mouthed and recited almost every pro-Israel bromide as a way of getting out of being accused [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=721.0s)]
*  of anti-Semitism. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=728.48s)]
*  And then he announced new censorship policies on the platform where you weren't allowed [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=731.1s)]
*  to say from the river to the sea or decolonize Israel on the grounds that that's now genocidal. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=735.04s)]
*  He gets very defensive when the accusation is he's not doing enough to protect Israel. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=742.56s)]
*  That was what made this so clever on the part of the EU that they decided to initiate this [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=746.68s)]
*  investigation explicitly by accusing him of not doing enough to protect Israel, hence [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=752.0s)]
*  his defensive posture. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=756.76s)]
*  And it produced headlines like this one from the British Telegraph. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=759.76s)]
*  The US investigation into Elon Musk's acts over Hamas propaganda. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=764.52s)]
*  Can we put the article on the screen? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=768.52s)]
*  There it is. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=771.72s)]
*  The EU launches investigation into Elon Musk's acts over Hamas propaganda. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=772.72s)]
*  The social network is under fire for failing to counter misinformation and violent content. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=777.84s)]
*  So this is the headline they want. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=785.3199999999999s)]
*  This is the framework they want. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=788.68s)]
*  Not that they're charging Elon Musk with failure to censor in order to protect left [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=790.96s)]
*  liberal causes. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=796.32s)]
*  Instead, they're charging him with failure to censor anti-Israel content. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=797.32s)]
*  And what we've seen is there's a lot of support among conservatives in the United States and [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=802.4000000000001s)]
*  in Europe for censorship, for censoring Israel criticisms. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=807.2800000000001s)]
*  We've seen them demanding that on campuses. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  We've seen them demanding that when Ron DeSantis banned a pro-Palestinian student organization [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=814.36s)]
*  from existing in the University of Florida system on the grounds that it gives material [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=819.88s)]
*  support to Hamas, even though it does nothing but express its views. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=825.12s)]
*  There's been a censorship craze over the last two months and much of it has been supported [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=828.6s)]
*  by American conservatives, the very ones who have been claiming to be in favor of free [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=832.6s)]
*  speech for years who would normally denounce the EU. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=838.0s)]
*  But they're framing this as a censorship campaign to protect Israel. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=841.72s)]
*  Quote, the European Commission has opened a formal investigation into Elon Musk's Twitter [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=845.44s)]
*  over its alleged dissemination of misinformation and propaganda related to Hamas. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=849.52s)]
*  The Commission announced that it had launched a full probe into Twitter now known as X to [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=855.64s)]
*  see whether it had broken new EU rules governing online services. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  The investigation is the first under the Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of laws for [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=865.12s)]
*  social networks and search engines, which came into force in August and can impose massive [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=869.54s)]
*  fines on companies seen to break the law. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=874.8199999999999s)]
*  It comes two months after EU internal market commissioner Thierry Breton wrote to Mr. Musk [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  asking him to crack down on quote, the spreading of terrorist and violent content and hate [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  speech on the site. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=888.04s)]
*  It launched a preliminary investigation in October. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=889.4s)]
*  The opening of formal proceedings allows the EU to impose interim measures on X such as [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=892.24s)]
*  changes to its algorithms or stricter monitoring of illegal content. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  Now when they say illegal content, what they mean is anything they deem to be disinformation [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=903.8s)]
*  or hate speech. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=908.4799999999999s)]
*  And we've seen how much that's abused. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=910.56s)]
*  Do you see how grave this is? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=912.56s)]
*  The EU is now able to make changes to X upon pain of having them pay fines that are astronomical. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=914.8s)]
*  That's where the censorship regime has arrived. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=924.12s)]
*  Quote, X has come under fire since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th for failing to counter [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  misinformation and violent content in the social network. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=932.12s)]
*  Mr. Musk himself has been accused of fueling anti-Semitism by endorsing a conspiracy theory [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=935.36s)]
*  and major advertisers have boycotted the service after their adverts were found next to pro-Nazi [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=941.5600000000001s)]
*  material. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=947.28s)]
*  Do you see how this war is being used to justify greater authoritarian powers in the hands [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=948.28s)]
*  of officials all throughout the world? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=953.98s)]
*  Every crisis, every perceived crisis is used this way now. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=958.42s)]
*  Oh, this is too dangerous to allow unfettered speech to thrive. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=962.38s)]
*  COVID in January 6 and Russiagate in the 2020 election and the war in Ukraine all were used [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=968.06s)]
*  to elevate and escalate censorship powers and now they're using this war in Israel to [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=976.0999999999999s)]
*  do so as well only they know that in the West the way to become a popular censorship movement [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=980.26s)]
*  to incur a lot of support from people who otherwise have scorned for e-regulators is [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=986.3s)]
*  to claim that they're doing it, to curb pro-terrorist or pro-Hamas or anti-Israel speech. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=991.9799999999999s)]
*  And there are so many people playing into this in a way that will be extremely self-destructive. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=1000.66s)]
*  The problem is once you cheer a censorship regime once, you lose all credibility to cheer [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=1006.8s)]
*  it in the future when as is inevitable it is turned back against you and the people [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=1012.22s)]
*  who are cheering this are likely going to be the ones paying the biggest price. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7Q1wKp5co&t=1017.26s)]
