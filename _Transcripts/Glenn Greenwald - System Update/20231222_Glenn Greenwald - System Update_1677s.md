# FULL INTERVIEW: Ron Paul & Glenn Greenwald Unravel US Wars, Security State
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY)
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. It's always a pleasure to speak to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=0.0s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=10.32s)]
*  Great to be with you, Glenn. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=12.64s)]
*  So I was thinking today about your legacy in the Republican Party as a longtime congressman [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=14.0s)]
*  in Texas as a two-time presidential candidate. And I was thinking about it as essentially [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=20.32s)]
*  a full frontal assault, a challenge of the various orthodoxies of the Republican Party, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=27.48s)]
*  the longtime orthodoxies on a wide range of issues, certainly including foreign policy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=33.0s)]
*  and the neoconservative wing that dominated Republican politics for a long time. The idea [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=37.52s)]
*  that the U.S. fights too many wars, we pay for the wars of foreign countries way too [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  often when our national interests aren't at stake. To me, it seems like Trump in 2016 [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=47.0s)]
*  picked up on a lot of the ideas that you were actually spreading in 2008 and 2012, at least [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  in terms of the campaign promises he made. And I'm wondering as you look at today's Republican [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=58.68s)]
*  Party, how much progress do you think has actually been made in moving away from neoconservatism [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=63.24s)]
*  to a more anti-interventionist foreign policy? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=71.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think there has been an advancement because I talk about the difference between [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=75.08s)]
*  what it was like when I first went to Washington. It was the money issue of 1971 and closing of the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=80.92s)]
*  gold window. That's what I think got me interested in Austrian economics. So I was first elected in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=87.64s)]
*  76 and I now look back sometimes and they'll ask similar questions and they'll want me to compare [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=93.08s)]
*  it. And I think there's a big difference because when I first went in, nobody was talking about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=98.76s)]
*  Austrian economics. Libertarianism was barely mentioned and there was essentially, you know, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=106.44s)]
*  there wasn't a Mises Institute that was leading the charge on Austrian economics. So I would say [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=114.52s)]
*  there's great growth, but when people say, and you know, when I come down on the side of, I want to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=121.16s)]
*  be optimistic, the Glenn Greenwalds are around, they're coming alive, you know, and I think this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=126.6s)]
*  is just great. But others, typical Republicans, say, yeah, but it's a mess and all this stuff and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=132.28s)]
*  they're very negative. But Leonard Reed, the founder of the Foundation for Economic Education, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=139.88s)]
*  did a lot to help me understand this. He says it's not a numbers game. It's not a numbers game at all. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=146.2s)]
*  You know, eventually you need attitudes, prevailing attitudes, but it's you don't convert 51% of the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=152.28s)]
*  people. What you want is to look for special people who are willing to stand up at a PTA meeting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=160.2s)]
*  and say what everybody else is thinking. So the leadership issue is this thing. And I think that's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  where we're making progress. I think there's a better understanding of Austrian economics. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  There's going to be a great necessity and there is right now. I think more people say, own gold [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=177.64s)]
*  than today wanting to protect themselves than say in 1933 when the gold was confiscated and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=183.4s)]
*  nobody really cared that much. So I think there's a lot of progress, but a lot of as much as I like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  see that progress, I still think we live in very, very dangerous times. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=196.68s)]
*  Absolutely. You know, I think when people think about your presidential campaign and people go [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=201.0s)]
*  back and look at the debate, it's really remarkable the extent to which you were isolated [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  on that stage with candidates like Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, these very conventional [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=210.28s)]
*  Republicans and the lobbyists who filled those debate halls would do what you were saying on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=215.24s)]
*  things like the Iraq war and 9-11. And yet you did much better than I think people expected. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=220.12s)]
*  And you were going into very red districts in places like Iowa and South Carolina, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  not just with libertarian economics, but also with this foreign policy message that the time was not [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  very popular in the elite class, that we were fighting too many wars under the name of the war [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  on terror, that it was costing ordinary Americans a huge amount of their resources and quality of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=240.68s)]
*  life because how much we were enriching arms industry for all these wars that weren't in our [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=247.4s)]
*  interest, including obviously the rock war, but so many other. Did you find that ordinary Republican [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=253.32s)]
*  voters in these deep red places were more receptive to that message than you had anticipated or [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=259.0s)]
*  what was the reaction when you started kind of in vain against neoconservatism that at the time [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=265.8s)]
*  was dominant in the Republican Party under Bush and Cheney? I see it in two groups and I say, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=271.24s)]
*  if you're talking about the chamber of commerce, no, I wasn't cutting into that. But amazingly [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=277.56s)]
*  enough, I felt optimistic about going to the liberal universities, where the young people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=283.16s)]
*  came out and they figured that they were radical left, they were illicit, and they were much more [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=291.48s)]
*  open-minded. So I was encouraged by that. But when the conventional Republicans would come up to me [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=297.88s)]
*  and they say, well, we're going to do this, and that was early on, they thought they should just [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=303.88s)]
*  threaten me to behave and that sort of thing. I said, well, I want to do a comparison. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  You have a, you know, we have a constitution, you take an oath to it, but I didn't put the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=314.04s)]
*  pressure on them there, which I would, but not necessarily. But what I would do is take out their [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=318.76s)]
*  document, the platform, and I said, I'll contest you because the Republican platforms sometimes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=326.68s)]
*  had some good stuff in it. And I said, why don't you compare the votes on that? The war issue was a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=332.84s)]
*  big issue. And I think what I tried to work on is they made it so that if you didn't go along with [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=340.52s)]
*  all that evil, you were unpatriotic. And that's what they played on. And I think we sort of cut [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  into that. I remember the time when it was on a debate, the Giuliani type thing, they would say, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=357.96s)]
*  oh, you know, you don't support the troops and all this stuff. Yeah, it just happened. I was [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=363.88s)]
*  drafted and served five years in the military. I was collecting more money from the military than [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=369.0s)]
*  they were. So I think that resonated that people loved that stuff because they hadn't heard it [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=375.24s)]
*  before. So I think I changed that a little bit that if you don't vote for even now, the NDAA, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=381.24s)]
*  the vote there is, is we used to get on that kind of stuff. If we got 10 or 12 votes, it was a big [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=389.08s)]
*  deal. Now there's an argument going on. Maybe we shouldn't send more money to Ukraine. Maybe we [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=395.88s)]
*  should think about protecting our borders. Maybe we should spend that at home, this sort of thing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  So the attitude, I think, has changed. But I still think the big issue when it comes to our policies [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=408.04s)]
*  and all is the fact that the debt is too big, malinvestment is horrendous. We have invaded so [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=414.52s)]
*  many countries. We have an empire that's going bankrupt, losing credibility. I believe that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=422.36s)]
*  nothing happens until it's liquidated. And then there's a reestablishment or a rebirth of the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  energy. And I see the rebirth coming and the enthusiasm, but we still have a way, a ways to go. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=434.2s)]
*  And that to me is what we have to keep working on because I believe there's a sentiment out there. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  I think people, when I started talking about nihilism and telling the truth all the time, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=448.68s)]
*  and these people, they live by telling lies. I think most decent people want to hear that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=456.36s)]
*  And sometimes they need a little encouragement, but sometimes the people who get to express [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=462.76s)]
*  themselves on the media, and you know all about journalism and what you have to go through. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=468.04s)]
*  If you had 50 people that you might have come along with in journalism, you and two other ones [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=474.35999999999996s)]
*  might be the ones telling the truth, but you might be the only ones that people really respect. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=481.0s)]
*  The other ones, they have to sell their soul in order to make a living. So to me, the numbers are [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  not the game. It's speaking the truth, and there's an audience out there. So that's the reason I'm [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  encouraged. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure you saw this controversy recently where people rediscovered the Osama Bin Laden [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=498.44s)]
*  letter to Americans in 2002 explaining that the reason Al-Qaeda attacked the United States, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=505.0s)]
*  the reason there was so much anti-American sentiment wasn't because they hated us for [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  our freedoms, but because they hated that we were bombing their countries and imposing dictatorships. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=515.16s)]
*  And there was a lot of pressure. TikTok had to ban any discussion of that letter. They didn't [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=520.04s)]
*  want people reading that. And I remember you having that kind of exchange with Giuliani and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=524.28s)]
*  the other Republicans on the stage where you were trying to say, look, if we go around the world with [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  these wars, we're going to pay a cost. People are going to want to attack us back like on 9-11. And [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=532.68s)]
*  that was a taboo subject. You were accused of being pro-terrorist and justifying 9-11. And it was just [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=537.64s)]
*  funny that there was this recent controversy where people discovered the Bin Laden letter. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=544.92s)]
*  Let me ask you about a couple of the wars that we're actually fighting now that you alluded to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  one in Ukraine. Before I get to that, I want to ask you about the one in Israel because this is [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=552.28s)]
*  a country, Israel, that has received more foreign aid from the United States over the last several [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=558.12s)]
*  decades than any country by far, even though American generals often say that it endangers our [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=562.8399999999999s)]
*  national interests to be so tied to Israel and the region, given what they're doing to the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=569.88s)]
*  Palestinians. The minute the war started, Biden depleted our own stockpile and sent all kinds of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=573.48s)]
*  weapons that Israel wanted, asked for another $14 billion in aid to Israel on top of the billions [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=579.4s)]
*  of dollars we give them every year. And other than a couple of members of Congress and the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=585.16s)]
*  Republican Party, there's really no opposition at all to this attempt to pay for yet another [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=589.16s)]
*  Israeli war with American resources. What do you make of this new war in Israel and Gaza and of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=595.88s)]
*  Biden's posture toward Israel and saying, whatever you need, we're here to give it to you? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=602.28s)]
*  Well, I think we've made some inroads because the debate is a little bit different and people [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=606.52s)]
*  are starting to say we shouldn't keep sending it to them. And it always ends. Our side always wins, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=614.04s)]
*  but it's painful because the runaway inflation and debt ends. The markets are powerful and they end [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=619.72s)]
*  and it's tragic because a lot of innocent people suffer. But all this ends and then the empire ends [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=627.4s)]
*  and the people know this. But the one thing is, we, I as a libertarian, have an easy way to answer [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=635.08s)]
*  when you talk about that war. Well, what should you do? Should you veto the peace and the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=645.4000000000001s)]
*  resolution of the UN? Should you send war help to the Palestinians or should you [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=652.12s)]
*  help Israel? They end up helping everybody. And of course, our approach is, well, we got ourselves [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=660.0400000000001s)]
*  into that. And Ben Laden was very explicit about that. He listed three things. It was the bombing, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=668.5200000000001s)]
*  it was the Palestinians, and it was having troops in Saudi Arabia. And I would use that as the reason [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=676.6s)]
*  and actually that blowback principle, I was able to quote the CIA. They're the ones who originally [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=684.76s)]
*  brought the term up. They said, you know, there'll be blowback. But then when they found out that it [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=691.3199999999999s)]
*  wasn't popular to say that, there were only a few of us that were then speaking out, you know, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=696.6s)]
*  and saying there is an explanation. What made me upset about that whole mess and continue to do, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=704.04s)]
*  whether it's Ukraine or whatever, they don't ask, you know, why did they do it? You brought this [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=710.84s)]
*  question up. Why did we do this, you know, with Israel and others? Why do we send it? What's the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=717.32s)]
*  motivation? And Ben Laden is a motivation, but they never asked that question. Why did the terrorists [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=727.48s)]
*  bomb us? And what happens if somebody gets murdered or there's riots and all these things? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=734.12s)]
*  Who killed whom? They'll dissect it out on social terms and they'll ask who did this, who did this, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=740.44s)]
*  and see if they can politicize it. But they'll ask who did it and why did they do it? There's always [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=746.2s)]
*  one looking for a motive, but they did not ask for a motive. And you brought up the subject. Well, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=751.08s)]
*  they should, you know, we should talk about motives because that's how governments get away with this. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  And it's easy to control the people if they have, you know, access to the people who are in charge [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=763.4s)]
*  of the media. And you understand that very well how you can influence people. But, you know, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=770.76s)]
*  I understand the frustration, but I also understand that when I run into a Glenn Greenwald, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=776.76s)]
*  I'm excited about it because our message is getting out there. At least not that we would [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=784.92s)]
*  agree on everything, but stop and think about it. And that's where the problem is. And that's where [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=790.84s)]
*  I think the hope is. It's also the reason I stay involved in education. I have, you know, a small [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=797.64s)]
*  effort in my homeschooling, but we reach a lot of people interested in finding out the truth. I think [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=804.44s)]
*  that's the mandate that we have. We have to do our best. If you want to pay any attention or [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=810.52s)]
*  contribute anything, you have to be willing to search for and find out what the truth is all about. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=816.44s)]
*  Absolutely. You know, it's interesting. As soon as the war in Eastern Europe broke out with the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=824.12s)]
*  Russian conflict with Ukraine, it was very interesting to me that the only opposition [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=829.1600000000001s)]
*  to funding the war in Ukraine, the way Joe Biden immediately said he wanted to do with NATO, did [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=835.1600000000001s)]
*  come from parts of the Republican Party that have become more anti-interventionist. I interviewed a [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=839.32s)]
*  lot of members of the Republican Congress over the last couple of years where only not one Democrat [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=844.92s)]
*  voted no. Every Democrat from AOC and Ilyin Omar to Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer and everyone in [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=850.36s)]
*  between were yes, let's fund the war in Ukraine. But the no votes came from this anti-interventionist [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=856.68s)]
*  wing in the Republican Party. And I did look at that as progress. And I did look at that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=861.88s)]
*  as kind of a legacy of, in part at least, your efforts in the Republican Party. And I would talk [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=866.4399999999999s)]
*  to them and they would say things like, look, we have too many problems at home. We have too much [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=872.52s)]
*  national debt. We can't afford to fund the wars of foreign countries. They would say Ukraine is not [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=877.3199999999999s)]
*  the 51st American state. This isn't our war. And every time they would say that to me, Congressman, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=883.72s)]
*  right, and this was before the Hamas attack, I would say, well, does that same rationale apply [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=889.24s)]
*  to Israel? In other words, it's great to hear you saying we shouldn't be funding Ukraine's wars. We [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=894.04s)]
*  have too many problems at home. Do you say that for Israel as well? And they would immediately [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=899.32s)]
*  start stumbling and looking for reasons why Israel was different. Why do you think that so [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=903.8000000000001s)]
*  many Republicans, even the ones willing to stand up on Ukraine, are not willing to do the same when [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=909.4000000000001s)]
*  it comes to questioning why we fund Israel's wars? Well, I think it's an atmosphere. It's an attitude. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=914.6s)]
*  It's been around for a long time because who's controlling the message? Because if you say [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=923.64s)]
*  something that's not like, I'm not ever going to vote for foreign aid for Israel. Well, that's [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitic and you're a monster then. But if you say the best way to solve this, you don't send [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=938.68s)]
*  money to either side. You don't send money to the Palestinians. You don't send money. You don't have [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=945.96s)]
*  an empire. It amazes me how many times have some American military units been hit in the last couple [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=951.8s)]
*  of months. Is it over like over a hundred times? And people are saying they're bombing Americans [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=961.9599999999999s)]
*  and we have to do more. When I was trying to stop the march to war in the Middle East under Bush, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=967.0s)]
*  I made them to vote on a declaration of war just to put it on record. I said, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=976.76s)]
*  if you guys want war, you have to have to vote for it. And boy, I was on the committee for that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=981.9599999999999s)]
*  And boy, did they hit me hard on that. They said, they've been attacking us. I said, you have to [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=987.7199999999999s)]
*  have an aggression against us. They have been. They've been shooting at our airplanes. Our [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=995.0799999999999s)]
*  airplanes are flying over Iraq bombing. And they decided that was aggression against America. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1002.2s)]
*  And it just fly by. So total ignorance. And that's why we need to keep working on building the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1007.88s)]
*  people who are sending the message out. And we need to cultivate a lot more good journalists. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1019.5600000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you that. Absolutely. Yeah. I think it's so interesting. We hear in these news reports, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1025.8s)]
*  oh, American bases in Syria, in Iraq have been attacked again with the flare up in the region. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1031.08s)]
*  And I think a lot of people say, wait, we have military bases in Syria and Iraq still. Why do [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1036.92s)]
*  we have those there? And when did Congress approve those? It's just such a kind of normalized part of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1042.28s)]
*  our discourse that we just have troops in essentially every country. One of the other [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1047.8799999999999s)]
*  challenges that you frequently defended in challenging Republican orthodoxy was on civil [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1053.16s)]
*  liberties as well. And I think it's very clear that there's more space than ever in the Republican [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1059.16s)]
*  Party to do things like harbor skepticism for the CIA and the FBI and Homeland Security, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  especially the ways in which they interfere in our domestic politics, spying on our American [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1070.8400000000001s)]
*  citizens, the NSA for sure. Do you think that that newfound skepticism in the Republican Party [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1076.2s)]
*  is due to the fact that those agencies seem to have targeted President Trump and tried to [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1084.04s)]
*  undermine his presidency? Or do you think there's a more principled awakening on the part of parts [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1089.1599999999999s)]
*  of the American right about how pernicious and dangerous these agencies are when unleashed on [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1094.28s)]
*  our own citizenry? Yeah, I think it's always been both. It has been less genuine until recently. I [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1099.24s)]
*  think it's getting that way. I get a chuckle out of a unit while they're deciding on whether the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1109.08s)]
*  president or Trump is allowed to be on the ballot. And every once in a while, you'll get a Democrat [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1116.12s)]
*  that doesn't fall in line and he has the right answer. He says, you know that you do it against [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1124.76s)]
*  us too. They're starting to look at it. And not that they've come to a good position, but they're [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1130.04s)]
*  getting to see if this goes on, it's going to spread and make it worse. When 9-11 occurred, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1135.4s)]
*  it was within hours they started talking about the Patriot Act. And within a day or two, they [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1144.52s)]
*  had it on the floor. And there was essentially really no debate at all. It had been written [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1149.96s)]
*  a while back. And there was somebody sitting beside me and a friend who frequently would vote [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1156.92s)]
*  with me. And he was voting no and yes. And I was voting no. I said, were you voting yes? Were you [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1165.8000000000002s)]
*  no that this is bad? He says, yes. But how am I going to go home after 9-11 and tell my constituents [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1173.16s)]
*  that I voted against the Patriot Act? And he just threw up his hands. He surrendered to it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1183.4s)]
*  And all I did tell him, I said, well, that's your job. Go back home and explain it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1191.64s)]
*  Yeah. You represented a not exactly left-wing district in Texas and managed to keep going back [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1196.6s)]
*  and getting re-elected even while you were taking these positions so contrary in so many ways to [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1202.28s)]
*  Republican Party orthodoxy. Another area where you did that is the war on drugs and the general [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1208.4399999999998s)]
*  idea that we are imprisoning more of our population than any other country in the world. And you know, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1217.08s)]
*  it's so funny how often perceptions are distorted because of the media. So it was actually Joe Biden [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1224.04s)]
*  who probably more than anybody in the Senate played a leading role in kind of constructing [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1230.9199999999998s)]
*  the legal architecture that led to the war on drugs, people being incarcerated in huge numbers [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1236.2s)]
*  for possessing drugs, including just the prison industrial system in general. And it was Donald [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1242.28s)]
*  Trump who signed one of the first criminal justice reform bills in many, many years. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1248.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering whether you think with rising crime rates in our cities and the perception that our [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1253.64s)]
*  cities are falling apart, that there's still potential progress that can be made in reducing [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1259.0800000000002s)]
*  some of these laws that are just still imprisoning American citizens en masse and what kind of work [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1265.64s)]
*  is still needed on those issues? Well, they're still working on it and they pick different drugs [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1271.72s)]
*  to accuse them of and fentanyl. Fentanyl is a little bit harder to defend. They just make it legal [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1277.4s)]
*  and because marijuana is legal now and for the most part and that has [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1285.72s)]
*  made it so people didn't have to kill people each other. But fentanyl is a little touchier subject, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1294.44s)]
*  but I think you apply all those rules together and it's trying to compare it to that. I said, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1300.44s)]
*  how many, and I found some articles and I don't know how accurate this is, but the principle is [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1307.56s)]
*  more people die from alcohol and related diseases and accidents than they do from fentanyl. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1313.88s)]
*  So if I tell people that, I said, do you want to go back to prohibition? Oh no, we don't mean that [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1320.44s)]
*  because 92% of the, I don't know what the process is, a lot of people in Congress drink alcohol. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1328.28s)]
*  They're not going to change that, but I think it's a job, but I think you're going to apply [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1339.56s)]
*  the same rules to all of it because everything is dangerous. You might put it up to a [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1346.12s)]
*  conservative that wants to regulate the drugs and yet you say, well, do you think a lot of people [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1356.1999999999998s)]
*  died? But the liberals tell us a lot of people die unnecessarily with guns. I said, why don't we [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1362.9199999999998s)]
*  regulate these guns and do something about the guns? Oh no, that's different. Early on we had a [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1370.28s)]
*  debate and I was debating in a friendly way a very liberal congressman from Texas and he was [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1379.72s)]
*  against the reintroduction of registration for the military and I voted with him, which [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1386.76s)]
*  people hadn't figured me out yet and he was still so amazed about this because I made a statement. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1394.28s)]
*  I said, why are you guys, my conservative Republican friends, why do you want to register people? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1402.04s)]
*  You won't even register your guns. So this liberal came up and he says, boy, I wish I had thought of [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1408.12s)]
*  that one. Yeah, yeah, sometimes it just takes confronting people with their principles and it is hard to get [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1414.2s)]
*  people to reconcile those. I have a couple more questions since the limited time that we have. I [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1421.96s)]
*  want to respect your time. I want to ask you about China because I do have a lot of conservative [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1425.88s)]
*  friends, people who come to my show. We have a lot of agreement. They seem to have a really [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1431.88s)]
*  anti-interventionist perspective now. They don't think the United States should be fighting as [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1436.44s)]
*  many wars, but there's always one country that the security state can feed people and say, no, this is [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1440.92s)]
*  the really dangerous country and I think there is still a perception on the part of a lot of [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1446.28s)]
*  conservatives that even though a lot of these countries we're presented with like Russia aren't [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1450.6s)]
*  real threats, China is a real threat to the United States and maybe we need to have a Cold War, even [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1455.7199999999998s)]
*  a hot war over Taiwan. What is your view of the proper relationship between the United States and [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1461.0s)]
*  China? Do we see them as an enemy, a competitor, a potential trading partner? How do you see the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1467.24s)]
*  U.S. planar relationship? Well, I think the hawk Republicans are a little bit confused on this [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1472.36s)]
*  because it is true. China is a competitor and we ought to watch them because they're taking our [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1480.9199999999998s)]
*  dollars and they're investing them overseas. They're better investors than we are. What do we do? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1485.4799999999998s)]
*  We spend it all on the military and go around the world and we're going broke and they go and they [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1491.56s)]
*  invest overseas and then our people complain a whole lot. Oh, you know, they have control of this [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1498.28s)]
*  and this and this. No, I think it's way too much China bashing. I was in high school during the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1502.92s)]
*  time the Korean War was going on. I was drafted during the Vietnam War and the Korean War was [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1510.12s)]
*  just, you know, never made any sense to me and yet that was one of the big things that they had, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1517.56s)]
*  the Korean War. It was terrible because one of my teachers got redrafted, went over there and got [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1525.08s)]
*  killed. That was part of my growing up about this issue. But the Korean War, what I want to say about [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1536.04s)]
*  that was it brought to light Nixon and that bad guy Kissinger. And now there's, you know, all this [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1544.52s)]
*  and any chance they can bash China, they do. But China is very competitive and how did they get all [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1554.44s)]
*  our money? Well, we failed to satisfy our consumers at the right price for the right product. So we all [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1564.6000000000001s)]
*  went and bought all this stuff from China and then they turned it around and say it's all China's [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1572.0400000000002s)]
*  fault. So it's just a gimmick and China is far from angels. I think as Rand has pointed out that [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1577.72s)]
*  they're probably guilty of messing around with viruses and all this stuff. But I think what Nixon [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1587.88s)]
*  did by going over there, that was a big event, I'll tell you, when it was nothing but war and killing [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1594.44s)]
*  and all this stuff. And we had an opportunity, it's sort of like the opportunity we had when [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1602.6799999999998s)]
*  the Cold War ended with Russia and the Soviets. And we blew that even though there's still remnants [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1607.48s)]
*  of the benefits from this. But there was, I think, tremendous benefits by opening up the door with [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1614.52s)]
*  China because I strongly believe what the founders believe, that if you trade with people and travel [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1622.12s)]
*  with people and share ideas, you're much better off and you're much less likely to start a shooting [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1627.8s)]
*  war. And right now we're moving in the direction that some people would like to. I mean, with Taiwan, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1633.72s)]
*  people want to bomb them already. Does that make sure they never attack Taiwan? Well, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1640.44s)]
*  you know, that doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFz3pbnzwY&t=1647.0s)]
