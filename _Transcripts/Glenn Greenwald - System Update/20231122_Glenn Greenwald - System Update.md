# Orwellian Morning Joe "Redefines Success" in Ukraineâ€”Erasing Their Warmongering | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU)
*  There was no way Ukraine was going to beat Russia without the deployment of NATO troops [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=0.0s)]
*  into that war, which could never have happened because that would have been World War III [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=12.32s)]
*  with the new core in power. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=15.36s)]
*  And those of us who said it at the time and who said this war is going to produce no good, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=18.12s)]
*  it's not defending Ukrainians, it's destroying Ukraine and sacrificing Ukrainians at the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=21.48s)]
*  altar of the real American goal, which is to weaken Russia, were called Russian agents, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=28.2s)]
*  were called Putin apologists, and we lost that debate because the media always succeeds [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=32.44s)]
*  in getting majorities of Americans on the side of whatever new shiny war they present. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=40.92s)]
*  Yeah, forget about Iraq, forget about Libya, forget about Syria, forget about Vietnam. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=45.32s)]
*  All the times we lied to you, all the times we told you things were going to happen that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=50.96s)]
*  didn't happen, forget about all that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=53.84s)]
*  We have a new war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=55.04s)]
*  This one's the real deal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=56.04s)]
*  This time we're really on the right, the good side. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  This one's different. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=62.32s)]
*  And every time it turns out not to be. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=64.88s)]
*  And then we get to the end, and if we had a healthy country, we would have a lot of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=68.32s)]
*  politicians in Washington, a lot of people in the media standing up and saying, over [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=72.0s)]
*  here, hold me accountable. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm to blame. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  I made a mistake. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  I was wrong. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  Fire me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=82.52s)]
*  Scorn me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=83.52s)]
*  Put me out of office. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=84.72s)]
*  Obviously that doesn't happen. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=86.92s)]
*  They all unite and pretend that they never said or did any of the things that they're [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=89.28s)]
*  ashamed of. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=93.6s)]
*  And because they unite and all protect each other and no one gets held accountable, they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=94.8s)]
*  all get to move on to the next war and do the same thing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Now it's been clear for a while that the US and NATO were going to have to abandon Ukraine, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  in part because the touted counteroffensive, this vaunted Ukrainian move against Russia [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=110.64s)]
*  went nowhere. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  It was a debacle. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  They barely made any inroads or encroachments into the Russian defensive line. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  They barely moved the front line, and yet they lost enormous amounts of military equipment [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=124.8s)]
*  and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian lives, which they don't even have anymore to give. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=129.4s)]
*  They're pulling men in their 40s and 50s off buses and sending them to the front line. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=137.16s)]
*  They don't have men to fight anymore. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=140.68s)]
*  It's an all conscript army. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=144.6s)]
*  People are desperate to get out of the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  They're fleeing and paying money to leave because they know they're being used as cannon fodder. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=147.56s)]
*  And the fact that we now have a new war in Israel that we have to pay for, Biden already [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=154.04s)]
*  said $14 billion, which of course will be nowhere near enough, a war that we care a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  lot about a lot more, at least right now, than we do the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=168.84s)]
*  It was already clear the war in Ukraine had to come to an end. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=173.36s)]
*  And now that we have a new war to pay for and to arm and fund and talk about, no one [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=175.6s)]
*  cares about this war anymore and everyone is ready to throw Zelensky to the side. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=180.04s)]
*  Here is Morning Joe this morning in or yesterday rather on Monday morning saying the sort of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=186.12s)]
*  things that if anyone said three months ago, these very people would have instantly branded [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=195.4s)]
*  them Russian agents. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=199.76s)]
*  Listen to this conversation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=201.16s)]
*  And Aidan's done an extraordinary job. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=202.16s)]
*  How much longer do we continue pushing? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=205.78s)]
*  I think what many people in Pentagon would think is the unrealistic goal of Ukraine driving [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=212.16s)]
*  every last Russian out of their country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=219.28s)]
*  If you would, I promise you, if you said six months ago what Joe Scarbo said yesterday, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=223.96s)]
*  that it's unrealistic to think that Ukraine can drive every Russian troop out of Ukrainian [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=231.6s)]
*  soil, they would have tried to destroy your reputation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=236.64s)]
*  They absolutely would have called you a Putin apologist, an appeaser, a Kremlin agent. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=240.52s)]
*  But now that they know that Joe Biden's hands are tied, that he can no longer fund this [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  war in Ukraine, that nor can the EU. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  And even if they did, it isn't going to move this line. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  There's no more Ukrainians to fight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=257.8s)]
*  There's no more money to give them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  There's no more artillery to give them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=261.64s)]
*  There's no other way to make up the shortage against Russia. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=263.12s)]
*  Now that they know that Biden is going to lead Zelensky to the peace table, to the negotiating [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=267.0s)]
*  table to forge a peace deal that involves having Russians keep control over Ukraine, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=272.92s)]
*  now he's saying, of course it's not realistic to drive every Russian out of Ukraine. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=278.2s)]
*  That was so obvious from the beginning, and these people insisted that was the only outcome [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=285.2s)]
*  that you could talk about. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=289.44s)]
*  It was never any more realistic back in February of last year or January of this year or April [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=292.32s)]
*  of this year than it is now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=298.38s)]
*  Do you see how they give themselves permission to just completely change the rules of discourse [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  while pretending they're not doing it? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  Question, Joe, in what country? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=310.08s)]
*  It's exactly the right... [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=314.2s)]
*  Every last Russian out of their country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=315.62s)]
*  It's exactly the right question, Joe, and what concerns me is when people get this illusion [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=319.88s)]
*  and increasingly come to the... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=324.76s)]
*  Where you and I are, that as desirable as it is, it's simply not feasible, they're going [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=326.88s)]
*  to increasingly say, and we're hearing it in the House, we're hearing it in parts of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=331.88s)]
*  Europe, why should we keep doing this? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=334.92s)]
*  We're already stretched, we're trying to support Israel, we're worried about Taiwan, and even [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=336.76s)]
*  if we give everything we need to give or want to give to Ukraine, it still won't lead to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=342.04s)]
*  success. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=346.36s)]
*  What I argue, therefore, is the United States needs to have some very direct conversations [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=347.36s)]
*  with Ukraine, with President Zelensky, talk about... [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=352.64s)]
*  There's really nobody more despicable than these people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=356.56s)]
*  First of all, they look at war as a fun little game that they get to just kind of play with [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=360.56s)]
*  on their screens and feel good about themselves with and accuse their political adversaries [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=364.98s)]
*  of being traitors. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=370.56s)]
*  Seriously, do you think there's even been a one second of thought that Joe Scarborough [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=372.44s)]
*  has given to how many people, how many young Ukrainian men lost their lives in Ukraine [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  fighting in this war that they were forced to fight, even though all along there was [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=383.68s)]
*  no plausible scenario in which they achieved their stated goals? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=388.0s)]
*  They don't care in the slightest, in the slightest about Ukrainians or Ukraine. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=394.56s)]
*  It's all a game to them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=403.16s)]
*  And now they just turn around and say, look, of course, what you and I know, us reasonable [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=406.16s)]
*  people we know, there's no way Zelensky can win this war. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=409.88s)]
*  And now we have to sit down with him and say, look, the gig is up. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=414.2s)]
*  Time to sit down and give away part of your country. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=418.36s)]
*  They were eager to destroy anybody's reputation who suggested that all along, and they are [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=422.88s)]
*  now going to pretend that they were among the people doing that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  These people make me sick. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  They're talking about having Russia control 20% of Ukrainian territory as though that's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=451.6s)]
*  some kind of victory, as though they accomplished that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  They can be proud of that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  And now we're all supposed to pretend that when they go to the negotiating table and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=463.72s)]
*  hand over 20% of Ukraine to Putin, that that's some kind of success. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=468.20000000000005s)]
*  Like, oh, well, we got most of their country back for them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=474.36s)]
*  I'd never believe that Putin wanted to take over all of Ukraine. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=478.0s)]
*  He attacked Kiev because, of course, that's what you do at the start of the war, to try [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=481.2s)]
*  and discombobulate the government, to try and destabilize them, to not have them understand [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=484.44s)]
*  where the attack is coming from. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=489.76s)]
*  But Russians in Moscow were saying all along that their goal was to liberate these parts [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=491.28s)]
*  of eastern Ukraine that they viewed to be repressively abused by Kiev, by the central [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  government in Kiev. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  They've been fighting for that goal for years by arming separatists in the Donbas. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  And of course, they're going to keep Crimea. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's what they wanted. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=507.8s)]
*  But anybody who said, oh, let's just give Russia 20% of Ukraine as part of a deal would [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=511.56s)]
*  have been mauled just a few days ago. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=518.84s)]
*  And now because it's what Biden's going to do, they're all acting like that's the thing [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=521.32s)]
*  that we were trying to achieve all along. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  ...we should cease fire as an interim arrangement to expose the Russians for what they are so [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  we can rebuild support for Ukraine in this country. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=534.56s)]
*  But we've had two fighting seasons. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=538.2399999999999s)]
*  The idea that one or two or three more years of this is going to result in success, I simply [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=540.5999999999999s)]
*  don't see it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=545.52s)]
*  Russia's on a war footing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=546.52s)]
*  They have access also to arms from North Korea and Iran. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=547.7199999999999s)]
*  So I just think, anytime in foreign policy, anytime in life, there's a big gap between [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=551.0799999999999s)]
*  what you're trying to do and your ability to do it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  You've either got to increase your means or lower your goals. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  And I think here the only realistic option as a tactical measure is to lower our goals. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=561.8s)]
*  Lower our goals. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=567.3599999999999s)]
*  Right on the screen it says redefining success in Ukraine. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=568.3599999999999s)]
*  Yes, you know what they're doing? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=572.16s)]
*  They're redefining success in Ukraine to mean complete and total failure, a loss, another [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=573.9599999999999s)]
*  American war loss. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  They're kind of proud of themselves because this time they didn't require any American [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=585.52s)]
*  soldiers to lose their lives. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=589.12s)]
*  They kept talking about how they're so happy they only pay for it and send Ukrainians to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=590.6s)]
*  die. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=594.4s)]
*  Redefining success in Ukraine, that is such an Orwellian phrase because what it means [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=597.28s)]
*  is accepting defeat and trying to convince Americans we actually won so they don't look [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=602.2s)]
*  at us with even more contempt than they already hold us in. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=607.9s)]
*  The situation is to lower our goals. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=610.32s)]
*  Well, you know, Cady, the situation is often fluid, has been fluid in Ukraine for quite [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=615.5200000000001s)]
*  some time. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=623.36s)]
*  But we're at a new stage. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=624.36s)]
*  Just like we talked about after October 7th. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  That war was going to go in stages. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=632.96s)]
*  The Ukrainian war has gone in stages and now Russia is dug in defensively. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=635.52s)]
*  They're not having generals run up to the line so snipers can take them out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=642.8s)]
*  They're not exposing themselves to aerial bombardment. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=648.56s)]
*  They are dug in in a defensive posture and that has made all the difference in how quick... [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=652.72s)]
*  That has been true since at least a year ago. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=660.02s)]
*  We've been dug in. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=664.04s)]
*  We had Richard Medhurst on our show, who people will call a conspiracy theorist, this little [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  YouTube show, and I kept saying he was probably the smartest and best person to talk about [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=670.64s)]
*  this war if anybody I've heard. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=675.48s)]
*  And I heard him talking about back in February the World War I and World War II trench tactics [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=678.28s)]
*  Russia was using, their defensive postures with dragon teeth and bunkers that were very [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=685.36s)]
*  deep and multiple layers of defensive trenches that the Ukrainians could never hope to breach. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=690.88s)]
*  He turned out to be completely right. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=698.36s)]
*  Obviously he's not put on the media. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=702.1999999999999s)]
*  If he was heard on the media, he would be called a Russian agent for sure. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's listen to the rest of this. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=710.36s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=711.52s)]
*  Do you see there's not one second of, hey, by the way, we should point out that our network [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=712.52s)]
*  for the last 18 months has been saying something completely the opposite of what we're now [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=718.04s)]
*  saying because they know every other network and every other media corporation and everyone [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=721.4s)]
*  in the government and everyone in the Republican and Democratic Party who supported this is [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=726.4s)]
*  all going to get together and pretend that they knew all along that this is what they [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=729.96s)]
*  were hoping for. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=733.64s)]
*  Redefining success in Ukraine is what it even says on the screen. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=735.56s)]
*  ...Clear how slowly those lines are moving. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=741.56s)]
*  The Russians had enough time as Ukraine was preparing this offensive to build those defensive [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=744.6s)]
*  lines with trenches and land mines and making it very difficult for the Ukrainians to push [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=749.76s)]
*  through. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=756.12s)]
*  I was told recently that the Ukrainians have only taken back 0.25% of the land that Russia [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=757.12s)]
*  took in the east of the country. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=763.4s)]
*  Oh my God, that is the counteroffensive. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=765.12s)]
*  I'm about to show you how these people in the media were saying this counteroffensive [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=768.2s)]
*  is going to change everything. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=772.64s)]
*  It's a game changer. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=774.2399999999999s)]
*  Just hold on. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=775.2399999999999s)]
*  Keep supporting this. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=776.2399999999999s)]
*  The counteroffensive is coming. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=778.2399999999999s)]
*  They took back 0.025%. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=780.16s)]
*  That's basically nothing. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=785.0s)]
*  That is nothing. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  The Russians actually took more on that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=788.4799999999999s)]
*  The reality is the line barely moved, but on that the Russians took back more than the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  Ukrainians took back with this unbelievably exciting counteroffensive that was going to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=795.8s)]
*  transform the whole war and push the Russians out of southern Ukraine and then out of eastern [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=800.4s)]
*  Ukraine they were going to cut them off, break their supply chain. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=805.6s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=810.52s)]
*  And clearly not nearly enough to persuade policy makers up on Capitol Hill that it's [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=811.52s)]
*  worth carrying on funding them. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  Now the Europeans have actually now matching the Americans when it comes to military spending [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=819.56s)]
*  on Ukraine, but they wouldn't be able to pick up all of the slack. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=824.92s)]
*  I guess the only question with what you're proposing, Richard, is that would that then [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=828.5999999999999s)]
*  look like victory for Vladimir Putin? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=832.56s)]
*  I mean, effectively. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=834.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh, you think? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=835.7199999999999s)]
*  Do you think it might look like victory for Vladimir Putin if he ends up with 20% of Ukraine [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=836.7199999999999s)]
*  despite the fact that he fought all of NATO, which said all along that the only acceptable [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=842.3599999999999s)]
*  goal is to expel every single Russian troop from every single part of Ukrainian soil, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=847.56s)]
*  including Crimea? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=852.1199999999999s)]
*  Do you think it might look like success for Vladimir Putin if he ends up with one-fifth [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=854.4s)]
*  of Ukraine? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=858.04s)]
*  If the U.S. ends up having to beg him to accept that, maybe he won't. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=859.04s)]
*  Maybe he'll want more. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=863.48s)]
*  He'll be able to sell that and he will sell that as victory back at home. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=864.48s)]
*  But even if we step back with a more objective eye and think, well, okay, so they didn't [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=870.36s)]
*  take Kiev, but they took a big chunk of the country in the east. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=874.16s)]
*  And was this an indication that the Russians actually won effectively? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=878.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=883.12s)]
*  Look where Russia started. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=884.12s)]
*  They wanted to basically eliminate Ukraine as a sovereign, independent... [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=885.12s)]
*  Oh my God, these people are such unbelievable liars. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=888.68s)]
*  They will say anything, anything. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=891.36s)]
*  They're going to try and sell this as a victory. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=895.52s)]
*  Get ready. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=897.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, just to conclude, in June, so we're talking about four months ago, Max Boot, the neocon [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=899.5600000000001s)]
*  warmonger who cheers every single war and has for 25 years that he never ever gets near [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=908.96s)]
*  the front line. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=914.48s)]
*  He sends everybody else to fight in these wars. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=915.48s)]
*  Classic vintage neocon scumbag. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  Brought out David Petraeus, who was the heralded brilliant general under President Bush, who [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=921.24s)]
*  was going to lead to a reversal of the Iraq war with the surge that the neocons were selling [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=928.24s)]
*  that never went anywhere. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=933.52s)]
*  And then he was going to bring in these brilliant counter insurgency tactics to Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  that changed nothing. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=940.76s)]
*  And then he ultimately had a sad ending because he was convicted of giving classified information, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=942.48s)]
*  in fact, the most sensitive type to his mistress so she could write a hagiography about him, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=946.96s)]
*  a book that was going to praise him to the sky. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=953.0s)]
*  He's now hurled out and there you see the headline, the Ukrainian offensive is beginning. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=956.24s)]
*  David Petraeus is optimistic. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=959.6s)]
*  Talking about how he went to Ukraine, met with military and civilian officials, came [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=962.84s)]
*  back so excited about the counter offensive, understands the difficulties and challenges, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=967.28s)]
*  that is sure it's going to win. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=971.88s)]
*  How do these people never lose their standing, their accountability? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=975.0s)]
*  The minute there's a new war, as there is now, Max Boot and David Petraeus are going [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=980.24s)]
*  to be brought out to CNN and the pages of the Washington Post and they're going to tell [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=983.28s)]
*  you again how to think about this war even though they have nothing but a history of [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=986.72s)]
*  failure and lying. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=990.56s)]
*  The Ukrainian offensive is beginning. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=993.48s)]
*  David Petraeus is optimistic. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=995.16s)]
*  It was a complete disaster and it was predictable. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=997.38s)]
*  We had John Mearsheimer on our show and other analysts who were saying that at the time, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1000.9599999999999s)]
*  at the time not afterward, explaining in detail all the reasons Russia could never win, Ukraine [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1006.88s)]
*  could never win and why this counter offensive was a fraud. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1013.64s)]
*  Just an excuse to spend another six months giving money to the US military industrial [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1018.36s)]
*  complex, putting who knows how much money in the pockets of Zelensky and his cronies [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1023.76s)]
*  in Ukraine and having more and more Ukrainians die just to get to this point that we were [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1029.32s)]
*  always going to get to, which was having to negotiate with Russia about how much land [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1034.76s)]
*  they were going to take of Ukraine so they could feel safe. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1039.6s)]
*  It's not just these people are wrong, they are mortally despicable. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1044.84s)]
*  The Ukrainians and the Russians could have had a deal, they were close to a deal, they [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1049.56s)]
*  tried to have a deal from the start and a lot of people like Naftali Bennett, the former [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbepV0UIYtU&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
