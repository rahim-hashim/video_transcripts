# Glenn Reacts to Tucker's REVEALING Ted Cruz Interview
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk)
*  So the idea of once again doing regime change in Iran after the 1953 regime change effort [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=0.0s)]
*  by the CIA was what led to so much anti-American hatred and so many antagonisms between the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=14.5s)]
*  United States and Iran for decades in the first place. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=19.5s)]
*  The idea of not just going back and doing that again as Ted Cruz wants to, as Lindsey [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=21.48s)]
*  Graham wants to, as Tom Cotton wants to, as Netanyahu wants to. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=24.54s)]
*  They actually want to reinstall the Shah of Iran. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=29.36s)]
*  They want to install the Shah of Iran's idiot son who basically has made himself into a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=32.04s)]
*  loyalist to Israel and the United States, knowing that's how his father kept power as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=40.24s)]
*  He has no connection to Iran. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=45.56s)]
*  He hasn't lived there for decades. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  He's been educated in the West. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  He's been enriched by the West. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=51.0s)]
*  There's pictures of him in Ayamaka, at the Western Wall in Israel, constantly making [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=53.08s)]
*  defenses of Israel in the United States. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=57.63999999999999s)]
*  That's who ultimately the Ted Cruz's and Lindsey Graham's and Netanyahu's of the world want [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=60.8s)]
*  to reinstall as the leader of this very important country, very important in terms of oil resources, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=64.52s)]
*  geopolitics, its proximity to the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, all sorts of vital [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=71.32s)]
*  geopolitical and economic resources that currently Iran controls but that the United States wants [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=78.24s)]
*  to control through Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=83.97999999999999s)]
*  It's a massively consequential and an extremely risky proposal, to put that very mildly, to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=87.76s)]
*  advocate as Ted Cruz's another regime change war after all the ones we fought in Afghanistan, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=97.12s)]
*  in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya, and Vietnam have all been utterly disastrous on every level, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=103.04s)]
*  not just for the countries where we fought them but especially for the United States [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=110.44s)]
*  and American citizens as well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=113.92s)]
*  Mark Carlson went to this interview with the intention of really getting questions about [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=116.36s)]
*  Ted Cruz's view about why it's in America's interest to go and fight for Iran or whether [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=121.44s)]
*  really fighting for Israel but he also wanted to understand how much Ted Cruz knew and knows [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  about this country whose government he wants to change, whose country, this country that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=133.48s)]
*  he wants to bomb, have the United States start a new war with and change their government. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=137.0s)]
*  If you would think you would at least know a pretty good amount about a country, if you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=144.84s)]
*  feel confident, confident to say we're going to go in and we're going to change that government [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=148.72s)]
*  and good things are going to happen, you should know a pretty good amount about that country, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=152.28s)]
*  like who lives there, what the composition of the people are, what their views are, what [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=156.32s)]
*  the factions are, how many people live there, what the size of the, you know, very basic [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=161.32s)]
*  things that you probably would learn from a geography class in 10th grade or like a freshman [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=165.32s)]
*  class on Middle East history in college. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=170.32s)]
*  The Senate are proposing a major war, especially a regime change war, would know that so Tucker [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Carlson wanted to see how much Ted Cruz understood, what was his understanding about this country, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=176.76s)]
*  Iran, a very complex country with a very long and rich history, coming out of the Persian [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Empire, how much he actually knows about Iran and how that knowledge integrates into his [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=185.84s)]
*  desire to go have a U.S. fight a regime change war and here was the outcome of Tucker Carlson [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=191.76s)]
*  seeking that understanding. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=197.76s)]
*  How many people live in Iran by the way? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=199.24s)]
*  I don't know the population. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=202.0s)]
*  At all? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=203.0s)]
*  No, I don't know the population. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=204.0s)]
*  You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=206.6s)]
*  How many people live in Iran? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=210.92s)]
*  92 million. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=211.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=212.92s)]
*  How could you not know that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=213.92s)]
*  I don't sit around memorizing population tables. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=216.88s)]
*  Well it's kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the government. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  Why is it relevant whether it's 90 million or 80 million or 100 million? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=223.56s)]
*  Why is that relevant? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=227.2s)]
*  Well because if you don't know anything about the country. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=228.2s)]
*  I didn't say I don't know anything about the country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=229.2s)]
*  Okay, what's the ethnic mix of Iran? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=230.2s)]
*  All right, before we move on to the ethnic mix of Iran, a lot of people have been saying [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=231.2s)]
*  defenders of Ted Cruz who are really defenders of Trump's war in Iran and more broadly defenders [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=236.6s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  That's really what's at the root of this as you're about to see, not that that's a surprise, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  but it's going to come out of Ted Cruz's mouth very explicitly in ways that will shock you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=245.56s)]
*  Not to learn that it's true, but just because it's going to be shocking that someone gets [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  so flustered that they admit that at the heart of their politics and their service as a U.S. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=254.12s)]
*  Senator is not the interest of the United States, but the interest of Israel as you're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=258.72s)]
*  about to hear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=261.44000000000005s)]
*  Again, there's nothing surprising about that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=262.44000000000005s)]
*  Everyone knows that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=264.68s)]
*  It's just very unusual to hear someone say it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=265.68s)]
*  So a lot of defenders of Ted Cruz were saying, oh, so he doesn't know the exact precise population [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=269.32000000000005s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  He didn't know if it was 93 million or 95. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  No, he didn't know at all. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  He didn't know anything. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=280.94000000000005s)]
*  He didn't know. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=281.94000000000005s)]
*  He couldn't even venture a guess. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=282.94000000000005s)]
*  He could not even enter the range of universes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=285.0s)]
*  He didn't know if they had five million people or 20 million people or 80 million or 130. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=288.68s)]
*  I just want to say, as somebody who does this for a living, even though I'm not vested with [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=294.56s)]
*  the responsibility and the power as a U.S. Senator that the Constitution bestows on Ted [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=300.52s)]
*  Cruz to approve or disapprove of wars or to call for them as he's doing or to exercise [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=303.8s)]
*  them, just as somebody who does work as a journalist, who's covered foreign policy for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=312.02s)]
*  a long time, I cannot tell you how many times over the last 15 to 20 years when Iran has [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=316.14s)]
*  been discussed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=322.46s)]
*  And remember, desire for war with Iran is not new. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=323.46s)]
*  When I started writing about politics, it was in 2005, by which point everyone knew [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=328.26s)]
*  the war in Iraq was a failure, but neocons were still pushing for the U.S. to move from [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=332.88s)]
*  overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Baghdad to going to Tehran to do the same that has been [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=337.14s)]
*  the Netanyahu-Israel U.S. neocon project for many years. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=341.26s)]
*  And the amount of times that I have talked about the population size of Iran, and I'm [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  not special in any way, you cannot pay minimal attention to the Middle East, to foreign policy, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  to wars, to Iran, to Iraq, to Israel, to Saudi Arabia, if you don't have some basic idea [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=356.68s)]
*  of the size of each country, of their population. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  And probably just in the last year alone, or let's say the last six months alone, as [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=367.26000000000005s)]
*  this idea of a war with Iran became more and more vocally expressed, I honestly could not [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=372.3s)]
*  count the number of times I have pointed out that Iran is more than three times, has more [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  than three times the population size of Iraq when we went to war with it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=386.82000000000005s)]
*  We went to war with Iraq in 2003, their population was 26 million. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=392.06s)]
*  So if you multiply that by three, you get 78 million, and I've often emphasized the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=398.02s)]
*  population of Iran is larger, larger than three times larger than the population of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=402.38s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=407.86s)]
*  So if you said to me, what is the exact number, I wouldn't be able to give you the exact number, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=408.86s)]
*  but I certainly knew it was somewhere between 85 and 95 million people. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=411.54s)]
*  I probably would have said 90 million, that was my understanding. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=415.3s)]
*  I'm not inventing that, I'm not pretending that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  I can show you an endless number of clips where I've talked about that on this show, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=420.22s)]
*  in interviews, in podcasts, it's just so basic. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=425.26000000000005s)]
*  How do you not know that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=428.54s)]
*  If you're just that person who pays minimal attention to the Middle East and questions [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=429.54s)]
*  of foreign policy, how do you not know the relative size of Iran to other countries in [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=437.42s)]
*  the Middle East? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  Especially how do you not know if you're advocating a regime change war in the realm the way Ted [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  Cruz is? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=447.5s)]
*  You would study the last major regime change war that the United States engaged in, which [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=450.14s)]
*  was Iraq. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=455.3s)]
*  We've done other ones in Syria and Libya, but Iraq is in that neighborhood, it's the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=456.3s)]
*  border and country of Iran, they've gone to war with each other. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=461.02s)]
*  You would think you would have some very basic understanding of the country, the crudest, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=463.02s)]
*  I'm not even talking yet about the geography of Iran or the complexities of their history [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=468.02s)]
*  or the religious strife or the various minorities they have there ethnically and religiously. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=475.46s)]
*  Obviously I'm talking about the population size, not to the number, just the general [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=481.46s)]

*  He has no idea, Ted Cruz has no idea, if he did he would have ventured a guess. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=488.06s)]
*  And had he said 75 million or 80 million, nobody would have cared. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=492.46s)]
*  Tucker would have said, yeah, no, it's 90 and okay, you had a general idea, if he said [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=497.73999999999995s)]
*  100 million, he had no idea, no idea, none. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=501.21999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't that he was off by a couple million, a couple hundred million, a couple million, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=505.26s)]
*  he had no clue. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=510.74s)]
*  And yet this is one of the leading senators who goes on Meet the Press and Face the Nation [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=512.22s)]
*  and Fox News every night and is presented as the expert because he's supposed to be [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=518.0s)]
*  an expert. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=522.54s)]
*  If you're one of 100 US senators who has a duty to vote on war, you're supposed to be [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=523.54s)]
*  an expert, he's presented as an expert and then he goes on and talks about the reason [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=528.9399999999999s)]
*  why we must go to war with Iran, why we must engineer regime change there. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=532.26s)]
*  He's been doing that for years. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=535.62s)]
*  But look at the ignorance about the country he not only wants to bomb, but the country [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=538.58s)]
*  whose government he wants to change. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=545.14s)]
*  Just in terms of the regime change alone, obviously if you want to go and change the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=547.54s)]
*  government of a country, you take out the government that's there and replace it with [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=554.46s)]
*  one that you prefer, the Chabaran son, idiot son or whoever. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=560.24s)]
*  Obviously you have to figure out like is regime change feasible? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  What type of resources, military or economic would be needed to ensure that it happens [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=569.68s)]
*  in a way that is effective, that is similar to the way you want? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=574.84s)]
*  But you'd also want to be able to assess what might be the unanticipated negative consequences [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=579.72s)]
*  of smashing a country to smithereens of destroying its central government with the idea of replacing [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=585.16s)]
*  it with someone else. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  You might want to look at the last time that we did that which was Iraq and the utter and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  complete destruction and power vacuum that that created or the times when we did it in [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=596.36s)]
*  Syria and Libya that created massive refugee and migrant crises and waves of huge numbers [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=601.16s)]
*  of immigrants to Germany and to the rest of Europe which continues to have massive impact [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=607.76s)]
*  to this day. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=613.64s)]
*  How could you possibly advocate a regime change of our country and not just having voted on [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=614.64s)]
*  it in the background, volunteered to be one of the leading voices advocating for the media [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=621.68s)]
*  and not be able to answer that question in even a general way. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=625.6s)]
*  It is shocking. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=629.56s)]
*  It is horrifying. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=630.56s)]
*  These are the kind of people who have been running US foreign policy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=632.6s)]
*  These were exactly the people who assured you in 2002 and 2003 that they were going [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=634.76s)]
*  the whole country was going to unify very quickly because they all hated Saddam Hussein. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=642.0s)]
*  They were going to welcome us as liberators. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=645.0s)]
*  They were going to unite across sectarian lines, form a Jeffersonian democracy that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=646.44s)]
*  was allied. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=652.92s)]
*  None of that happened. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=653.92s)]
*  None of it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=654.92s)]
*  Even close because these people have no concept of the foreign countries that they want to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=655.92s)]
*  transform, that they want to invade, that they want to bomb, that they want to destroy. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=659.44s)]
*  They don't understand anything about these cultures, anything about these countries. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=663.12s)]
*  If you need any proof, look at that exchange with Ted Cruz. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=668.2s)]
*  Ted Cruz is a smart person. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=674.1600000000001s)]
*  He went to the best schools. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=677.36s)]
*  He debates well. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=679.36s)]
*  For the US Senate, maybe he's as good as it gets. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  He's a complete imbecile when it comes to, and so irresponsible, when it comes to what [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  has now become his primary issue, which is urging the US government not just to bomb [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=693.5999999999999s)]
*  Iran, eliminate their nuclear facilities, but also to change the regime. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=698.0s)]
*  In one sense, it's shocking to watch, but in another, I say it's so illustrative because [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=702.52s)]
*  it is extremely common. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=706.52s)]
*  You could drag 100 senators like him, or however many are advocating for regime change. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=707.88s)]
*  Maybe some of them would know the general population, but they wouldn't know much more. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=713.7199999999999s)]
*  Let's listen to the rest of this one. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=718.38s)]
*  Tucker Carlson is, okay, you have no idea how many people live there, but let's talk about [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=720.56s)]
*  what kind of people live there. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=723.44s)]
*  Think, MacSupra. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=725.2800000000001s)]
*  Think, MacSupra. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=728.24s)]
*  About the country. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=729.24s)]
*  I didn't say I don't know anything about the country. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=730.24s)]
*  Okay, what's the ethnic mix of Iran? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  They are Persians and predominantly Shia. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=734.6400000000001s)]
*  Okay, this is cute. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=737.0400000000001s)]
*  You don't know anything about Iran. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=738.96s)]
*  So actually the country. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran who says- [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow of the government, and you don't know anything [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  about the country. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=748.6400000000001s)]
*  No, you don't know anything about the country. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=749.6400000000001s)]
*  You're the one who claims they're not trying to murder Donald Trump. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=751.04s)]
*  You're the one who can't figure out a saying- [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=753.64s)]
*  Okay, the ethnic and religious composition of a country is absolutely vital to understanding [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=756.64s)]
*  what the country might look like, what might actually happen inside that country if you [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  go and destroy and remove and shatter the central government that has run that country [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=770.8399999999999s)]
*  for the last 45 years, which is what Ted Cruz wants to do. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the example of Yugoslavia, which was ruled with an iron fist during the Cold War [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=782.4s)]
*  by its dictator, Marsal Tito, and when he died and that unifying force, as repressive [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=794.04s)]
*  and violent as it was, disappeared, the entire country disintegrated. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=801.04s)]
*  It was the only thing holding it together, and it led to absolutely horrific atrocities [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=806.32s)]
*  and massive civil wars between the various religious factions, the provinces, the Serbs [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=810.2800000000001s)]
*  and the Muslims and the Bosnians, and Kosovo and the rest of the country. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=816.84s)]
*  That had- it fell apart, and it led to years of war that the United States ended up being [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=823.1600000000001s)]
*  involved in very heavily and directly by bombing Belgrade with its defensive alliance, NATO. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=828.72s)]
*  I don't know what they thought they were defending. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=836.76s)]
*  They certainly- Yugoslavia was no threat to Europe. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=839.04s)]
*  That's a whole propagandistic narrative for another day, but obviously you would want [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=842.68s)]
*  to understand what would happen, what would likely happen to a country if you destroyed [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=846.52s)]
*  the government that has been running it for 45 years. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  Would it unify? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  Is there like an overwhelming religious faction or ethnic faction? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=855.04s)]
*  Does that cross lines? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=860.36s)]
*  What percentage of each group composes that country? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=861.94s)]
*  This is not, you know, very esoteric stuff. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=865.88s)]
*  I mean, if you were Destiny, the YouTuber, you would at least, like before an interview [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=869.76s)]
*  like this, go read a Wikipedia page and then pretend to be an expert, and you would have [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=879.04s)]
*  the answers. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=884.4399999999999s)]
*  That's how simple and primitive these questions are. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  You could actually have the level of knowledge that someone like Destiny has by reading a [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=887.76s)]
*  Wikipedia page. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=892.16s)]
*  He doesn't even have that, Ted Cruz. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=893.16s)]
*  He's like, yeah, they're Persian, they're Shia. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=894.64s)]
*  Has no idea what percentage of each, let alone other groups in the country. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=897.92s)]
*  Here's how he now tries to turn the table, knowing that his extreme ignorance got exposed. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=904.36s)]
*  I want to say again, this is not some trivia quiz. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not a gotcha question, the way a lot of idiots who are defending Ted Cruz are claiming. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=913.16s)]
*  These are things you have to know about a country. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=918.3199999999999s)]
*  Really any major country in the world. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=921.48s)]
*  Like, do you think there are senators, I'm sure there are, that don't know the relative [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=923.8s)]
*  populations of the top, say, five most populous countries of China, of India, of Indonesia, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=930.36s)]
*  of the United States, of Brazil? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=935.9599999999999s)]
*  Do you think there are ones who don't know that? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=937.76s)]
*  I'm sure there are tons of them. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=942.48s)]
*  But at the very least, if you're going to go and volunteer to be an advocate for a war [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=943.48s)]
*  in a new country, you have to have an understanding, the most basic understanding of what that [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=947.88s)]
*  country is and what the people who live there are. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=951.68s)]
*  And he has not, he does not have that. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=953.56s)]
*  And I promise you, he's not unique. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=957.0s)]
*  Here's the rest of this. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=959.52s)]
*  No, I'm not saying that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=960.52s)]
*  You're the one who can't figure out if it was a good idea to kill General Soleimani [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=962.48s)]
*  and you said it was bad. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=965.4s)]
*  You don't believe they're trying to murder Trump? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=966.4s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=967.8s)]
*  Because you're not calling for military strikes against them and retaliation. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=968.8s)]
*  If you really believe that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=971.2800000000001s)]
*  We're carrying out military strikes today. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=972.2800000000001s)]
*  You said Israel was. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=974.48s)]
*  Right, with our help. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=975.48s)]
*  I said we. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=977.2800000000001s)]

*  Well, you're breaking news here because the U.S. government last night denied, the National [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=980.08s)]
*  Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer denied on behalf of Trump that we were acting [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=984.24s)]
*  on Israel's behalf in any offensive capacity at all. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=988.6s)]
*  We're not bombing them. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=991.0400000000001s)]
*  Israel's bombing them. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=992.0400000000001s)]
*  You just said we were. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=993.0400000000001s)]
*  We are supporting Israel. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=995.12s)]
*  It's high stakes. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=996.12s)]
*  You're a senator. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=997.12s)]
*  If you're saying the United States government is at war with Iran right now, people are [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=998.12s)]
*  listening. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1000.76s)]
*  I mean, you know, that part speaks for itself. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1003.76s)]
*  Let me just address this. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1006.76s)]
*  It is kind of amazing. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1008.76s)]
*  Like they can't even keep their lives straight. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1009.76s)]
*  It's only five days into the war. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1011.76s)]
*  Remember when the war started, Mark Ruby came out and said they just told the unilateral [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1014.76s)]
*  this is Israel's unilateral war. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1017.76s)]
*  It was obviously a lie from the start. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1019.76s)]
*  They pretended they were negotiating with Iran, that Israel ruined it, but somehow nobody [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1022.76s)]
*  was upset with Israel for having done that. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1026.76s)]
*  And within like six seconds, it was revealed that we were centrally involved in all their [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1028.76s)]
*  operations that Trump in the morning when he saw Fox News celebrating his success, came [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1032.76s)]
*  forth and stopped talking about Israel and talked about it as my war. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1037.76s)]
*  We did this. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1041.76s)]
*  We did that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1042.76s)]
*  The whole propaganda edifice fell apart very quickly to the point where Ted Cruz can't [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1045.76s)]
*  even keep it straight. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1049.76s)]
*  But you know, this other thing about Iran tried to kill President Trump. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1050.76s)]
*  Let's remember that we know a little bit about the person who was caught on Trump's golf [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1057.76s)]
*  course in the second assassination attempt. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1061.76s)]
*  He was an American citizen. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1064.76s)]
*  He was obsessed with Ukraine. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1066.76s)]
*  He spent a lot of time in Ukraine. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1067.76s)]
*  He was hating anybody who opposed military to Ukraine like Trump. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1069.76s)]
*  He was ingratiated in various militias and military forces of the Ukrainians. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1074.76s)]
*  And then he comes back and he's armed to the teeth. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1080.76s)]
*  And he wants to he goes to a golf course where President Trump is playing it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1084.76s)]
*  Maybe one or two holes ahead is waiting to blow his head off. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1089.76s)]
*  And simply because the Secret Service, by luck, happened to see the gun sticking out, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1092.76s)]
*  did they apprehend him. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1095.76s)]
*  So we know that doesn't have anything to do with Iran. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1098.76s)]
*  That assassination attempt, the only country, I'm not saying they're involved, but the only [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1102.76s)]
*  country that's meaningfully connected to that assassin that would be assassinated is Ukraine. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1106.76s)]
*  And we know shockingly little, basically nothing, about the person who actually did fire shots [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1110.76s)]
*  and came like a millimeter ahead from entering Trump's brain, had he not turned his head at the last second. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1118.76s)]
*  No one suggested he has any connection to Iran. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1126.76s)]
*  He's like he's just like almost this out of the matrix figure who never implanted a single footprint of any kind in this world where we're all surveilled. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1128.76s)]
*  We all use the internet, no footprint at all. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1139.76s)]
*  He's like this mystery figure. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1141.76s)]
*  It's the kind of person who just like emerged from the from the heavens, came down, shot Trump, and then just disappeared, dispersed. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1142.76s)]
*  And we know nothing about him. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1152.76s)]
*  But there's certainly no evidence Iran was involved in that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1153.76s)]
*  And of course, during the campaign, there started to be these anonymous reports that the Iranians were trying to murder Trump. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1155.76s)]
*  So obvious, so obvious what the motive of that was. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1159.76s)]
*  I mean, if you want Trump to go to a war with the country, what is the thing that you do? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1164.76s)]
*  You tell him that they're trying to kill him. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1167.76s)]
*  There was a prosecutorial indictment presented, which of course people want to presume is true now. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1170.76s)]
*  The same people who called every prosecutorial report of Russia gate lies who pick and choose when they want to believe prosecutorial allegations. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1176.76s)]
*  Certainly no meaningful evidence of that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1185.76s)]
*  But Ted Cruz is now resorting to the fact that, oh, we have to go because fight this war because Iran tried to kill Trump. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1188.76s)]
*  First of all, just it shows you how complete of a replication of the 2002 2003 Iraq war script this is because some of you probably don't recall. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1195.76s)]
*  But during the buildup to the Iraq war, George W. Bush claimed that Iraq under Saddam Hussein tried to kill George Bush's father, George W. Bush, who led the war against Iraq in Kuwait. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1206.76s)]
*  And I remember the interview very well or this press comments very well when they were asking Bush about why it was necessary to go and take out Saddam. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1221.76s)]
*  And one of the things he said was, well, he tried to kill my dad, tried to kill my dad. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1231.76s)]
*  It's very like a whole narrative like he was going to go avenge the person who tried to kill his dad by sending the US military in to take him out. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1235.76s)]
*  So we have to have like this every part of that play that theater that was presented to convince people to go join that war now has to be presented for this one too, including, oh, we tried to kill Trump. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1243.76s)]
*  But it's not like if we really believed if we really believe that there was a genuine meaningful effort on the part of the Iranian government to assassinate Donald Trump, presumably they would have gotten into office and immediately said we're going to bomb Iran. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1253.76s)]
*  We're going to bomb their leadership and we wouldn't have had to rely on this whole pretext about their nuclear program and negotiating with them. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1269.76s)]
*  Why would if that's the reason if that's what is part of what is the motive, why didn't we why did we have to wait for Israel to go bomb Iran under the pretext that we weren't involved and they were doing it because of the nuclear facilities after a failed negotiation. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1276.76s)]
*  We couldn't just sit on the on January 21st. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1288.76s)]
*  Look, we're going to go bomb Iran because they tried to murder President Trump. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1290.76s)]
*  That was an act of war against our country. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1293.76s)]
*  They didn't say that they waited until the war happened. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1295.76s)]
*  They're like, hey, by the way, if you're not convinced yet, we should go to war with Iran. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1296.76s)]
*  Here's another reason to believe it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1301.76s)]
*  They tried to kill Trump. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1303.76s)]
*  That's what Tucker was saying. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1305.76s)]
*  Well, if that were true, it obviously isn't because if it were, you would not be waiting until all this happened to throw that in as a pretext. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1307.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1312.76s)]
*  So that was just one clip, an amazing clip, not amazing in the sense that it's shocking and amazing in the sense of how clearly laid out it was because I don't remember any journalists in the last 25 years broadcast journalists. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1314.76s)]
*  Asking a senator who wants to go and invade a country or change the government of a country or bomb that country or overthrow their leaders or whatever. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1326.76s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1333.76s)]
*  Hey, by the way, just tell me a few things you know about the country. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1335.76s)]
*  How big is it? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1337.76s)]
*  I wonder if Ted Cruz could even place a run on a map. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1339.76s)]
*  There's always been this sort of saying that Americans learn where countries are on a map. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1341.76s)]
*  Whenever their government decides and announces that they're going to go bomb that country or go to war with that country, the world like, oh, what's this country? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1348.76s)]
*  What do you see on the map? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1354.76s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1356.76s)]
*  Oh, Ukraine. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1357.76s)]
*  Well, OK, I see where Ukraine is. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1358.76s)]
*  I doubt honestly whether Ted Cruz could place a run on a map after hearing all that. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1360.76s)]
*  That's some of the most alarming stuff I've heard. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1366.76s)]
*  These are the decision makers. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1369.76s)]
*  These are the people in Trump's ear. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1371.76s)]
*  They have no idea what they're talking about. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1373.76s)]
*  None, zero. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1375.76s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1379.76s)]
*  What if I told you that there was a healthy aging product out there that could help your loved ones, your parents, your friends reverse aging at the cellular level, resulting in improved long term health and wellness, right? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1380.76s)]
*  That's why I'm so excited to share with you guys C15 from fatty 15, the first emerging essential fatty acid to be discovered in more than 90 years. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1393.76s)]
*  It's an incredible scientific breakthrough to support our long term health and wellness. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1402.76s)]
*  And you guessed it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1406.76s)]
*  Healthy aging based on over 100 studies. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1407.76s)]
*  We now know that C15 strengthens our cells and is a key healthy aging nutrient, which helps to slow biological aging at the cellular level. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1410.76s)]
*  In fact, when our cells don't have enough C15, that's when they become fragile and age faster to help combat that and further support healthy aging. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1418.76s)]
*  A team of doctors working in collaboration with the US Navy spent over a decade to develop the pure optimized and bioavailable C15 zero ingredient in fatty, sorry, C15 zero ingredient in fatty 15. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1426.76s)]
*  Best of all, fatty 15 comes in a gorgeous reusable glass bamboo jar. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1439.76s)]
*  A lot of these come in crappy little containers. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1444.76s)]
*  Not this fatty 15 comes in a gorgeous, beautiful, stunning, reusable glass bamboo jar. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1446.76s)]
*  And the refills are shipped right to your door. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1453.76s)]
*  You don't have to go anywhere to pick them up. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBDbJgRQnQk&t=1455.76s)]
