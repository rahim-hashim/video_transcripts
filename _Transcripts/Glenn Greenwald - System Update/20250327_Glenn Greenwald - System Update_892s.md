# Trump's El Salvador Deportations: On Hold?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8)
*  We reported previously last week on the controversy surrounding the fact that the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump administration during the campaign promised to mass deport illegal people [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=12.32s)]
*  in the United States illegally and deportations typically means, in fact [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=17.88s)]
*  always means, picking people up who are in your country illegally and sending [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=21.72s)]
*  them back to their country of origin. They get a very quick hearing in a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=25.44s)]
*  basically a quasi-court, a deportation court inside the Justice Department as [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=30.12s)]
*  long as the government can show they don't have the legal papers to be in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  the United States and the person can't show they have the legal documents, the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=38.36s)]
*  deportation is approved and they get sent back to their home country. And the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=42.32s)]
*  Trump administration is doing some of that, not nearly at the level promised, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  but they're doing some of it, but they're doing something much much [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=51.08s)]
*  different which is that they're picking people up, primarily Venezuelans up until [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=55.12s)]
*  now, and they're not sending them back to Venezuela, they're sending them to a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=61.76s)]
*  third country that these people have nothing to do with, that they're not [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  citizens of, that most, in most if not all cases they've never visited, which is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=71.12s)]
*  El Salvador. And the United States government is paying the government of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=75.64s)]
*  El Salvador not to accept them but to incarcerate them in one of the most [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=79.92s)]
*  horrific prisons that exists in the world, to film them being humiliated and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  dehumanized, all based on the accusation that the Trump administration refuses to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=92.88s)]
*  prove that these people are members of a violent gang, Tren de Arragua, based on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=98.04s)]
*  the invocation of war powers that has only been used three times previously in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=105.44s)]
*  actual wars, the war of 1812, the war of 1812, World War I, World War II, but even [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=110.36s)]
*  then the people who were ordered under the Alien Enemies Act to be deported got [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=117.4s)]
*  a hearing and yet the Trump administration is sending these people, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=124.88s)]
*  including people who have obviously compelling cases that they're not part [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=129.4s)]
*  of this gang that they've been mistaken for gang members, just like the US told us [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=133.56s)]
*  during Guantanamo, the war on terror, that only the worst of the worst were there and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=140.72s)]
*  it turned out many of the people there had nothing to do with terrorism. They [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=143.96s)]
*  were there, they were innocent, they were part of mistaken identity, any number of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  reasons why. That's what happens when you don't give to people due process, you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=150.52s)]
*  imprison people unjustly. And a federal district court judge ordered that this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=154.58s)]
*  stop, that no detainees be delivered to El Salvador without first getting a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=162.16s)]
*  hearing and the Trump administration rushed to move them there, brought 237 of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=168.8s)]
*  them there, refused to turn the plane around and a lot of Trump supporters have [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  been complaining, oh this is just a single federal judge, who is he to order [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=177.12s)]
*  the president to stop some policy based on his belief that it's unconstitutional [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=183.2s)]
*  or illegal, even though as we showed you on Monday night, that's how our system [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=189.16s)]
*  works. Conservatives have often got injunctions from single district court [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=193.48s)]
*  judges to stop Biden policy, to stop Obama policy, to stop Clinton policy, but [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=197.92s)]
*  the DOJ appealed that injunction, so it's not before just a single district judge [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=205.48s)]
*  now, it's before the US Court of Appeals, which is the highest appellate court in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=210.04s)]
*  the country. It's right below the Supreme Court in terms of prestige and they held [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=215.28s)]
*  an oral argument on Monday and we played a lot of that for you or some of it in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=221.12s)]
*  which we showed you how antagonistic, how adversarial, how aggressive the judges on [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=223.84s)]
*  the panel were being toward the Trump Justice Department's arguments about why [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=228.52s)]
*  they have the legal authority to do this and made quite clear that it's extremely [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=231.56s)]
*  likely that the appellate court would uphold that injunction so that now it's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=236.72s)]
*  not just a single federal court judge, it's the most prestigious appellate court [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=243.52s)]
*  in the country right below the Supreme Court that's doing so. And the three [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  judges were an Obama appointee, a George H.W. Bush appointee, and a Trump appointee. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=252.88s)]
*  And the decision that they issued today was a two-to-one decision which upheld [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=259.92s)]
*  this injunction that the federal district court issued or the Trump [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=267.2s)]
*  administration not to deport anyone else back to El Salvador, at least not without [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=269.88s)]
*  hearings. And even the judge in dissent, the Trump judge, emphasized that every [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=273.24s)]
*  single illegal alien, people inside the United States illegally, that the Trump [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=283.24s)]
*  administration proposes dissent to a prisoner of foreign country has a right [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=287.2s)]
*  to a habeas corpus hearing, to an opportunity to prove that he's being [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=291.44s)]
*  unjustly accused. The only reason he dissented was he said that the case [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=295.52s)]
*  should have been brought where they were detained and not in Washington. But on [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=301.56s)]
*  the substance of whether they have a due process rate, the dissenting judge [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=306.16s)]
*  agreed. It was essentially 3-0 on that question. Here you see the ruling. It says, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=311.44s)]
*  it is further ordered that the emergency motions for stay be denied. Separate [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=319.68s)]
*  concurring judgments of Judge Henderson, that's the Bush 41 judge, and Judge [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=325.4s)]
*  Millett, the Obama judge, and a dissenting statement of Judge Walker are [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=329.4s)]
*  attached. And this was from the ruling of Judge Henderson, the Bush 41 judge who [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=332.52s)]
*  ruled against the Trump DOJ. She wrote, quote, the Alien Enemies Act, AEA, contains [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=344.32s)]
*  two provisions, a conditional clause and an operative clause. The conditional [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=350.23999999999995s)]
*  clause limits the AEA's substantive authority to conflicts between the United [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=354.4s)]
*  States and a foreign power. Specifically, there must be, quote, there must be, one, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=358.56s)]
*  a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=364.0s)]
*  two, an invasion of predatory incursion, perpetrated, attempted, or threatened [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=367.64s)]
*  against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=373.04s)]
*  government, and three, a presidential public proclamation of the event. She went [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=376.16s)]
*  on, a central limit to this power is the act's conditional clause that the United [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=382.0s)]
*  States be at war or under invasion or predatory incursion. And she talked about [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=386.72s)]
*  how the only times it had ever been enacted was during traditional wars, the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=392.88000000000005s)]
*  War of 1812, World War I, World War II, how the founders enacted it specifically to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=397.16s)]
*  confront a possible war than the quasi war that they ended up fighting with the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=402.56s)]
*  French, and everything in the record of this law was that it needed, it needed to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  be invoked or needed to be available solely in the case of an actual war. And she went on to say that she's not issuing an opinion about whether or not there can be an invasion, but that the likelihood of victory is what the plaintiff's because she doesn't believe the AEA is applicable to fighting a few hundred members of a violent gang. That's not what the Alien Enemies Act is for. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=413.84s)]
*  And that's an important limitation on the law because this law gives the president [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=444.0s)]
*  enormous powers, very extraordinary powers. And that's why we have to be very careful [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  about the president's ability to just declare war. Otherwise, the Constitution [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=454.88s)]
*  makes no, has no purpose. Bush and Cheney claimed more powers because they were [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  fighting the war on terror. Any president could say, I'm, we're at war, and now I [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=463.2s)]
*  have the ability to do everything. But Judge Millett, the Obama judge, emphasized [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  that even under the, the AEA, the people who are ordered by the president [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=473.64s)]
*  deported always have a due process right and always did. Even the people accused [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=479.84s)]
*  of being Nazi sympathizers in World War II. Here's what she wrote. Judicial [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=485.2s)]
*  review has always been available to non-citizens detained or removed under [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=489.4s)]
*  the AEA. During the War of 1812, Chief Justice John Marshall and Federal [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=493.52s)]
*  District Judge St. George Tucker offered a British subject released [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=498.88s)]
*  ordered a British subject released because the local marshal had acted [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=503.88s)]
*  beyond his delegated authority by detaining the plaintiff without proper [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=507.08s)]
*  notice. And then she cites the histories of these cases in which even people, we [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  can go on, even people who are detained under these laws have been given due [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=520.6s)]
*  process. She then went on, the Supreme Court, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, we [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=527.4s)]
*  can go on. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court later agreed with the Chief Justice [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=532.36s)]
*  that those subject to the AEA are entitled to judicial review. And she cited [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=537.36s)]
*  a 1813 case from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that during the war in 1812, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=541.1600000000001s)]
*  people ordered by the president removed have a right to a hearing to contest the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=546.9200000000001s)]
*  accusations against them that they are really a threat. The judge went on, quote, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=551.6400000000001s)]
*  these early cases set a precedent followed during the 20th century. Review [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  was available during World War One, cites a 1919 case in a Federal District [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=558.88s)]
*  Judge, as well as World War Two, citing a US Supreme Court ruling in 1948 that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=565.12s)]
*  stated, quote, hearings are utilized by the executive to secure an informed basis [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=572.0s)]
*  for the exercise of summary power. She went on, quote, indeed, during World War [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=577.36s)]
*  Two, a former member of the Nazi Party not only received a hearing on his [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=581.52s)]
*  eligibility for removal, but also had his case heard by the Supreme Court. And [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=586.16s)]
*  she ruled that this removal is unconstitutional because as the Supreme [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=592.8s)]
*  Court ruled, even for detainees in Guantanamo, you cannot consign people to [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=597.28s)]
*  prison, even if they're in your country illegally, even if they're not citizens, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=603.16s)]
*  you cannot put people in prison based on an allegation that they're terrorists, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=607.12s)]
*  they're involved in a terrorist organization, that they're a violent member [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=612.04s)]
*  of a drug gang, without giving the accused, the person you want to put in prison, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=614.52s)]
*  the opportunity to demonstrate that the accusations are false, that they've gotten [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=621.04s)]
*  the wrong person, or to present evidence that convinces a court that they've been [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  wrongly accused. This is foundational to the American system, even in wartime. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=631.76s)]
*  Now, what's interesting is the Trump-appointed judge, Judge Walker, did [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=639.24s)]
*  dissent, but as I said, he dissented mostly on the grounds of where the case [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=642.4s)]
*  was brought. He said it shouldn't have been brought in Washington, but in Texas, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=647.24s)]
*  you have to bring it in the place where the people are detained, not where the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=650.24s)]
*  government officials are. And in his dissent, he said this, quote, the two [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=655.3199999999999s)]
*  sides of this case agree on very little. But what is at this point uncontested is [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=660.48s)]
*  that, quote, individuals identified as alien enemies may challenge that status [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=667.44s)]
*  in a habeas petition. And as I said, he went on to say that should have been [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=673.36s)]
*  brought in Texas, not Washington, therefore he would have dismissed the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=679.0s)]
*  case. He also said that there's delicate diplomacy, according to the government, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  going on between Venezuela and El Salvador and the United States, and that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=687.1600000000001s)]
*  a ruling like this might disrupt those diplomatic relations, and therefore the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=690.84s)]
*  equities are on the side of lifting the injunction. But all three of these judges [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=696.24s)]
*  agreed with the court point that you cannot send people to an unrelated [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  country based on an accusation that you haven't proven or given them an [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=705.24s)]
*  opportunity to contest. And as we've gone over, there's 150 years Supreme Court [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=710.2s)]
*  history that says that the Bill of Rights is not a list of protections given [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=715.4000000000001s)]
*  solely to a small group of people called American citizens. It is intended to be a [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=721.76s)]
*  constraint on what the US government does and can do with respect to everyone [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=725.8s)]
*  under their control. If the Trump administration wants to do mass [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  deportation, they convinced Americans to vote for that. Polls show people favor [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=736.12s)]
*  that. And if they were deporting people back to their home country, none of this [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=740.56s)]
*  would be an issue. But when you change that to something far more radical, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=745.76s)]
*  sending people based on interpretations of their tattoos or the flimsiest [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=751.6400000000001s)]
*  evidence that you haven't even presented to a court, and you accuse people of [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=757.12s)]
*  being violent criminals and send them to a prison designed to be one of the worst [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  and most destructive and humiliating and dehumanizing prisons in the entire world [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=766.96s)]
*  where the El Salvadorian government has said they may never leave, they may be [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=771.5600000000001s)]
*  here for life. Not just basic human rights, but our Constitution, our laws, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=774.72s)]
*  our precedent, as all three judges agreed, including the Trump appointed judge, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=781.48s)]
*  require that they be given an opportunity to contest the charges [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  against them. This should not even be controversial. And yet it has become such [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=789.08s)]
*  because if you sufficiently dehumanize people, and this is what we saw in the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=794.84s)]
*  world war on terror, if the government just labels them terrorists without [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  proving it, even if it's wrong, enough people will say, oh, these people are [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=802.76s)]
*  animals. They're not even humans. They deserve no rights. Kill them, torture [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=806.32s)]
*  them, kidnap them, put them in prison for life. They don't need a trial. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=808.96s)]
*  And that is always what the founders feared most was that the government [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=813.2800000000001s)]
*  would raise the fear level sufficiently so that people would give away their [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=817.44s)]
*  own liberties. Remember Benjamin Franklin? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=820.6800000000001s)]
*  And this is an apocryphal. This is documented when he left the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  Constitutional Convention, was asked by a woman, what is it that you did in [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=826.44s)]
*  there? And he said, we created a republic if you can keep it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=829.08s)]
*  Knowing that the biggest danger to the Bill of Rights would be that citizens, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  the population, would be manipulated or fear mongered into giving up those [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=837.4s)]
*  rights. And that's what typically happens. We see this all the time and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=841.48s)]
*  that's what's happening now. And now the appellate court, it's not just one [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=845.68s)]
*  judge, it's a three judge appellate court, has ruled that doing this without [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=848.84s)]
*  a hearing or even invoking the law to justify it is likely to fail on the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=853.4s)]
*  merits and therefore these deportations are still enjoined not by one judge but [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=859.24s)]
*  by a three judge panel. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ6q33J9Uu8&t=864.0s)]
