# Warmongers & "America First" Frauds EXPOSED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo)
*  Let us look now at Michael's interview with Howard Lutnick, who I believe is the... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=0.0s)]
*  Actually, no, we're going to look first at his interview. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=13.92s)]
*  It's just a minute and a half with Jamie Harrison, who is the chairman of the Democratic National [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=16.56s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=20.68s)]
*  Jamie Harrison, as you might recall, was a very vocal defender of Joe Biden's right to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=21.68s)]
*  stay in the race, of the fact that Joe Biden should stay in the race until more powerful [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=26.58s)]
*  people than he decided that Biden shouldn't. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  And now he's, of course, a very blind booster of Kamala Harris. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=34.56s)]
*  And here's the exchange that those two had. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=39.66s)]
*  Chairman Harris, I recall you very staunchly defending Joe Biden, remaining his nominee [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=43.58s)]
*  back when there was controversy over whether he should stay in that role. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=48.34s)]
*  Do you regret so strongly standing? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=52.58s)]
*  Why would I regret supporting the guy who's probably the most accomplished legislative [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=56.3s)]
*  president that we've had in my lifetime? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=60.3s)]
*  Because a lot of the Democrats, Democratic Party decided that he was not cognitively [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=62.82s)]
*  fit to remain as president for four years. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=66.62s)]
*  That's a bunch of BS. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=68.7s)]
*  Why did they want to remove him? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=69.7s)]
*  In the end of the day, this is the situation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=71.42s)]
*  If you take a look at Joe Biden's legislative record, compare it to anybody else. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=74.58s)]
*  Compare it to Donald Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=80.14s)]
*  Did Donald Trump do anything compared to Joe Biden in terms of the legislative achievements, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=81.62s)]
*  given what he got? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=86.1s)]
*  Then why did so many Democratic donors, people want to remove him? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=87.1s)]
*  Regardless of what donors wanted or whatever. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=89.86s)]
*  Well, they got their way, didn't they? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=93.14s)]
*  Biden, in the end of the day, made a decision about what he wanted to do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=94.58s)]
*  And he believed, probably the most selfless act in American politics ever, to have the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=98.22s)]
*  greatest gavel of power and to give that up to the next generation to move forward. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=103.34s)]
*  Donald Trump, Donald Trump, his vice president, who was trying to protect democracy, and he [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=110.02s)]
*  was willing to let his vice president risk his life in order to do that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=117.14s)]
*  Selfishness versus selflessness. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  I'm proud of Joe Biden each and every day and will always have his back. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=123.94s)]
*  So Biden had to go. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  Sorry, my bad. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  I love the conceit that Joe Biden voluntarily left the race in an act of noble self-sacrifice [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  because he wanted to pass the torch to the new generation, the 60-year-old Kamala Harris. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=138.66s)]
*  We all watch that play out in real time when Biden was like, I'm not leaving under any [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=147.1s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=151.66s)]
*  I don't want to leave. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=152.66s)]
*  I'm furious at the people who are trying to make me. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=153.66s)]
*  And we all know that Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama and the Democratic donors increasingly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=155.22s)]
*  threatened him to basically suffocate him and do worse to him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=159.3s)]
*  If he didn't leave the race, Nancy Pelosi notoriously said to him, we can either do [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=163.1s)]
*  this the easy way or the hard way, but either way it's going to happen that you're going [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=167.18s)]
*  to be leaving. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=170.94s)]
*  And then the minute they forced him out against his will by threatening him repeatedly, they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=172.46s)]
*  then turn around and have you audacity to say, oh no, he left voluntarily because he's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=177.66s)]
*  such a man of great character and sacrifice. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=181.9s)]
*  He sacrificed his own power for the sake of the nation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  He was desperate to be reelected and serve until he was 86, knowing that his brain was [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  barely functional. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=192.06s)]
*  How desperate he was to cling to the levers of power. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=193.3s)]
*  Here is Michael's interview with Howard Lutnick, who is essentially the person who is going [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=197.22s)]
*  to lead the Trump transition into Trump's second turn if he wins the election. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  For Donald Trump and JD Vance. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=209.34s)]
*  Give us a sense of what your prognosis is in the national security and defense sphere [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=210.98s)]
*  in terms of personnel, maybe also policy insofar as you can convey what Linda McMahon has been [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=216.94s)]
*  up to. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=223.26s)]
*  Is it still going to be emphasis on increasing defense spending? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=225.05999999999997s)]
*  Elements of the Republican Party are skeptical of what they call the military industrial [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=230.82s)]
*  complex in a disparaging way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=233.54s)]
*  Other elements of the party may be more favorable toward that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=236.1s)]
*  How is that tension being navigated if it is in your work thus far? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=240.14s)]
*  So we bring in talent, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=246.14s)]
*  So how does it go? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  People with deep, deep national security experience, people with deep, deep defense experience. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=250.34s)]
*  Give us some examples. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=256.14s)]
*  No. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=257.14s)]
*  Why not? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=258.14s)]
*  Because that's not the way it works. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=259.14s)]
*  The way it works is I build basically the way I say it is a mosaic of talent and the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=260.74s)]
*  President of the United States is going to choose from that mosaic of talent. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=267.06s)]
*  So that's my job. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=271.14s)]
*  But you think about it, we have technology, huge focus on the capacity to improve the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=272.5s)]
*  technology of the U.S. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=277.74s)]
*  People who have vast experience across his first administration in business, the prior [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=279.68s)]
*  administrations, I mean they're all coming. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=286.12s)]
*  Is Jared Kushner coming back? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=288.56s)]
*  I don't comment on people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  I told you that's not it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=291.8s)]
*  But Jared Kushner is a big help to me. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=293.32s)]
*  He's actively helping you on this project? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=295.72s)]
*  He's absolutely actively helping me because everybody's helping me. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=299.0s)]
*  JD Vance is helping me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=303.32s)]
*  Everybody's helping find the most talented people they have and they are recommending [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=305.04s)]
*  them to serve in the government and everybody, how about this, everybody who serves in the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=309.72s)]
*  Trump government will have been vouched for by some world class talented person who says [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=313.8s)]
*  this person we have confidence in will do a great job in the government and that is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=320.8s)]
*  just... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  If you find that reassuring, I'm happy for you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  It's kind of strange for the person in charge of the Trump transition to say that, oh, we [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=331.42s)]
*  don't care about ideology in terms of has the United States been pursuing too many wars? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=336.94s)]
*  Are we too involved in the Middle East? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=344.3s)]
*  All the things that Trump said were his priority in 2016. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=345.70000000000005s)]
*  He's actually saying, no, we're going to take people from the deepest bowels of the deep [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=349.98s)]
*  state of the U.S. security state with all that experience in foreign policy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=353.14s)]
*  People like Mike Pompeo, Jared Kushner, he's helping. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=356.54s)]
*  And if you look at the Trump campaign and the foreign policy dogma he's asserting, the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=361.98s)]
*  promises he's making to people like Maryam Edelson who are giving him a hundred million [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  dollars and her only political priority is that the U.S. do everything possible to defend [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=373.94s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=378.46000000000004s)]
*  To people who he surrounded himself with, it sounds a lot like a more traditional Republican [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=380.06s)]
*  campaign certainly as compared to 2016. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=388.94s)]
*  The one pushback against that is that people close to him succeeded in convincing him to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=391.62s)]
*  choose JD Vance instead of say Mark Rubio or Tim Scott or some other standard Republican [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=397.06s)]
*  who at least does have that populism on both economics and foreign policy that shaped and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  I think was responsible for the success of the Trump 2016 campaign. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=408.14000000000004s)]
*  But the question that Mike asked was how are you navigating this conflict between the Republican [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  establishment's views on foreign policy on the one hand and the people in the party who [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=416.70000000000005s)]
*  want to put America first and don't want the U.S. involved in countless wars, wars for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=420.38000000000005s)]
*  other countries in the Middle East and Ukraine. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=424.42s)]
*  And he wasn't saying, oh, we're going to follow Donald Trump's vision. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=427.70000000000005s)]
*  We're saying, oh, no, we're just going to get the best people around him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=430.38s)]
*  Nikki Haley with all her foreign policy experience who was the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=433.7s)]
*  the Trump administration or people like John Bolton. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=440.02s)]
*  He has a lot of experience as well. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=442.5s)]
*  So I find that disturbing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=444.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=445.7s)]
*  We have a bunch more including interviews with multiple members of Congress that being [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=446.7s)]
*  a Michael Tracy interview are well worth watching. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=451.14s)]
*  But we're just going to have time to show you one more on the live show. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  We'll put the rest of them on our local's platform. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=456.5s)]
*  Here is Michael interviewing the Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik who led the way [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=459.38s)]
*  in getting the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania fired for their [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=464.46s)]
*  refusal to promise to limit the speech of Israel critics on their campus. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=470.9s)]
*  Here is his interview with her. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=476.42s)]
*  So tonight the very first exchange was about Israel and obviously the events of today with [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=478.78s)]
*  Iran firing the salvo of missiles into Israel. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=484.98s)]
*  J.D. Vance says some of the effect of look Israel should be able to do whatever it decides [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=487.66s)]
*  is correct but wouldn't the U.S. inevitably be involved in whatever military operation [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=492.14s)]
*  Israel might undertake against Iran whether it's supplying the armaments or the intelligence [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=498.18s)]
*  or diplomatic backing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=503.38s)]
*  Doesn't the U.S. have a role in weighing in on whether it might be worth entangling the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=505.74s)]
*  U.S. in some kind of retaliatory strike against Iran. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  Well J.D. Vance was correct in to say that Israel has the right to defend itself. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  Israel has been under attack. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=518.7800000000001s)]
*  Its very existence has been under attack by Iran directly in the unprecedented hypersonic [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=520.26s)]
*  ballistic missiles that were launched from Iranian soil to Israel today and it has been [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=525.34s)]
*  under attack through Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=530.26s)]
*  Of course U.S. resources when it comes to our critical military aid to Israel when it [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=534.26s)]
*  comes to our funding for Iron Dome that is an overwhelming support including from J.D. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=538.9000000000001s)]
*  Vance and most importantly President Trump but we voted to pass that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=543.26s)]
*  But the reality is it's the Biden administration Kamala Harris who not only slow walked that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=547.02s)]
*  military aid but have been turning their backs at every opportunity demanding a ceasefire [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=551.62s)]
*  and not wanting to allow Israel to defend itself. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=556.74s)]
*  I believe Israel should defend itself and certainly those are the policies of President [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=560.58s)]
*  Trump. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  Hasn't the Biden Harris administration supplied more military resources to Israel than any [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=564.8199999999999s)]
*  administration ever. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=569.9399999999999s)]
*  United States Congress forced that through. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=571.34s)]
*  Joe Biden slow walked it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=574.02s)]
*  Kamala Harris slow walked it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=575.58s)]
*  So it's because of the leadership of the United States Congress. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=577.34s)]
*  Don't forget there were multiple veto threats that were issued by Joe Biden when we passed [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=579.6600000000001s)]
*  the Israel military aid not once not twice two veto threats and it was only when it was [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=584.02s)]
*  combined in a package of other priorities for the Biden administration. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=588.7s)]
*  So no at every opportunity they have blocked critical military aid to Israel at the most [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=592.4200000000001s)]
*  significant time of need. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=597.86s)]
*  So would you like to what you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=599.78s)]
*  None of that is true. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=603.3399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely none of that is true. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=604.3399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden went to Tel Aviv the week after October 7th and stood with Netanyahu and vowed [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=606.4599999999999s)]
*  as he's done his entire career to give the Israelis every last thing they want. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=612.8199999999999s)]
*  Every weapon every bomb every amount of money that the Israelis have demanded the Biden [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=617.38s)]
*  administration has given them. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=623.38s)]
*  There's been no slow walking of anything. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=625.18s)]
*  The Israelis are drowning in American bombs and American weapons and American money because [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=627.82s)]
*  both political parties in Washington are fully behind that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=633.1800000000001s)]
*  And it is amazing sometimes to me that Donald Trump ran on a platform of America first. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=638.46s)]
*  Think about what that means. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=644.22s)]
*  America first. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=645.22s)]
*  We put our own country our own communities our own citizens and their needs above those [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=646.22s)]
*  of foreign countries. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=651.7800000000001s)]
*  And yet if you listen to the Republicans who are in greatest proximity to Donald Trump [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=652.9000000000001s)]
*  and Elise Stefanik is absolutely one of them. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=657.7s)]
*  She was talked about as potential vice president. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=659.3s)]
*  Their critique of the Democratic Party is oh we're not not that we're giving too much [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=661.72s)]
*  to Ukraine we're giving too much to Israel. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=664.98s)]
*  It's that oh they haven't given enough. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=667.26s)]
*  They should have given more to Ukraine. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=669.62s)]
*  They should have given more arms to Ukraine. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=671.42s)]
*  They should be giving more to Israel. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=672.82s)]
*  It is basically saying we should be doing what Dick Cheney and and and George Bush were [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=675.58s)]
*  doing which is involving U.S. military and essentially every spot around the world in [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=680.7s)]
*  order to assure our dominance through the use of military force. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=685.86s)]
*  And that's where our resources should be going. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=689.02s)]
*  And not only was that message is that message different from the message on which Donald [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=691.26s)]
*  Trump ran and won in 2016 it's essentially the exact opposite leading to a very significant [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=696.58s)]
*  question and doubt about which Donald Trump will actually appear and which will be expressed [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=701.54s)]
*  in the event that he wins. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELbDxzT0Eo&t=706.76s)]
