# Yale Fascism Professor Dramatically FLEES THE U.S.
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8)
*  There is this remarkable and darkly hilarious and blatantly pathetic trend that's going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=0.0s)]
*  on every four years for as long as I can remember. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=14.58s)]
*  You have all these elites, celebrities and the like, you say, oh, if George Bush wins, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=19.64s)]
*  if John McCain wins, if Mitt Romney wins, I'm leaving the United States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=24.48s)]
*  2016, I'm leaving the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=29.8s)]
*  They never do, even when the Republicans win, even though they say they're going to, they [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=31.96s)]
*  sit right in the United States. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=35.24s)]
*  Finally, in the second victory, Donald Trump, there were actually a few people who did leave [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=37.2s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=42.16s)]
*  Ellen DeGeneres moved to London. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=43.16s)]
*  Rosie O'Donnell went to Ireland. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=47.96s)]
*  So at least they're carrying through on this, but these are celebrities who aren't even [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=51.28s)]
*  worth mocking. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=55.92s)]
*  What is worth looking at is the fact that you have these self-identified experts, these [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=57.96s)]
*  honored, heralded experts in the highest levels of American academia who are also now fleeing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=65.48s)]
*  America, they say, because it's not safe for them to stay any longer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=73.28s)]
*  One of them is the Yale professor, Jason Stanley, who really just became a laughingstock [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=79.16s)]
*  the more he exposed himself on X. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they have these lofty titles at Yale, the chair, the founded, funded, named chair [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=88.12s)]
*  that they hold. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=96.3s)]
*  Everything is designed to elevate their stature and their prestige and their intellectual [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=97.3s)]
*  elevation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  And then they go on to X and they just realize what complete morons these people are. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  It's politically been all in every way, totally on board with Russiagate. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=108.52s)]
*  So he's one of them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=113.88s)]
*  His fellow Yale professor, Timothy Snyder, who became pretty much the academic hero of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=115.06s)]
*  American liberals because he was extremely enthusiastic about Russiagate. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=121.64s)]
*  He's an absolute fanatic about funding the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=127.52s)]
*  He thinks Trump is in bed with Putin. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=130.2s)]
*  And he wrote this book on tyranny that liberals think is the guidebook for how you avoid the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=132.88s)]
*  authoritarianism and tyranny of Donald Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=140.64s)]
*  And then his wife, who is also a senior professor at Yale, all three of them are together fleeing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=142.68s)]
*  the United States to Canada. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=152.48s)]
*  And they're saying they're fleeing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=153.84s)]
*  It's not like they just got a job at another university. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=154.84s)]
*  They did get a job in a Canadian university, but they're saying we're leaving because [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=157.72s)]
*  we fear America. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=161.84s)]
*  We don't feel safe. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=164.04s)]
*  These very protected, lofty, extremely wealthy, celebrated academics don't feel safe. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=165.56s)]
*  Obviously, there are people whose civil liberties are a threat. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=173.04s)]
*  We've been covering them a lot. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=176.88s)]
*  It's not wealthy, shielded, coddled, highly credentialed Yale professors. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=177.92s)]
*  And if you're going to make a career out of saying, oh, I'm a fascism expert. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to teach you how to fight Trump's authoritarianism. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  You should be the last person running away and fleeing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=190.8s)]
*  You've told people stay and fight. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=193.08s)]
*  That's how you got rich. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=194.56s)]
*  You wrote a book saying the key is to disobey, defy them, stay and fight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  And now not even two months into the administration, you're admittedly fleeing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=200.68s)]
*  And of course, they get it glamorous right up in Vanity Fair. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=204.68s)]
*  Hear from Vanity Fair on Monday. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  The fascism expert at Yale who's fleeing America. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Quote, philosophy professor Jason Stanley is leaving the US for Canada. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=216.68s)]
*  Can we put that up? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=222.8s)]
*  The philosophy professor Jason Stanley is leaving the US for Canada. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  Yes, sub-headline. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=233.16s)]
*  So it says, Vanity Fair says, philosophy professor Jason Stanley [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=234.0s)]
*  is leaving the US for Canada, which he calls, quote, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  the Ukraine of North America. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  Because he believes Trump's America is, quote, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=243.72s)]
*  pretty far along in the grips of fascism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=245.6s)]
*  Here's what the interviewer asked. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=250.48s)]
*  She says, I'm a dual Canadian citizen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=251.8s)]
*  I went to high school in Canada. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=254.72s)]
*  My family's there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=256.0s)]
*  I don't think I personally have witnessed anything like the tension [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=256.88s)]
*  between the two countries that I'm seeing now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=259.6s)]
*  What do you think Canada's role in all of this will be? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=261.72s)]
*  And then Professor Stanley, the philosophy professor at Yale, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=263.96s)]
*  says, Canada is going to be at the forefront because they're being squarely [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=267.2s)]
*  targeted by the United States. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=270.48s)]
*  So just like Ukraine is squarely targeted by Russia, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=271.84s)]
*  Canada is the Ukraine of North America right now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=276.32s)]
*  We, meaning the United States, are a fascist regime, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=279.2s)]
*  so we can't tolerate a free democracy next to us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=281.32s)]
*  Canada is going to be like Ukraine, except they [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  don't have the Ukrainian army. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump has said he's not going to use the military against Canada. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  And I actually believe that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=290.2s)]
*  But he's going to relentlessly target Canada. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=291.32s)]
*  And he talks about how his close friend, Timothy Snyder, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=294.08s)]
*  is going with him, along with his wife, who, to be frank, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=296.88s)]
*  I don't recall her name, but she's a celebrated professor at Yale as well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=303.04s)]
*  What is it? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=307.76s)]
*  Marcy Shore, exactly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=309.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=310.52s)]
*  Now, here is an excerpt of Timothy Snyder's book on tyranny, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=312.12s)]
*  which has become a massive bestseller. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=317.4s)]
*  He's made millions of dollars on this book because he wrote it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=319.04s)]
*  It came out in April 2017. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=321.96s)]
*  It was obviously about Trump. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=323.4s)]
*  I'm the academic expert, the historian, and the expert on tyranny. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=325.28s)]
*  And here I am to tell you that Trump is a tyrant. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=330.44s)]
*  Authoritarianism is coming. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  And here's how you have to resist it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  The title, resist authoritarianism by refusing to obey in advance. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=336.64s)]
*  Timothy Snyder takes us from Nazism in Austria [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=340.67999999999995s)]
*  to the Milgram experiment. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  Quote, this is Snyder from his book. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  Do not obey in advance. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  In times like these, individuals think ahead [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=352.88s)]
*  about what a more repressive government will want [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=355.04s)]
*  and then offer themselves without being asked. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=357.28s)]
*  A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=359.28s)]
*  Now, in fairness, a lot of people are suggesting [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  that it's really his wife who's demanding that they flee [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  and he's just going with her. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=371.48s)]
*  But it's this trio. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=373.2s)]
*  And Jason says, oh, yeah, they're my best friends, those two. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=374.4s)]
*  We're all fleeing together. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=377.32s)]
*  After you read a book telling other people, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=379.0s)]
*  stand your ground and fight. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  Don't give in ahead of time because that's what teaches them [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  that they can go further. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  And here he is fleeing the country, not fighting anything. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=387.08s)]
*  No one's even targeted him. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  No one's even interested in him. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=390.0s)]
*  Like if, you know, the FBI starts zooming around [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=393.52s)]
*  and hears he's about to re-arrest, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=396.2s)]
*  then okay, flee the country. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=397.32s)]
*  But no one's even remotely suggesting that's going to happen. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  And they're the first ones out. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=401.92s)]
*  In case you don't know who Jason Stanley is, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=403.72s)]
*  let me show you this promo video of him talking about himself. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=407.76s)]
*  It'll really give you a good sense of who this heroic, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=414.56s)]
*  self-exiled dissident is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=417.76s)]
*  My name is Jason Stanley. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=420.2s)]
*  I'm the Jacob Yurovsky Professor of Philosophy [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=421.64s)]
*  at Yale University. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=424.2s)]

*  Do you see how we almost forgot to add that? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=448.04s)]
*  It's so crucial to his identity, and then he corrected it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=450.04s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm a teacher in the philosophy department [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=453.08000000000004s)]

*  at Yale University. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=464.08s)]
*  I'm the author of five books, most recently, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  How Fascism Works, The Politics of Us and Them. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=468.52s)]
*  What is success? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=472.88s)]
*  You can be successful at many things. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=474.52s)]
*  You can be successful at counting blades of grass. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=477.32s)]
*  Is that success? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=481.4s)]
*  It is success. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=483.28s)]
*  I'm the Jacob Yurovsky Professor of Philosophy [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=485.15999999999997s)]

*  How Fascism Works, The Politics of Us and Them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=494.16s)]
*  All right, so do you get a sense of who he is? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=499.48s)]
*  Are you at all surprised that he's fleeing the country [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  thinking he's being persecuted? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  Like I said, I do think there are people [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  whose civil liberties are in danger, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=508.24s)]
*  whose liberty is in danger, but it's not them. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, just as a side note, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=514.08s)]
*  although he loves to, you know, like in academia, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=516.48s)]
*  there's sort of like assistant professor [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  and then associate professor and then full professor, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=522.4000000000001s)]
*  and then you get tenure, but the top is a named chair, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  a named professorship, which comes from people funding [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=530.7600000000001s)]
*  a certain chair or professor, and then you are like the, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=534.5200000000001s)]
*  you know, George Soros Professor of Finance or whatever. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=538.2s)]
*  It's like, it's supposed to be the most prestigious. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=544.36s)]
*  Funny thing is, nobody knows who this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=547.12s)]
*  Jacob Yerosky person is. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  Try and Google them, you can't find anything. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  The only thing that comes up is this person. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=552.48s)]
*  He's apparently some anonymous person who, I guess, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=555.0s)]
*  gave money to Yale for a chair in his name, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=557.64s)]
*  and Jason Stanley is very proud of that, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  but no one even knows who this is. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=562.76s)]
*  But it really shows you this kind of character [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=565.56s)]
*  of the most elite people who love to convince themselves [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  that they're the most endangered. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=572.6s)]
*  There was recently a trailer for a new film [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=575.2s)]
*  produced by Israel supporters, one of whom is [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=579.2s)]
*  the multi-billionaire Facebook mogul Cheryl Sandberg, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=581.6s)]
*  and it's obviously coming out right as Gaza is being destroyed [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=585.76s)]
*  and tens of thousands of children are being killed, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=589.48s)]
*  and it starts off with her saying, on the verge of tears, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=594.2s)]
*  obviously Jews like me are very afraid, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=599.72s)]
*  and I said to my friend, I need to ask you something. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=603.16s)]
*  If it comes down to it, will you hide me? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=607.52s)]
*  Will you hide me? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  And the friend said, what do you mean? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=612.64s)]
*  She wasn't Jewish, the friend. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  And then Cheryl Sandberg explained, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=615.68s)]
*  well, you know, like Anne Frank, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  she was hidden by a non-Jewish family [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  during the Holocaust, will you hide me? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=621.52s)]
*  And then she said, oh, the friend right away [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=623.68s)]
*  knew what I was talking about, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=625.64s)]
*  but if she had been Jewish, she wouldn't have asked, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=626.48s)]
*  she would have known exactly. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=627.88s)]
*  So the person in danger, the person who needs to be hidden, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=628.92s)]
*  the person who has to cry because she's victimized [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  and persecuted is a multi-billionaire Facebook mogul [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  who can, and I'm sure does have, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=643.04s)]
*  her own small army of security and like private islands [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  that she can escape to on her yacht or private plane. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=648.5999999999999s)]
*  And that, there is this tendency for the people [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=651.28s)]
*  who have the most, who have the most security, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=653.76s)]
*  who have the most power to simultaneously want [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=656.04s)]
*  to depict themselves as the most persecuted [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=658.88s)]
*  and endangered victim. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=661.52s)]
*  It's like a power play. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=662.36s)]
*  It's not enough to have all that power. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=663.36s)]
*  You then have to insist that you're simultaneously [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  the ones who are victimized. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=667.24s)]
*  It's a very common psychological dynamic [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=668.88s)]
*  if you look for it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpL9klxw8G8&t=670.4s)]
