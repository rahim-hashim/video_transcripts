# Is Europe TURNING AGAINST Israel?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE)
*  There are reports that countries including the UK and France are preparing to recognize [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestinian statehood, but the US, by contrast, is openly against that, as they have been [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=11.88s)]
*  for many decades. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to some remarks from the US representative at the UN. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  His name is John Kelly. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=25.42s)]
*  And this is what he said about the calls for Palestinian statehood, that essentially, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=27.180000000000003s)]
*  to grant Palestinians a state now would be to reward the attacks of October 7th. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=31.5s)]
*  The United States stands with Israel in unequivocally rejecting any effort to unilaterally recognize [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=37.540000000000006s)]
*  a Palestinian state or impose conditions on Israel which would be an unconscionable reward [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  for the heinous Hamas attack on Israel that massacred and brutally kidnapped Israelis [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=52.68s)]
*  and Americans. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=57.84s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=58.84s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  According to the US, it would be an unconscionable reward to Palestinians to give them a state [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  because October 7th happened. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=67.64s)]
*  Well, I think what he's really trying to say is, once again, expressing the traditional [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=69.52s)]
*  US position, which is that the Palestinian people have no legitimate rights. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=75.36s)]
*  They have no legitimate grievances and they certainly have no right to an existence independent [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=81.32s)]
*  of Israel in the form of a state on what the United States de facto considers Israeli rather [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=87.88s)]
*  than Palestinian territory. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=96.05999999999999s)]
*  I believe it's that simple. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Do you see any countervailing force right now in the region or anywhere around the world, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  whether it's Europe becoming increasingly critical of Israel, talking about recognizing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=105.72s)]
*  Palestinian statehood, or the Gulf states? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=110.16s)]
*  You know, Trump just did a tour of several Gulf countries, talked about making some lavish [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=113.0s)]
*  deals, talked about receiving a gift from Qatar, a very fancy jet. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  But even there, at least publicly, the issue of Gaza did not come up very much. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=123.44s)]
*  Do you see any pressure going on behind the scenes on the US to stop the genocide from [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=127.92s)]
*  some of its allies, whether they're in Europe or the Gulf? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, let's take those one by one. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=137.0s)]
*  In the Gulf, as you will have noticed, the regional priority of the states that Trump [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=139.8s)]
*  visited were not Gaza, but were a lifting of the sanctions on Syria because the Gulf [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  states are very concerned about having another Iraq on their doorstep, referring to the chaos [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  that engulfed Iraq after the 2003 US invasion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=159.08s)]
*  And second of all, of encouraging Trump to continue diplomacy with Iran because they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=164.24s)]
*  recognize that in the event of a direct military confrontation, they will be in the front line [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=169.72s)]
*  and will be paying the highest price of any such conflict. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=175.44s)]
*  And Gaza was, I think, much less of a priority, barely registered in these discussions, except [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=181.52s)]
*  perhaps as a kind of minor issue. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  When we did see the Arab states and not only the Gulf states collectively and loudly and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=195.12s)]
*  very publicly come out in opposition to the United States was in February when Trump proclaimed [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=201.84s)]
*  his harebrained initiative about expelling all the Palestinians to make way for what [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=210.08s)]
*  he called the Gaza Riviera, because that was a fundamental difference. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=214.4s)]
*  Since October 2023, well, for much longer, but particularly since then, Israel has been [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=218.64s)]
*  slaughtering Palestinians in their own homeland. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=225.27999999999997s)]
*  What changed with Trump's proposal was that these Palestinians would be collectively expelled [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=228.55999999999997s)]
*  to the Arab world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  That in contrast to the genocide in Gaza is experienced as a direct threat to their national [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  security, a direct threat of their domestic stability, and a direct threat to what remains [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=243.84s)]
*  of their domestic legitimacy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=252.16s)]
*  And it's for that reason that they stood up and said no. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=255.28s)]
*  And that's why I don't think this proposal is ever going to get off the ground, certainly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=258.24s)]
*  not in the form that it was initially proposed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=263.2s)]
*  Europe is different. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=268.16s)]
*  What we've seen from Europe is a clear and a significant change in tone, but we have [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=270.16s)]
*  seen absolutely no difference in conduct. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=277.84s)]
*  In other words, it's business as usual with the scolding. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=282.08s)]
*  And of course, there are exceptions, Spain, Ireland, Norway. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=287.28s)]
*  But if you look at the European Union, I think it's important to recognize, for example, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=292.4s)]
*  that in 2000, the European Union signed what's known as an association agreement with Israel, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  an agreement that gives Israel preferential trade privileges in Europe. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=303.84s)]
*  It allows Israeli institutions to participate in various European Union research and development [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=310.55999999999995s)]
*  programs as if it were an EU member. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=316.55999999999995s)]
*  And Article 2 of that association agreement makes Israeli compliance with its human rights [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=320.4s)]
*  obligations an essential condition of Israeli participation in this or Israeli access to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=326.8s)]
*  this agreement. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=334.88000000000005s)]
*  That was 25 years ago. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=335.68s)]
*  And until today, the EU has never invoked Article 2. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=337.68s)]
*  In other words, the EU has never determined that Israel is not fulfilling its human rights [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=343.44000000000005s)]
*  obligations. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=349.44000000000005s)]
*  And last week, it's true, the EU announced that it would launch a review to determine [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=350.64s)]
*  whether or not Israel was in compliance with its obligations, meaning that almost two years [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  into a genocide, no one in Brussels knows what's going on, and they have to launch a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=363.68s)]
*  review, which is another way of saying we're going to take our time, do an investigation, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=370.08s)]
*  take even more time to write a report, take even more time to hold discussions about the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=374.8s)]
*  conclusions of this report, then we won't have a majority and we'll just continue with [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=379.2s)]
*  business as usual. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=383.84s)]
*  And even more importantly, as pointed out, for example, by Hugh Lovatt of the European [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  Council on Foreign Relations, a review was already conducted last year, but it wasn't [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  publicly announced. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=395.2s)]
*  It was conducted in secret and it was apparently a very damning report that was never released [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=396.88s)]
*  and never acted upon. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=403.52s)]
*  So, you know, even when we get to issues like France and potentially others declaring that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=405.36s)]
*  they are considering or even intend to recognize Palestinian statehood, well, all well and good. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=412.24s)]
*  But if it's not paired with concrete action to make such a state possible to reverse the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=417.76s)]
*  Israeli occupation of these territories, when you look the other way, when Israel announces 22 new [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=425.92s)]
*  settlements, you know, the occupation started in 1967. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=433.6s)]
*  In 2025, statements that are not accompanied by decisive action are not only meaningless, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=438.56s)]
*  they're worse than meaningless because what they really do is they serve as camouflage [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=445.76000000000005s)]
*  for doing nothing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=451.12s)]
*  And we'll leave it there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJEa0YuUUqE&t=453.6s)]
