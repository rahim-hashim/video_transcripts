# Outrageous NIH Rule Exposes Free Speech FRAUDS
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g)
*  Lee Fong is somebody who for our viewers needs no introduction so I don't know exactly why. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm about to give a short one but he is an independent journalist who is based in San [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=11.36s)]
*  Francisco where he covers political and corporate wrongdoing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=15.72s)]
*  He does a lot of shoelace investigative financial reporting on Substack at LeeFong.com. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=19.44s)]
*  He previously was a reporter for The Intercept where he was my colleague for several years. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  He also worked at The Nation and Vice. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=29.72s)]
*  He has a new article out today on his Substack entitled The Trump Administration Enacts Vast [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Censorship of American Scientists Over Israel which regards to what I mentioned at the top [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  which are these new institute rules from the National Institute of Health that punish medical [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=43.2s)]
*  researchers with a denial of funds unless they're willing to sign a pledge that they [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  do not support or participate in a boycott of Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=54.72s)]
*  Just the latest in a multitude of censorship programs just in three months of the Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=58.96s)]
*  Administration aimed not at protecting American minority groups or American citizens or American [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  interests but protecting this one foreign country called Israel on the other side of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=69.72s)]
*  the world and Lee is with us tonight to talk about his reporting as well as the broader [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=74.16s)]
*  implications Lee. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=77.9s)]
*  Great to see you as always. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=79.0s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=80.0s)]
*  Hey Glenn, great to see you as well. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=81.0s)]
*  Alright so I talked a little bit about these regulations which you've written about but [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  before I get to your article and to your analysis of them I want to show people what the regulations [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=87.8s)]
*  are because a lot of times we talk about regulations people might wonder well is it really as extreme [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=93.28s)]
*  as people are suggesting? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=98.14s)]
*  Is it really so clear that this is what's happening? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=100.44s)]
*  It sounds kind of impossible that the NIH especially now run by Dr. Jay Bhattachara [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=102.94s)]
*  who made his name as a free speech advocate during COVID. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  He himself was censored despite being a medical expert and a scientist at Stanford made a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=111.88s)]
*  big deal out of the importance of free speech as an agency run by Dr. Jay Bhattachara really [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=117.44s)]
*  telling cancer researchers and Alzheimer researchers that they'll lose federal grants if they participate [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  in the boycott of Israel and that they're required to get that money to sign a pledge [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  saying they don't support the boycott of Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  So I just want to show people the relevant part of the regulation and read it to them [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=135.04s)]
*  just so people understand how clear it is. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  So this is the regulation that was issued today. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=140.7s)]
*  It's from the National Institute of Health which is part of the Health and Human Services [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=143.44s)]
*  Agency. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=148.44s)]
*  So it's technically RFK Junior's agency the National Institute of Health often has a lot [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=150.5s)]
*  of autonomy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=156.32s)]
*  It's dated April 21st. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=157.32s)]
*  The title is Notice of Civil Rights Term and Condition of Awards. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Here's the tax policy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=164.84s)]
*  Effective with the issuance of this notice the following term and condition applies. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=166.96s)]
*  Recipients of federal grants must comply with all applicable federal anti-discrimination [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=172.56s)]
*  laws material to the government's payment decisions under the law governing grants. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=178.22s)]
*  The definition as used in this clause, quote, discriminatory prohibited boycotts means refusing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=184.0s)]
*  to deal, cutting commercial relations or otherwise limiting commercial relations specifically [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=190.68s)]
*  with Israeli companies or with companies doing business in or with Israel or authorized by, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=197.28s)]
*  licensed by or organized under the laws of Israel to do business. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=204.12s)]
*  Two, grant certification award certification. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=208.68s)]
*  By accepting the grant award from NIH recipients are certifying that quote one they do not [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=212.0s)]
*  engage in and will not engage in for the term of this award a discriminatory prohibited [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  boycott which was defined to mean boycotting not any country in the world other than Israel, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=223.56s)]
*  just Israel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=228.4s)]
*  And then it says NIH reserves the right to terminate financial assistance awards and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=229.4s)]
*  recover all funds if recipients during the term of this award operate any program in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=234.16s)]
*  violation of federal anti-discrimination laws or engage in a prohibited boycott. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=239.38s)]
*  Now the thing about this Lee that is so amazing to me is that under this NIH rule you can, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=244.56s)]
*  are you eligible to receive major medical grants from NIH, major research grants to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=254.16s)]
*  find cures or treatments for diseases if you boycott any single country in the world on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  the planet except for Israel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=266.76s)]
*  And in fact you're even allowed to boycott American states. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=268.68s)]
*  We've seen boycotts organized politically toward American states over the past 10 years. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=272.28s)]
*  They boycotted Indiana and North Carolina over so-called bathroom bills. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=276.64s)]
*  They boycotted the state of Georgia over their voting rights or their voting laws about [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  voter ID and the like that they compared to Jim Crow. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=285.64s)]
*  They lost all sorts of opportunities. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=287.96s)]
*  You're perfectly allowed to boycott American states. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=290.2s)]
*  You can boycott, in fact you're required to boycott because the government makes you Russia [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=292.96s)]
*  and Cuba and Venezuela and Iran and China. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=297.0s)]
*  You can boycott Peru or Indonesia. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=300.28s)]
*  You can boycott Uruguay or Norway. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=302.26s)]
*  You just can't boycott the state of Israel if you want to receive federal funding for [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=305.3s)]
*  conducting medical research to find cures and treatments for diseases. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  Do I have that right based on the language of the policy? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I believe you do Glenn. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=318.3s)]
*  Just look at the last 10, 20 years of political advocacy at universities and colleges around [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  the country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=328.74s)]
*  Oftentimes the ways that students or faculty attempt to express their concerns around [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=329.74s)]
*  policies around the world, whether that's human rights suppression in China or Russia, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=336.3s)]
*  gun rights laws in the South, LGBT laws as you mentioned in Indiana and North Carolina, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=343.14s)]
*  really a litany of other perceived and very real abuses is to pressure a university and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  to discuss policies around divestment and boycotting that the university through its [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=356.82s)]
*  pension fund should remove its investments from companies doing businesses in those [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=362.98s)]
*  jurisdictions or that businesses engaged in alleged human rights abuses or other reported [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=367.26s)]
*  violations should be boycotted in some way. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=374.92s)]
*  The university should no longer purchase goods from that company or should revoke some type [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=378.7s)]
*  of contract with that business. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=383.96s)]
*  This is very normal and routine. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=385.68s)]
*  We've seen it on the left and right and we've seen it all across the country on many different [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=388.72s)]
*  jurisdictions as you mentioned. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=392.96s)]
*  What these rules, the NIH rules do is that they prohibit only one form of boycott, only [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=395.2s)]
*  one form of divestment and that is against the state of Israel. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  Over the last 10 years since 2015, we've seen a number of state legislatures enact very [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=405.3s)]
*  similar laws, the so-called anti-BDS bills. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=410.44s)]
*  Now I believe 37 or 38 states have enacted these since 2015 and these laws prevent government [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=414.12s)]
*  contractors from engaging in boycotts or divestment or similar protests of the state of Israel [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=420.32s)]
*  from engaging in state commerce with those states that enacted those laws. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=426.72s)]
*  Many have been challenged in court as a suppression of First Amendment rights. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=432.32s)]
*  But these NIH rules that were released last night and are now enacted nationally, the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=437.64s)]
*  NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world, really touches every corner [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=444.28s)]
*  of our research institutes, almost every major university, every major kind of medicine and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=449.96s)]
*  other kind of biomedical research effort. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=456.24s)]
*  These rules are going to apply to any organization that currently has grants or is seeking grants [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=459.74s)]
*  with the NIH by certifying that they are complying with these newly redefined civil rights rules. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=465.8s)]
*  That means they're going to have to police their own employees and carefully watch any [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=472.76000000000005s)]
*  of their kind of researchers or people who work at their institution from not running [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  afoul of these rules. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=481.38000000000005s)]
*  I want to note that the kind of legal code that's attached to this civil rights announcement, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  that's the False Claims Act. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=489.48s)]
*  So folks who are found in violation of this certification, they could face civil and criminal [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=490.84s)]
*  penalties for running afoul of these boycotting rules. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I do want to note, you're right, that this has been going on for years without a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=500.94s)]
*  lot of notice in the United States. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=505.78s)]
*  It's been mostly red states due to a variety of reasons that have enacted these unbelievable [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=507.7s)]
*  laws that say as a condition for having a contract with the state, you can be like, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=514.14s)]
*  a small builder and some local commission wants to hire you to repair a building. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=521.7s)]
*  You can be, and this is a case that I reported on, a contractor, a speech pathologist who [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=527.74s)]
*  works with speech deficiencies for young children. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=533.7s)]
*  If you want to have that contract, if you want to continue with your contract employment, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=537.52s)]
*  you have to sign a loyalty oath, a certification promising that you will not support or participate [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=541.1s)]
*  in a boycott of Israel. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=547.3s)]
*  And the first case that I ever reported on was this woman, she was a speech pathologist. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=549.22s)]
*  She specialized in certain languages in the Austin School District that very few speech [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=553.98s)]
*  pathologists had expertise in in terms of helping native speakers who were learning [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=560.1800000000001s)]

*  the occupation of the West Bank. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=579.78s)]
*  It was a totally peaceful form of protest against Israel. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=581.66s)]
*  People are saying, why do Palestinians use violence? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=584.0999999999999s)]
*  You can debate whether they have the right to as an occupied people, but this is a nonviolent [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=587.14s)]
*  form of protest. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=591.2199999999999s)]

*  Conservatives boycotted Bud Light and all sorts of other companies if they felt like [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=594.02s)]

*  One of the things, the examples that I've always found most amazingly, and I've tried [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=616.2399999999999s)]

*  Andrew Cuomo, when he was the governor of New York, and I think we have this on the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=625.6199999999999s)]

*  of North Carolina. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=637.5s)]
*  He forbade any travel to North Carolina or to Indiana. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=638.5s)]
*  These are not foreign countries. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=642.9s)]
*  These are American states. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=643.9799999999999s)]
*  Based on his attempt and desire to participate in the boycott of those states for having [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=646.42s)]
*  passed bathroom bills saying people have to use the bathroom that corresponds to their [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=651.8599999999999s)]
*  biological gender and they can't use any other bathroom. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=656.3s)]
*  There was a boycott organized of Indiana and North Carolina. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=660.62s)]
*  He mandated that the entire state avoid any contribution of resources to those states. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=663.74s)]
*  He then turned around months later and announced that anyone who boycotts Israel will be prohibited [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=670.74s)]
*  from having contracts with New York state. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=678.82s)]
*  He wrote this op-ed in the Washington Post, Governor Andrew Cuomo, if you boycott Israel, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=681.38s)]
*  New York state will boycott you. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=686.1800000000001s)]

*  for any American citizen, not producing enormous amounts of outrage that under the law and [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=694.3s)]
*  under government policy, you are able to participate in the boycott of your fellow citizens, your [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=701.98s)]
*  own country, the states within the United States. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=709.38s)]
*  The one thing that you cannot do is participate in a boycott against this one foreign country [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=712.5799999999999s)]
*  called Israel. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=717.66s)]
*  Well, this is just part of a wave of suppression of speech and activism around Israel. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=720.3s)]
*  There are forces, pro-Israel forces, and this is not just coming from the pro-Israel Jewish [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=727.3399999999999s)]
*  community. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=734.8199999999999s)]
*  There are many Christian, Zionist groups that are very in support of Israel, but in any [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=735.8199999999999s)]
*  case very powerful advocacy groups that have pushed the government in this direction. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=739.8199999999999s)]
*  They support Israel. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=744.74s)]
*  They want lockstep support of Israeli policies and Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=746.1s)]
*  They can't tolerate any dissent. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=751.58s)]
*  That's why we've seen a wave of laws over the last few years passing the IHRA, which [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=753.62s)]
*  redefines anti-Semitism to include a number of provisions, one of which is describing [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=759.86s)]
*  the state of Israel as racist, that can now land you into some prison time in some states [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=765.28s)]
*  because they've updated the hate speech codes in places like Georgia and Arizona, and they've [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=772.42s)]
*  attempted to pass federal legislation to that effect as well. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=777.2199999999999s)]
*  They've attempted to encode the IHRA into the speech codes at various universities, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=780.78s)]
*  including Harvard University, which actually accepted the proposal from pro-Israel advocates [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=785.66s)]
*  and the Trump administration despite the very well publicized fights they have with the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=790.2199999999999s)]
*  administration. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=794.26s)]
*  They've actually accepted that change to their campus policy. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=795.26s)]
*  You look just across the board. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=800.82s)]
*  The fact that they are taking legal foreign students, people who are here on a green card, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=804.0200000000001s)]
*  who are getting their PhD or a graduate degree, who have engaged in nonviolent protests or [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=809.86s)]
*  simply writing a column in their student newspaper criticizing Israel and calling for their university [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=815.0600000000001s)]
*  to divest from Israel, people like that have now been abducted from the streets by ICE [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=821.4000000000001s)]
*  agents and are now sitting in a cage in Louisiana where it's simply engaging in speech that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=826.24s)]
*  is critical of Israel. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=832.72s)]
*  For folks who are watching these ICE abductions of students over Israel criticism in the last [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=834.08s)]
*  month, the slope is incredibly slippery. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=840.08s)]
*  Now we're having this NIH announcement that is really radically changing the definition [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=845.32s)]
*  of our civil rights codes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=851.36s)]
*  Instead of having them simply based on non-discrimination on the basis of race or gender or something [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=853.12s)]
*  along those lines, it's now redefined to say, oh, if you engage in a boycott of Israel, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=860.42s)]
*  entire universities, entire laboratories, entire research institutes are going to be [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=865.92s)]
*  cut off from NIH funding. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=870.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=872.64s)]
*  I think it's worth noting just like with the focus on these foreign students and Mahmoud [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=873.64s)]
*  Khalil, who was in the United States legally, is married to an American woman, had a green [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=880.24s)]
*  card, was not accused of breaking any laws, was never arrested, never charged with any [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=886.36s)]
*  crimes. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=890.4s)]
*  His wife gave birth yesterday and he asked permission to be present for the birth of [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=891.4s)]
*  his first child who's an American child who is being born to an American woman and ICE [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=895.56s)]
*  within 23 minutes of his request barred him from doing so. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=902.4s)]
*  So there's a lot of vengeance against people who committed the crime of criticizing Israel. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=906.28s)]
*  But a lot of the focus has been on foreign students, but the reality is that these speech [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=912.04s)]
*  codes like the ones that you mentioned, these expanded speech codes are now being imposed [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=916.72s)]
*  on American universities at the demand of the Trump administration saying, if you don't [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=921.34s)]
*  want to lose your federal funding, you're going to implement these expanded definitions [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=926.96s)]
*  of anti-Semitism that preclude, as you said, people from engaging in all sorts of common [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=931.76s)]
*  criticism of Israel. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  You can't say Israel is a racist endeavor. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=937.3199999999999s)]
*  You can't compare it to the actions of the Nazis. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=939.6s)]
*  Huge numbers of common criticism that are now outlawed by a movement that was elected [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=942.64s)]
*  based on a promise to restore free speech. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=947.4s)]
*  And these speech codes don't just apply to foreign students, they apply to American students [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=950.08s)]
*  and American faculty. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=953.6s)]
*  They're a war on academic freedom. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=954.6s)]
*  I want to show you one of the two tweets that RFK Jr. posted to Axe shortly after being [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=957.2800000000001s)]
*  confirmed as HHS secretary because, you know, RFK Jr. ran for president on a platform of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=968.8000000000001s)]
*  improving American health, of getting additives and chemicals out of our diets, of no longer [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=975.2800000000001s)]
*  having our FDA process captured by big pharma. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=983.44s)]
*  A lot of, I think, noble and well-intentioned promises that he made about what he wanted [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=987.2s)]
*  to do as HHS secretary in order to improve American health. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=992.44s)]
*  He's in office for about six seconds and two of his first tweets are designed to claim [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=996.44s)]
*  that one of the gravest health problems that America faces is anti-Semitism in general [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1002.24s)]
*  and anti-Semitism in particular on American colleges and that health and human services [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1007.7600000000001s)]
*  will be devoted to cleansing anti-Semitism and purging it from our schools in order [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1012.92s)]
*  to improve health. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1017.92s)]
*  Here's what he tweeted on March 3rd. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1018.92s)]
*  Quote, anti-Semitism, like racism, is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1021.92s)]
*  kills people with lethalities comparable to history's most deadly plagues. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1029.04s)]
*  In recent years, the censorship and false narratives of world cancel culture have transformed [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  our great universities into greenhouses for this deadly and virulent pestilence. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1038.16s)]
*  Making America healthy means building communities of trust and mutual respect based on speech [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1044.24s)]
*  freedom and open debate, which very quickly translated into punishing people who criticize [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1049.6200000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1058.96s)]
*  Do you think that these kinds of policies, and I heard from people who know Jay Bhattacharya [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1060.5600000000002s)]
*  very well because he is the head of the National Institutes of Health that issued these regulations [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1066.76s)]
*  who insist that this did not come from his initiative, that this is not something he [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1070.92s)]
*  got into office. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1076.0s)]
*  He's only been the head of the NIH for I think less than a month now, that this was sort [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1077.0s)]
*  of coming from an administration-wide pressure campaign to demand that all agencies do something [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1081.46s)]
*  to restrict the expression of anti-Semitism. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1087.68s)]
*  What do you make of the political kind of pressures that are producing this avalanche [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1091.36s)]
*  of free speech attacks about this one issue in such a short period of time? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1097.2s)]
*  Look, the Seventh Eye, an Israeli investigative news outlet based in Israel, engaged in the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1101.28s)]
*  equivalent of Freedom of Information Act requests, public document requests, litigation against [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1109.92s)]
*  the government of Israel to obtain internal documents. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1115.48s)]
*  They eventually succeeded and obtained hundreds of documents that show that since 2017, the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1118.48s)]
*  Israeli government has poured millions of dollars into a secret effort to pass the original [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1125.2s)]
*  anti-BDS laws in state legislatures. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1130.84s)]
*  I mean, it's really well documented that they were sending money through various proxy groups [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1133.56s)]
*  to groups like the Israel Allies Foundation, which included some of the very first state [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1138.8s)]
*  legislators who passed these laws. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1142.72s)]
*  Not only that, they were inviting those state legislators to Israel. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1144.96s)]
*  There's a video press conference of Benjamin Netanyahu giving a big ceremonial check and [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  thanking the state legislators for passing these laws. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1153.56s)]
*  It's not in secret that Israel has campaigned to restrict American speech to pass laws like [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1156.76s)]
*  the anti-BDS and IHRA statutes that we've seen go into effect. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1164.76s)]
*  But of course, it's also the many billionaires and very wealthy interest groups and organized [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1171.36s)]
*  interest groups that are pressuring this administration. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1175.8s)]
*  It is incredibly hypocritical on one level for an administration that campaigned last [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1178.28s)]
*  year on a mantle of free speech and free expression and social media free speech to now flip and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1184.6399999999999s)]
*  engage in this kind of rampant, really draconian clampdown on free speech. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1190.96s)]
*  But this is also an administration that has worked hand in glove with many of these pro-Israel [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1196.4399999999998s)]
*  advocacy groups. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1200.8s)]
*  And these advocacy groups, whether based in Israel or based in the U.S., have been very [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1201.9199999999998s)]
*  clear about their interest in suppressing speech critical of Israel, suppressing reporting [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1207.36s)]
*  critical of Israel, taking anyone who criticizes Israeli government policy and deeming them [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1213.52s)]
*  an anti-Semite, a racist, a bigot, and having them disqualified from the public square. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1219.08s)]
*  I mean, David Friedman, the former Trump ambassador to Israel, really laid it out very [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1224.6399999999999s)]
*  clearly at a speech in Israel just last month. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1229.96s)]
*  He said, look, if you're an anti-Semite, you know, in his perspective, we're going to [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1232.88s)]
*  make your life miserable. We're going to deport you and we're going to put you in prison. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1239.2s)]
*  And that's what the Trump administration is doing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1242.52s)]
*  I mean, if you watch that clip, you listen to David Friedman's words, that does not [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1244.6000000000001s)]
*  sound like a government or a government official that is interested in the basic principles [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1249.48s)]
*  or foundation of the First Amendment or free speech. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1255.16s)]
*  This is someone who's looking to suppress and literally jail their political opponents. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrHqg9eg1g&t=1257.68s)]
