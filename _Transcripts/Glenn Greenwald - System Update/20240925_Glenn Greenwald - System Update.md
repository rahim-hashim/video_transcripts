# X And Telegram Forced To CENSOR & SPY?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE)
*  There are legitimate questions, valid legitimate questions, in the abstract at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=0.0s)]
*  least when it comes to the struggle, the power struggle between who ought to be [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=10.92s)]
*  able to govern the internet. Should it be extremely powerful private actors who [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=15.68s)]
*  are largely multi-billionaires who buy social media platforms and then can make [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=20.48s)]
*  their own decisions free of any laws or any state acts operating people's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=24.52s)]
*  countries without having to be subject to their laws and orders or [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=29.52s)]
*  should it be the government that gets to control the flow of free speech and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  information and ideas and activism and journalism on the internet and this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=38.36s)]
*  conflict that is now taking place is starting to find expression in very [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=43.68s)]
*  extreme ways because as we will never tire of emphasizing the overarching [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  paramount goal of the quote democratic world the number one priority has now [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  become to regain control of the flow of information to be able to censor speech [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=59.0s)]
*  on command and to do so on the internet the obvious innovation that is becoming [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=64.04s)]
*  the primary means through which humans communicate and learn about the war [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=69.56s)]
*  about the world that really is the primary goal the primary objective of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=73.16s)]
*  pretty much every country in the democratic world including the United [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=79.0s)]
*  States the EU the UK Canada Australia Brazil and so many others and we're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=82.42s)]
*  seeing this conflict play out in all sorts of ways now you may remember just [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=88.08s)]
*  to underscore the dynamic here that shortly before Donald Trump left office [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=92.4s)]
*  but while he was still the sitting elected president of the United States [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=97.8s)]
*  multiple social media companies including the pre Elon Musk Twitter [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=102.16s)]
*  Facebook Google and others all collaborated conspired to agree that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=106.68s)]
*  Donald Trump should be banned that his account should be banned on the major [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=112.44s)]
*  social media platforms that we use to communicate so the president of the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=117.68s)]
*  United States was forcibly silenced at least when it comes to the primary [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=120.4s)]
*  platforms online not through the acts of any judge or through the acts of any [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=125.28s)]
*  government but just simply through the decisions the arbitrary decisions of the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=129.28s)]
*  billionaire owners and controllers of those platforms at the time a lot of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=134.36s)]
*  governments around the world including ones that were no fans of Donald Trump [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=137.72s)]
*  vehemently objected and warned of how dangerous this was and their argument [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=141.72s)]
*  for why it was so dangerous is not because censorship is dangerous many of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=148.52s)]
*  the countries that objected such as Germany and France are very vibrant [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=151.8s)]
*  practitioners of censorship what their objection was was that if there's going [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=156.44s)]
*  to be censorship it should only come from the state it should be through laws [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=161.52s)]
*  implemented democratically by the elected representatives of the people of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=165.8s)]
*  the country and not through the arbitrary arbitrary decisions of various [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  billionaires now in the abstract it seems like a valid point of view to say [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  if you are a multi-billionaire and you buy a social media platform and you want [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  to operate in our country you either have to submit to all of our rules and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=184.0s)]
*  orders or we will ban you from our country pretty much every foreign [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  corporation is subject to those rules and that is the rationale that was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=194.04s)]
*  invoked by the United States and the Congress and the Biden administration to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=199.2s)]
*  to implement the new law that either bans TikTok from operating in the United [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  States or forces they sell to a different owner an owner that the US [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=208.48s)]
*  government will be able to control more directly and more easily their argument [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=213.92s)]
*  was this is a Chinese-owned company we don't want it on our territory we don't [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=217.56s)]
*  think they're complying with our rules or our laws we consider them a threat to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=221.76s)]
*  our national sovereignty and therefore we're going to ban it a lot of people in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=225.64s)]
*  the United States including ones who like to waive a free speech manner [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=228.32s)]
*  applauded that decision and they kept warning that whatever you think of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=231.4s)]
*  TikTok that precedent was very dangerous because it meant that states can now [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=234.4s)]
*  dictate to social media companies who must control them the rules by which [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=238.04s)]
*  they must operate and we're now seeing that play out both in Brazil where Elon [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=241.72s)]
*  Musk originally vowed to resist and to disobey the censorship orders that were [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=247.64s)]
*  flowing day after day from this one single judge only to now reverse course [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=253.36s)]
*  and to tell the Brazilian court that from now on he will obey those [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=258.6s)]
*  censorship orders in order to get regain access to Brazil which by all accounts [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=263.44s)]
*  X is close to doing and it also forced a long-standing online privacy activist [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=267.36s)]
*  Pavel Dura also a multi-billionaire who was the founder of the Russian equivalent [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=274.72s)]
*  of Facebook and was so committed to the principle that states shouldn't be able [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=278.6s)]
*  to control social media platforms and should be able to collect data on their [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=282.64s)]
*  users that he fled Russia and allowed the Russian government to seize his [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  company rather than submit to an unjust censorship regime imposed by the Russian [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=290.8s)]
*  government on him that's how committed for the long term he has been and he [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  created telegram with his brother in order to provide a heightened level of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=300.68s)]
*  privacy a heightened level of resistance against censorship and yet in the last [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  week telegram has also reversed course and now announced that they're going to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=309.2s)]
*  implement the very policies of censorship and state surveillance that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=313.08s)]
*  they for so long have built their identity on opposing and I think how [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=316.92s)]
*  this was done how Elon Musk and X was forced to back down in Brazil and then [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=321.12s)]
*  how telegram and Pavel Dura was forced to back down in the EU is extremely [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  worth understanding and covering because it all illustrates this very alarming [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=329.2s)]
*  and rapidly unfolding trend where states will go to whatever lengths they [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=335.0s)]
*  have to with no limits at all including the limits of law to ensure that free [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=339.36s)]
*  speech on the internet and because that is the one thing states fear most the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=344.28s)]
*  ruling class elite in the West more more than anything else fears a free and open [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=349.0s)]
*  internet and that is why they're doing everything possible to intimidate even [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=353.48s)]
*  multi billionaires to submit to their censorship regime and so far it's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=359.0s)]
*  working that we've covered at length what happened with X and summation this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=362.76s)]
*  judge has become a complete madman a complete authoritarian and with great [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=368.0s)]
*  regularity he simply orders people banned from the internet with the stroke [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=373.64s)]
*  of a pen there's no procedure there's no trial there's no due process even the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  people not even the people who are censored get advised of the order let [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=383.0s)]
*  alone have any mechanism for contesting it this judge just has absolute [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=388.2s)]
*  unlimited power of censorship to order anything or anyone removed from the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=392.24s)]
*  internet and all social media platforms are required to comply within two hours [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=396.84s)]
*  or face massive fines in Brazil and that was what Elon Musk said I refuse to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=400.88s)]
*  comply I'm not going to ban elected members of Congress and prominent [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=405.48s)]
*  journalists and influencers simply based on the say so of a judge with no [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=410.8s)]
*  explanation provided as to what they did wrong and he was very adamant that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=416.62s)]
*  that was going to be a cause that he would adhere to Elon Musk was and as a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=421.26s)]
*  result Brazil banned acts from existing in Brazil most Brazilians cannot access [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=425.62s)]
*  X and have not been able to for several weeks since that order was issued and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=432.7s)]
*  then even more alarmingly on top of it just to illustrate how far these [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=435.94s)]
*  governments are willing to go this judge invented a new law that anyone who uses [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=439.9s)]
*  a VPN which is a instrument to obscure where you're actually located and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=445.62s)]
*  typically they're used in order to circumvent the blocks on internet [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=451.5s)]
*  platforms imposed by authoritarian governments you can use a VPN if you're [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=456.58s)]
*  inside China or on or Russia North Korea Brazil in order to access information [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=459.54s)]
*  the state's trying to block you from seeing he said anyone who uses a VPN in [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=466.14s)]
*  order to access and use Twitter will be fined ten thousand dollars a day [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=469.62s)]
*  basically that's the equivalent of the fine in Reiche which is more the daily [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=474.3s)]
*  fine is more than the medium annual salary for Brazilian so it's not a joke [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=479.18s)]
*  of a fine it's a massive fine and Elon Musk called this judge repeatedly a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=483.98s)]
*  tyrant even threatened him and said his day is coming where he will be imprisoned [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=489.38s)]
*  and yet once X was blocked and they did things like take money millions of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=494.34s)]
*  not X's accounts but Starlink's account a completely separate company to pay for [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=502.14000000000004s)]
*  the fines this judge imposed on X and it started to appear that millions of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=506.82000000000005s)]
*  people in Brazil Brazil's a huge country it has a huge user base of use internet [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=512.7s)]
*  users started to migrate to competitors of X such as blue sky and threads and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=518.7s)]
*  every passing day that went by when X was banned from Brazil risked having [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=524.7s)]
*  those people go there permanently and never come back but also was putting a [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=528.66s)]
*  lot of financial harm both on X and on related companies like Starlink which is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=532.3399999999999s)]
*  part of SpaceX now as we pointed out before rumble was in the same situation [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=540.02s)]
*  rumble was receiving the same mountain of censorship orders that were unjust and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  yet rumble refused to comply they announced that we are not going to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  comply with the censorship regime we will not operate in Brazil given the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=552.2199999999999s)]
*  dangers of this judge this madman judge orders people imprisoned he threatened [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=556.58s)]
*  to imprison X officials as well as impose massive fines just so rumble to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=560.9000000000001s)]
*  this very day is not available in Brazil because rumble stood on principle and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=565.82s)]
*  gave up this very lucrative market for rumble that's what Elon Musk said he [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=570.98s)]
*  was going to do as it turns out for a lot of complicated reasons I'm sure [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=575.34s)]
*  there's massive pressure on Elon Musk from his investors his creditors [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=579.5s)]
*  shareholders and his other companies to back down and that's exactly what he's [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=583.74s)]
*  now doing he's now having X jump through all the hoops that the Brazilians are [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=587.62s)]
*  holding up for him in order to get back in Brazil here from the New York Times on [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=591.42s)]
*  September 21st Elon Musk is Elon Musk X backs down in Brazil quote in an abrupt [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=595.38s)]
*  reversal the social networks lawyers said it was complying with court orders [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=601.86s)]
*  that had previously defied Brazil Supreme Court could allow the site to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=606.14s)]
*  return next week this was a Friday article so already in Tuesday there's still no X in [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=611.16s)]

*  he was willing to do that he by a stroke of sheer luck many strokes of sheer luck [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1504.28s)]
*  he ended up not in the custody of United States but he's been exiled in Russia [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1509.52s)]
*  ever since and he gave up a lot of his liberty knowingly in defense of a free [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1513.0s)]
*  internet Julian Assange has done the same thing and they should be considered [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1518.28s)]
*  heroic for it but it's hard to say that everybody should be willing to sacrifice [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1522.48s)]
*  in the same way I mean it's very easy if you're not the one in a French prison [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1528.08s)]
*  cell to say oh Pablo Dura should refuse to cooperate and it's very easy if [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1533.16s)]
*  you're not Elon Musk and it's not your accounts out of which millions of [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1538.0s)]
*  dollars are being taken that your executives are being threatened with [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1543.0s)]

*  restrict your ability to travel that you may lose access to a major market and [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1551.96s)]

*  that have done that the main one being rumble so I think you can criticize Elon [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1562.76s)]
*  Musk I think you can criticize Pablo Dura if anybody is going to resist a [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1569.8s)]
*  censorship regime I guess it should be multi billionaires that's the whole [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1573.96s)]
*  reason to have and to chase billions of dollars it says that you can wield power [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1577.22s)]
*  in a way that you believe is a positive for the world and certainly preserving [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1582.12s)]
*  free speech on the internet is that but to me the much more important story is [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1586.92s)]
*  look at how far these governments are going now way beyond what the law allows [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1591.24s)]
*  France just invented a criminal theory it would be like putting AT&T executives [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1596.48s)]
*  in prison because someone uses their telephone service to plan an illegal act [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1600.48s)]
*  a drug sale or a robbery of a convenience store oh you allowed the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1604.76s)]
*  people on your platform to use your service to plan a crime and now you AT&T [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1611.1599999999999s)]
*  executives and shareholders are criminally liable for that crime that's [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1616.08s)]
*  an insane radical distortion of the law but these countries these governments [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1619.92s)]
*  don't care because they regard a free internet as an existential threat to [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1625.2s)]
*  their ability to remain in power and that's exactly what it is and that is [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1630.04s)]
*  why it forced to pick the most important battle of the current generation I would [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1633.1200000000001s)]
*  say preserving a free internet is if not the very top certainly one of the two or [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1639.8000000000002s)]
*  three most important causes because without that we will live in a system of [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1646.52s)]
*  closed homogenized information where the only information we can be exposed to [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1650.68s)]
*  the only information or ideas that we can express is information that these [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1658.08s)]
*  governments now using very extreme weapons to control the internet have [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1662.0s)]
*  approved of and once we fall into that trap where the entire internet has been [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1667.08s)]
*  controlled fully not partially as it is now but fully by governments around the [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1672.92s)]
*  world by ruling class power centers the one weapon that exists to dissent from [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaIVRnS3BE&t=1678.28s)]
