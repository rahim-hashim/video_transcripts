# Trump Speech Touts DOGE Cuts: Lee Fang Reacts
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA)
*  Hey, this is Li Fang. I'm your host of System Update, coming to you live from a very foggy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=0.0s)]
*  San Francisco. Glenn Greenwald is out this week. Last night, Trump gave his fifth State [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=11.82s)]
*  of the Union address. The president doubled down on tariffs, called for an end to the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=17.7s)]
*  war in Ukraine, and touted his many executive orders, especially on DEI. And yes, there [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=22.1s)]
*  were moments of theatrics between Trump and the Democrats and the audience. But Trump [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=27.72s)]
*  did something special that I think deserves greater scrutiny. Unlike recent administrations, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=32.72s)]
*  including his own, he dedicated a big part of his speech to his quest to root out wasteful [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=38.68s)]
*  spending. Let's watch a clip. And to that end, I have created the brand new Department [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=43.48s)]
*  of Government Efficiency, GOJ. Perhaps you've heard of it. Perhaps. Which is headed by Elon [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=49.28s)]
*  Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon. He's working very hard. He didn't [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=65.72s)]
*  need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  even this side, appreciates it, I believe. They just don't want to admit that. Just [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=94.52s)]
*  listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified. $22 billion from HHS to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=102.58s)]
*  provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens. $45 million for diversity, equity [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=112.06s)]
*  and inclusion scholarships in Burma. $40 million to improve the social and economic [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=119.6s)]
*  inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQI [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  plus in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of. $60 million for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=138.72s)]
*  indigenous peoples and Afro-Columbian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=147.12s)]
*  for making mice transgender. This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=156.56s)]
*  in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab Sesame [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=169.68s)]
*  Street in the Middle East. It's a program. $20 million for a program. $1.9 billion to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=179.24s)]
*  recently created decarbonization of homes committee. Headed up, and we know she's involved, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=188.36s)]
*  just at the last moment the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=197.22s)]
*  you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=203.02s)]
*  million for voter confidence in Liberia. $14 million for social cohesion in Mali. $59 million [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=214.66s)]
*  for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City. He's a real estate developer. He's done very well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=225.5s)]
*  $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia. $42 million for social and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=233.42s)]
*  behavior change in Uganda. $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia. $47 million [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia's doing very well with learning. You know what we're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=255.14s)]
*  doing. We should use it ourselves. $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=263.18s)]
*  The most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=271.82s)]
*  This is an important topic and one that really cuts across ideological and partisan lines, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  or at least it should. Corruption is a soul sucking force not only because it bloats government debt [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  and deficits. We all suffer from waste. For every fraudulent contract, for every misallocated dollar, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=290.02000000000004s)]
*  that's a loss of resources that could have been spent making America more educated, more secure, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=296.82000000000005s)]
*  more healthy, and more prepared for the future. It's also a problem that fuels alienation. We [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=302.18s)]
*  lose faith in our elected officials, in our entire system of governance, when we can't count on basic [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=308.34s)]
*  accountability for how our tax dollars are spent. Where I live in San Francisco, the government has [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=314.26s)]
*  one of the largest per capita local budgets in the world. Yet problems never seem to go away. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=320.9s)]
*  No matter how much money gets spent, housing gets more expensive. There are rampant overdose deaths, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=326.97999999999996s)]
*  a growing homeless population, despite the highest level of spending on homeless outreach [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=332.73999999999995s)]
*  programs in the nation, out of control property crime, empty storefronts, and programs that seem [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=337.46s)]
*  like a parody of municipal waste. $1.7 million spent building a single toilet in Noe Valley. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  $2 billion on a small expansion of the Muni subway, which was over budget, which blew through [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=350.97999999999996s)]
*  deadlines, and now is shutting down just after opening because of faulty construction. And the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=356.82s)]
*  more the city spends, the more questions are raised as NGO and private contractors keep getting [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=362.9s)]
*  busted with their hands in the cookie jar. We've had repeated FBI raids of city workers and city [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=369.38s)]
*  contractors, scandal after scandal about missing funds and kickback schemes. The problems seem [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=375.78s)]
*  endless. And given that so many democratic leaders, from Nancy Pelosi to Kamala Harris to Gavin Newsom, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=381.7s)]
*  got their political start in this city, it's no wonder that many Americans question whether these [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=388.9s)]
*  Californians are fit to lead. But as bad as the problems of San Francisco have become, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=393.85999999999996s)]
*  the city pales in comparison to the federal government. The government accountability office [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=400.5s)]
*  estimated that between 2018 and 2022, taxpayers lost somewhere between $233 billion and $521 billion [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=406.02s)]
*  due to fraud. Much of that money was lost during the pandemic when a gusher of nearly $2 trillion [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=414.42s)]
*  went out with little accountability. Both Democrats and Republicans are to blame for the lack of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=420.5s)]
*  oversight. But this is not a phenomenon that is limited to the emergency actions taken around [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  COVID-19, not even close. The most pernicious systemic fraud can be found throughout the system, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  especially in healthcare and defense spending. President Donald Trump, to his credit, has made [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=438.5s)]
*  a focal point of his administration. His new Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=443.85999999999996s)]
*  also known as DOGE, helmed in part by Elon Musk, has rapidly deployed in agency after agency, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  slashing private contracts and cutting the workforce. In particular, he has moved the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=455.85999999999996s)]
*  scale down the entire USAID budget. Like a lot of the Trump administration, it's a mix of good and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  bad, of bold action that no other administration would take alongside reckless actions that could [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=467.14s)]
*  do real harm. In many cases, they're missing the window of opportunity to go after real waste [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=473.46s)]
*  embedded in our system and have instead cut self-funding agencies like the CFPB. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  First, let's talk a little bit about the good around USAID cuts. I've reported for years on [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=486.58s)]
*  USAID money going to groups that work to overthrow foreign governments, undermine democratic [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=492.82s)]
*  elections, and indeed, censor even Americans over bogus claims of misinformation. Congressional [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=498.34s)]
*  Democrats have claimed that USAID simply, in the words of Senator Chris Murphy, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=505.14s)]
*  supports freedom fighters all over the globe. That reality, however, is much more murky. USAID [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=511.06s)]
*  has funded the Zinc Network, an anti-disinformation contractor that has targeted reporter [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=518.9s)]
*  Max Blumenthal, politician Vivek Gramaswamy, and Congressman Andy Biggs. USAID also funded a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=524.18s)]
*  pesticide industry public relations effort known as V-Fluence, which dug up dirt about [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=531.14s)]
*  American food journalists such as Michael Pollan and Mark Bittman. But most troubling, the Foreign [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=536.66s)]
*  Assistance Agency has financed a network of groups in Ukraine that have spread unsubstantiated claims [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=542.9799999999999s)]
*  that Americans in favor of peace are part of a dangerous misinformation network tied to the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=549.38s)]
*  Kremlin. In Ukraine, USAID, through its contractor Internews, supports a network of social media [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=554.98s)]
*  funded, social media focused news outlets, including the New Voice of Ukraine, Vox Ukraine, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=562.9s)]
*  Detector Media, and the Institute of Mass Information. These news outlets have produced [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=569.62s)]
*  a series of videos and reports targeting economist Jeffrey Sachs, commentator Tucker Carlson, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=574.58s)]
*  Professor John Mearsheimer, and even our own esteemed host Glenn Greenwald as figures within [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=580.74s)]
*  a quote, network of Russian propaganda who need to be censored from social media. In other words, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=586.0200000000001s)]
*  American taxpayers have been funding a defamatory smear campaign against other American citizens, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=592.34s)]
*  all in order to build out support for another forever war. But let's not forget USAID also [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=598.58s)]
*  helps administer global health programs that have been widely touted for saving millions of lives. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=604.98s)]
*  USAID helps administer PEPFAR, a program to distribute HIV AIDS medications. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=610.58s)]
*  The agency also funds the distribution of medicine and preventative care for malaria, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=616.74s)]
*  polio, tuberculosis, and a variety of programs for maternal and child health care in developing [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=622.1800000000001s)]
*  countries. There's a pause in these programs as the administration reviews them, but it seems [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=627.7s)]
*  clear that there's a real risk that they may be cut. These programs might not be perfect, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=633.1400000000001s)]
*  but they've generally impacted the world in profound and positive ways. Given how much other [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=638.74s)]
*  waste, fraud, and abuse exists in our system, these global health programs should be a low priority, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=644.0200000000001s)]
*  if not even a not a priority at all when it comes to cuts. Where should we be cutting? To prepare [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=649.7s)]
*  this segment, I just look back at my own reporting over the last decade. I've written for years about [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=656.26s)]
*  Pentagon waste that is far beyond the dollar figure for any silly sounding science grant [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=661.62s)]
*  or health program that was discussed last night at the State of the Union. In 2015, a military blimp [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=666.8199999999999s)]
*  broke free from its harness in suburban Maryland and dragged a cable through homes, causing [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=674.42s)]
*  destruction and property damage. Where did this thing come from? One week ago, we were chasing a [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=680.1s)]
*  blimp that broke free from the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Tonight, the Army still really hasn't let [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=685.38s)]
*  us know what could happen. We do know that the Pentagon suspended the Jaylins program for now. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=689.86s)]
*  The pair of blimps was being used to scan for incoming missiles and other flying threats. After [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=694.66s)]
*  the first one broke free, the Army grounded the second blimp. The military is waiting for the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=700.34s)]
*  results of its investigation before making a final call on the program. And Congressman Dutch [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=705.38s)]
*  Rupersberger issued a statement on the Pentagon decision. He says it's an unfortunate irony that a [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=710.5s)]
*  program designed to help safeguard the skies over the nation's capital threaten the security of our [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=716.18s)]
*  citizens on the ground, including in my district. He goes on to say the program is important for the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=720.98s)]
*  defense of our state and country, but says civilian safety must come first. He said the decision to [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=726.26s)]
*  continue the program should come after the Army's investigation into how the blimp got free in the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=732.1s)]
*  first place. The project was called Jaylins, or Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=737.94s)]
*  Netted Sensor System, produced by Raytheon at nearly three billion dollar cost to the Army. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=744.6600000000001s)]
*  The project was intended to defend against cruise missiles. Theoretically, it was supposed to track [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=751.22s)]
*  objects over an area the size of Texas, but these blimps kept getting destroyed in weather events [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=756.0200000000001s)]
*  and faced chronic technical issues. Frankly, they didn't seem to serve any useful purpose. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=762.1800000000001s)]
*  Finally, former Joint Chief of Staff James Cartwright rescued the program and had it deployed [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=767.94s)]

*  after securing the deal, joined Raytheon's board of directors, a job that paid him nearly [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=781.86s)]
*  nine hundred thousand dollars a year. Inevitably, Jaylins ended up in Maryland, where it eventually [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=786.5s)]
*  untethered and caused random destruction. This phenomenon is actually not unique. There are [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=792.98s)]
*  dozens of failed missile defense and radar systems that get refunded year after year by Congress [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=798.6600000000001s)]
*  under the influence of defense lobbyists and the allure for politicians and staff to one day become [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=804.98s)]
*  defense lobbyists. Let's take a look at a few quick examples. The government has spent 40 billion [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=810.34s)]
*  dollars on the ground-based midcourse defense system managed by Raytheon and Boeing. That [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=816.58s)]
*  program, which was carefully scripted with conditions in which the system operators knew [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=822.6600000000001s)]
*  the exact location, trajectory, speed, and dimensions of test missiles, even under those [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=827.3000000000001s)]
*  conditions, the GMD intercept systems failed to consistently produce any interceptions. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=833.0600000000001s)]
*  There's the Kinetic Energy Interceptor, a project from Northrop Grumman and Raytheon that also failed [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=838.5s)]
*  missile interception systems and was canceled after Navy officials found multiple problems, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=844.98s)]
*  including its limited range. That program cost 1.7 billion dollars. Or what about the Multi-Object [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=851.62s)]
*  Kill Vehicle developed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin at a cost of 700 million dollars? This [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=858.34s)]
*  program was canceled after military officials found that the anti-missile program faced [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=865.06s)]
*  insurmountable technical challenges. Or finally, the C-based X-band Radar, a floating radar designed [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=870.58s)]
*  to detect enemy missile launches, which failed after tests found that the radar had a limited [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=877.62s)]
*  field of vision and was highly vulnerable to corrosion at sea. The program, managed by Boeing [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=883.14s)]
*  and Raytheon, cost 2.2 billion dollars. I could go on and on just on the failed missile defense [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=888.74s)]
*  and radar systems, and I could spend another hour talking about faulty logistics systems, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=895.3s)]
*  corrosive and fraudulent work on submarines that leave them completely ineffective and [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=900.26s)]
*  inoperable, billions of dollars of waste on MRAPs and tanks, and the system and the list keeps going [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=905.3s)]
*  on and on. Where is the watchdog? Who's keeping this accountable? There are a few champions in [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=911.4599999999999s)]
*  Congress, people like Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders, who consistently call out military waste, but they [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=916.8199999999999s)]
*  are in the minority. The defense industrial lobby largely keeps Congress and any administration, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=922.66s)]
*  Democrat or Republican, completely subdued and subservient. We heard reports initially that Doge [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=928.26s)]
*  was crossing the Potomac and planning to tackle military fraud and waste, but so far we've only [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=935.38s)]
*  heard about canceled military DEI contracts. I have no problem cutting the DEI contracts, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=941.4599999999999s)]
*  but let's be honest, that is small potatoes compared to the big fraudulent and wasteful [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=948.18s)]
*  contracts from the defense industrial base. Thanks for watching this clip from System Update, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3giegph7oA&t=952.42s)]
