# Chris Hedges: The Security State WILL DESTROY Its Critics
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ)
*  I want to ask you, because anyone covering foreign policy and covering wars as you did [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  for so long obviously has to deal with in all sorts of ways the U.S. security state, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=12.44s)]
*  the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, and sort of how it influences a lot of these policies. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=17.48s)]
*  There's no way to understand one without the other. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=22.0s)]
*  After 9-11, we saw this series of whistleblowers from within the U.S. security state, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=24.88s)]
*  people like William Binney and Thomas Drake, and of course culminating with Edward Snowden, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=29.52s)]
*  who all had the same grievance, namely that the whole foundation of this secret part of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=34.68s)]
*  our government that would act without democratic accountability and outside of any transparency [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=41.2s)]
*  would be that the one taboo would ever be turning their power inward to manipulate the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=45.72s)]
*  American population and domestic population. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=50.92s)]
*  And a lot of them came forward primarily based on their grievance that that was the thing that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  they thought would never happen and they were seeing that more and more and more and more, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  that almost as much as these agencies were focused on foreign governments, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=61.52s)]
*  they were focused in our domestic politics as well. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=65.4s)]
*  I know there's been a lot of that since the creation of the U.S. security state, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=67.84s)]
*  but do you agree that that has gotten worse and more evident, the idea that the U.S. security [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=71.92s)]
*  state now plays a bigger role than ever before in our domestic politics? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=81.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's completely unaccountable and you can't control it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=85.08s)]
*  That's the problem and Arnold Tonby, when he writes about the decline of empire, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=90.0s)]
*  he talks about these rogue intelligence military complexes, institutions that essentially can [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=94.48s)]
*  no longer be regulated, can no longer be constrained. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=101.76s)]
*  All of the people who led us into the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Libya, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  there should be accountability. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  Not only is there not accountability, but the same people who are leading us into the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  disasters in Ukraine and funneling weapons to sustain the genocide in Gaza. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=116.76s)]
*  And that's very dangerous because at the beginning of an empire, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  empires are very judicious usually about the use of force. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=126.2s)]
*  What characterizes declining, dying empires is military adventurism, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=129.56s)]
*  where they seek to gain a diminishing or a lost hegemony through military fiasco. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think we can start with Vietnam and go basically right through of just one military [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  debacle after another. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  What we've done in the Middle East is probably the greatest strategic blunder in American history. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=146.8s)]
*  You're talking about Iraq. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm talking about Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=156.12s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=159.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  And Syria and Libya. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=160.12s)]
*  But that has had ramifications not only throughout the Muslim world, but through the global south. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=163.6s)]
*  The global south is reacting the way it is to what's happening in Gaza because they understand [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  that countries like Israel or countries like the United States are perfectly happy, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=175.52s)]
*  especially as we talk about mass migration and failed states from climate, the climate crisis, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=182.44s)]
*  and everything else to use genocide as a weapon. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=187.52s)]
*  So yeah, there was a moment, I'm sure you remember, when Feinstein did the torture report. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  Not my favorite senator, but nevertheless. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  And then she came out ashen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=203.44s)]
*  And the CIA had hacked the computers. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=204.88s)]
*  And she gave this very chilling press conference that basically said, you can't confront these [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=207.28s)]
*  people or they'll destroy you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's where we are. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=215.12s)]
*  And that is, these people perpetuate, they perpetuate war, they perpetuate surveillance. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=217.44000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I covered the Stasi state in East Germany at the end. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=225.68s)]
*  I covered the collapse. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  And it got into, you know, it got into this absurdist point where they, the Stasi were [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=230.44s)]
*  sending informants into retiree stamp clubs to see if somebody ever made a joke about [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  the dictator, Ara Konnick. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=240.68s)]
*  I mean, that's the point that you get. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=242.04s)]
*  But it calcifies the entire country. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=243.6s)]
*  It atrophies the entire country, not just the press, but any form of freedom of expression, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=245.92s)]
*  any capacity for democratic participation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=252.36s)]
*  We don't have democratic participation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=257.04s)]
*  Look at the DNC. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=258.72s)]
*  I mean, it was, you know, a choreographed burlesque show. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=259.72s)]
*  So it's a symptom of late empire. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=264.72s)]
*  And it's very, very dangerous. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=269.56s)]
*  And I think, of course, you have done a pretty good job of calling these people out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=271.44s)]
*  You know, it's funny, I remember, and this left a lasting impression on me. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=274.64s)]
*  When we first started doing the Snowden reporting, early on, there was a report about how the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  NSA was spying on even allied world leaders. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=282.64s)]
*  We did reporting on how they were spying on the then president, Brazilian president Dilma [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  Rousseff. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=290.12s)]
*  But the biggest splash was made when there was a report that actually didn't come from [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=291.12s)]
*  the Snowden reporting, but it came out at the same time that the NSA was spying on the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=296.2s)]
*  personal telephone devices of Angela Merkel, the then chancellor of Germany, supposedly [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=299.68s)]
*  a great ally of the United States. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=304.12s)]
*  And in a call she made to President Obama, she expressed indignation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=306.36s)]
*  The Germans leaked this and made clear that a lot of her indignation came from the fact [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=310.96s)]
*  that she grew up in East Germany under the Stasi and this kind of was a redolent of what [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=315.08s)]
*  she thought she had escaped. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=319.48s)]
*  And I remember very well that they had interviewed Stasi operatives and intelligence officials [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=321.36s)]
*  after that conversation happened and they said, we could never have dreamed of having [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=328.04s)]
*  the kind of ubiquitous surveillance that the NSA has developed as a result of the internet. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=333.4s)]
*  We were able to maybe intercept 20% of conversations if we're being aggressive at the peak. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=339.4s)]
*  And here you're talking about essentially gathering everything. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=344.88s)]
*  Let me shift gears a little bit because you referenced before the kind of group of people [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=348.88s)]
*  responsible for all those war and terror abuses, not just Afghanistan and Iraq, but [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=354.72s)]
*  Guantanamo, the whole system of detaining people with no due process, torturing them, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=358.16s)]
*  kidnapping off the streets of Europe and sending them to Syria and Egypt to be tortured, putting [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=363.36s)]
*  them in CIA black sites to purposely keep them away from human rights organizations, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=368.0s)]
*  the atrocities of which we're only now hearing about. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  And as you said, a lot of those people, most of them in fact, didn't suffer any consequences [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  from any of that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=379.04s)]
*  In fact, they're thriving most. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=380.04s)]
*  And we used to call them neocons. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=381.04s)]
*  You could almost call them Kamala surrogates at this point. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=382.8s)]
*  I mean, the vast majority of them are now actively on the side of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=385.68s)]
*  And sort of the final expression of that was when Dick Cheney, who just 20 years ago liberals [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=389.56s)]
*  routinely described as this Hitler figure, this grave threat to democracy, war criminal, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=396.88s)]
*  came out and said that he was endorsing Kamala Harris. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=402.32s)]
*  And when asked about why, Liz Cheney said, oh, it's not just because we hate Trump, it's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=404.92s)]
*  because we actually feel like the Democrats and Kamala's foreign policy align more closely [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=409.24s)]
*  with our foreign policy worldview than a Trump-led GOP. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  Personally, I think that she has a good point. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=420.92s)]
*  If I were a neocon who never changed my worldview, I think I would feel very comfortable as well [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=423.24s)]
*  in the modern day Democratic Party. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  What is your view about what this reflects, the fact that just 20 years later, after depicting [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  all these people as bloodthirsty monsters and war criminals and accusing them of having [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=436.2s)]
*  stolen the 2000 election, we now have no memory of that, no history prior to Trump. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's not only that Democrats are eager to accept their support, but that they feel [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=445.92s)]
*  so comfortable, more comfortable in the Democratic Party. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=450.68s)]
*  Well, let's be clear. The Democratic Party in Europe would be a far right party. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=454.96s)]
*  What's happened in the United States is that, and this was largely done by Clinton and Biden, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=459.36s)]
*  is they transformed the Democratic Party into the traditional Republican Party, and they [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=464.96s)]
*  pushed the Republican Party so far to the right it became insane. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=470.24s)]
*  What you've seen with the rise of a figure like Trump, and there's a cultish quality, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=474.96s)]
*  obviously, to the Republican Party around Trump, is that that ruling establishment party has become [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=480.24s)]
*  one party, and that's why they embrace figures like Dick Cheney. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=487.12s)]
*  Dick Cheney should be in prison, of course. If Dick Cheney endorses anyone, that's a good [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  reason not to vote for them. So what you've seen is the establishment turn on Trump. Why? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=496.24s)]
*  Well, it's not because he isn't going to give Goldman Sachs everything they want. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  We have this insane system, both under Biden and Trump, where the Pentagon submits a budget, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=508.72s)]
*  and then they give the Pentagon even more than they asked for. Nothing's going to, but he's [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=513.6s)]
*  impulsive. He's ignorant. He doesn't play the game. He's embarrassment, and so that's why. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=519.92s)]
*  Let me just interject there a little bit, because I remember the first time neocons really turned [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=532.4799999999999s)]
*  against Trump. It was in 2015. At the beginning of his campaign, he gave an interview where he [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=536.8s)]
*  said, I think the US is too pro-Israel. In order to make a deal, we need to have more credibility [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=541.28s)]
*  as an even-handed player. Two months later, he was at AIPAC giving the standard or even more [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=545.2800000000001s)]
*  radical pro-Israel speech, but that was his instinct. He does things like question the ongoing [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=550.0s)]
*  value or viability of NATO, argues that we shouldn't be engaged in regime change wars in Syria and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=555.76s)]
*  Libya and those kinds of things that we should try and get along with the countries that are [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=563.44s)]
*  authoritarian, which, and to me, it seems like whether he intends to do that or not, and there [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=567.6s)]
*  was a lot of stuff in that first administration that misaligned radically with what he said in the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=571.92s)]
*  2016 campaign, but I feel like leaving aside all of Trump's personal attributes and the things he [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=576.0s)]
*  says and does, there does seem to be more trust and faith in the reliability of people like Kamala [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  Harris and Joe Biden and the Democratic Party to protect these kind of establishment orthodoxies [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=591.04s)]
*  than they trust Donald Trump to do so. Do you think that's part of it as well? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=596.64s)]
*  Yeah. Absolutely. His ideology is skin deep. I mean, he ended up moving the, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=600.64s)]
*  recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=609.28s)]
*  But yeah, he's impulsive and he says things. I remember when he, his first debate, I think he [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=615.12s)]
*  was sitting with Jeb Bush, said that what everybody knew, but nobody in the political class would say [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=621.04s)]
*  was that Iraq was a big mistake. I can't remember the exact words he used or was disaster or [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  something like that, which it was. So there's an impulsiveness and they feel they can't control him. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=630.64s)]
*  So yes, I think that's exactly right. I think we've seen Trump, he kind of shifts with the winds, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=638.48s)]
*  but yes, I think that's exactly why the establishment is determined and as united. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=646.72s)]
*  The whole palace coup itself was, first of all, they wouldn't let anyone run against Biden in the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=653.36s)]
*  primaries. And then why did Biden step down? Because the billionaire class pulled the plug. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=658.32s)]
*  And then as soon as Kamala Harris, who nobody voted for, became the presumptive nominee, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=664.64s)]
*  you saw a situation where every week she was getting another $200 billion or something. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=671.6s)]
*  So that's just a small window into how decayed the system is. But yeah, I think you're right. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=678.08s)]
*  I think that's right. Yeah. And by the way, that same party, the Democratic Party, is the party [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=684.72s)]
*  which they will tell you is the only salvation for American democracies, the only way that if [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=688.48s)]
*  you believe in democratic values, you can preserve it. Thanks for watching this clip from System [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Hs-hriqqQ&t=693.2s)]
