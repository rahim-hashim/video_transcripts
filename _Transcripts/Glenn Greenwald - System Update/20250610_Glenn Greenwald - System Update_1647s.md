# Palantir EXPOSED: The New Deep State
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0)
*  So let's begin with the official starting point of when it became apparent that room [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=0.0s)]
*  was being made for new types of corporatized spying companies and militarized companies [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  to acquire new power and new roles. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=19.56s)]
*  One of them was an executive order issued by the White House and unveiled on March 20, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=22.7s)]
*  2025. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=27.0s)]
*  So two months after Donald Trump's inauguration, the headline of which was, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=28.0s)]
*  Stopping Waste, Fraud and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  In other words, the problem according to the new White House is information is not centralized [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=37.68s)]
*  enough. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=45.84s)]
*  You have some information over here, segregated over here, some segregated over here, some [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=46.84s)]
*  surveillance data here, some under this agency, and they describe that as wasteful and what [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  they want to do is to centralize it all under one authority. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=56.4s)]
*  I personally would prefer that to the extent the government collects data on American citizens, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=60.76s)]
*  it remain fragmented and siloed and therefore weakened. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=64.92s)]
*  But the point of this executive order was to describe that as wasteful and to restructure [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=69.32s)]
*  the government to ensure its centralization, meaning its consolidated control under a handful [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=73.68s)]
*  of specific actors who would be in charge of it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=80.0s)]
*  Quote, by the authority vested in me as president, by the constitutional laws of the United [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=83.52s)]
*  States of America, it is hereby ordered, quote, section one, purpose, removing unnecessary [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=87.8s)]
*  barriers to federal employees accessing government data. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=94.0s)]
*  Just let me emphasize that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=98.8s)]
*  And a part of this has to do with trying to empower what was known as DOGE, that the idea [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  was we had to ensure that the DOGE team wasn't impeded in their ability to collect information [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=106.58s)]
*  that instead they had access to everything. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=116.7s)]
*  And so here you see that the idea is to make certain to eliminate bureaucratic duplication [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=120.94s)]
*  and inefficiency by ensuring that there are no more barriers to federal employees accessing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=129.62s)]
*  government data. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=135.22s)]
*  I'm not sure if we can highlight that part or not. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=136.22s)]
*  We'll see in a second, but I wanted to really draw out that language because it seems so [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=140.02s)]
*  bureaucratically benign, but at the same time it's very candid about what it's attempting [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=144.62s)]
*  to do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  It then goes on, section three, eliminating information silos. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  Agency heads shall take all necessary steps to the maximum extent consistent with law [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=156.58s)]
*  to ensure that federal officials designated by the president or agency heads have full [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=162.18s)]
*  impromptu access to all unclassified information records data software systems and information [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=167.38s)]
*  technology systems. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=173.42s)]
*  It goes on, quote, agency heads shall take all necessary steps to the maximum extent [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  consistent with law to ensure the federal government has unfettered access to comprehensive [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=181.48s)]
*  data from all state programs that receive federal funding. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  Moreover, the secretary of labor and the secretary's designee shall receive to the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=192.02s)]
*  maximum extent consistent with law unfettered access to all unemployment data and related [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  payment methods, including all such data and records currently available to the Department [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  of Labor's Office of Inspector General. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=208.10000000000002s)]
*  Now, like most government programs, this could have a very benign intent, and it's described [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=210.38s)]
*  to appear benign. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  It's saying, look, there's some inefficiencies. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=218.1s)]
*  We need to analyze all the data. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=220.66s)]
*  Unfortunately, the data is all siloed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=222.62s)]
*  It's all in different places, and we want to make sure that we eliminate all of the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=224.7s)]
*  barriers to accessing all of it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=228.22s)]
*  We want to make sure that designated entities, whether public like DOES or private like private [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=230.26s)]
*  contractors, no longer experience impediments in collecting all of the information and centralizing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=237.78s)]
*  it all for whatever purposes they want to use that information. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=243.76s)]
*  Now, as I said, one of the primary impetus for this was to make sure that the team of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=248.04s)]
*  DOES that was designed to analyze waste and the like didn't have any further impediments [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  to their ability to get at some of the most sensitive data about American citizens. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=259.44s)]
*  Here's how CNN reported that in April of 2025. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=263.96s)]
*  Quote, DOES is building a master database for immigration enforcement, sources say. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  Falfers from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency are building a master database [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=272.44s)]
*  to speed up immigration enforcement and deportations by combining sensitive data from access across [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=276.16s)]
*  the federal government, multiple sources familiar with the plans. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=282.26s)]
*  Tell CNN Palantir, a Silicon Valley data analytics company co-founded by a Musk ally that has [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=285.6s)]
*  been used by immigration officials before for criminal investigations, is involved in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=293.04s)]
*  building out the database. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=297.6s)]
*  The company has long been ingesting and processing data from ICE and DHS sources. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=300.76s)]
*  The latest endeavor, however, is expected to go further by identifying people with civil [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=307.28s)]
*  immigration violations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=311.76s)]
*  Palantir is already a well-known government contractor, including at the IRS, so it would [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=314.52s)]
*  be, quote, a logical choice for the DOES teams to utilize it, a senior IRS official said. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=318.32s)]
*  Adding that, quote, it would be easy to change the scope of existing contracts and pay Palantir [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=324.44s)]
*  to do this stuff. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=329.44s)]
*  Quote, they're going to take the information we already have and put it into a system that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=330.44s)]
*  Trump administration official told CNN about DOES' plans. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=334.76s)]
*  It will be able to rapidly queue information everyone is converting to Palantir. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=338.12s)]
*  So that's the Trump administration's motto for what this reform is. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=343.98s)]
*  Everyone is converting to Palantir, meaning all of this data collection, all of this data [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=349.2s)]
*  mining, all of this access to information is all going to be done through Palantir, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=353.96s)]
*  through devices and systems created by Palantir, implemented by Palantir, overseen by Palantir. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=360.2s)]
*  Now, obviously, one reaction is to say, well, this seems like a good idea. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=369.2s)]
*  I want people to, the government to be able to more readily identify people who are in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=375.32s)]
*  the country illegally. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=380.24s)]
*  I want them to more readily identify fraud. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=382.16s)]
*  And so I have no problem with a system designed to centralize all this information to make [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=385.72s)]
*  it easier to achieve these noble ends. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=390.08s)]
*  The problem is that is always how expansion of the surveillance state and expansion of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=394.8s)]
*  the deep state is justified. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=400.88s)]
*  They always give you a reason why they're doing it for your own protection, why they're [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=402.62s)]
*  doing it for some good cause. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=406.8s)]
*  All of those programs ushered in in the wake of 9-11 and by the Bush and Cheney administration, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=409.92s)]
*  the Patriot Act, warrantless surveillance on American citizens, the vast elimination [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  of barriers designed to protect the privacy rights of Americans, all of that was justified [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=422.36s)]
*  in the name of finding terrorists more easily. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=428.16s)]
*  We didn't find terrorists on 9-11, even though we had all the reason and all the evidence [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=431.36s)]
*  and all the data in the world that should have let us find it, we failed to. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=435.2s)]
*  And so instead of holding people accountable, instead of making sure that we're looking [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=440.04s)]
*  more closely for terrorists, instead of all sorts of other things, we're going to claim [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=443.2s)]
*  that we didn't have enough powers. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=449.44s)]
*  We didn't have enough spying powers, we didn't have enough data mining powers, and we're [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=451.12s)]
*  going to tell the American people, look, we're going to collect information in a much more [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=455.36s)]
*  aggressive way, including about you, but don't worry, we're just doing it because we want [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=458.68s)]
*  to make sure to keep you safe from the terrorists. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  That was how the Patriot Act was justified. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=467.52s)]
*  Yes, we know this seems very extreme. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=469.32s)]
*  We know this seems like an extraordinary leap in the powers that the U.S. government is [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  supposed to have. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=476.35999999999996s)]
*  But don't worry, it's necessary because the only thing we're going to use this for is [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=478.73999999999995s)]
*  for good things. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=482.52s)]
*  We're going to use it to not to spy on dissidents, not to keep the American population under [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=483.52s)]
*  a microscope. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  We're going to use it just to make sure that we can catch terrorists and terrorism plots [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  more readily. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  And if you look at how the Patriot Act has been used, ever since it was implemented, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  ever since that justification was furnished that convinced a lot of people to support [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=503.32s)]
*  it, you will find that only in a small minority of cases has the Patriot Act been invoked [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  in connection with terrorism investigations. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  It has been used in a wide range of other sorts of efforts to investigate the American [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=515.88s)]
*  people, to keep track of them, to give to law enforcement. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=523.0s)]
*  I know for the first 10 years the percentage of cases of actual terrorism investigation [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=528.24s)]
*  that the Patriot Act was used for was extremely small. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=533.22s)]
*  I'm talking about 10 to 12, 15 percent. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=536.44s)]
*  So of course they're going to offer you good reasons why Palantir needs to collect and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  consolidate all this information under its control. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=544.64s)]
*  Oh, we're looking for illegal immigrants, we're looking for criminals, and the ability [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  to have all this information under one company and eliminate all the barriers that were [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  there to keep, preserve the privacy rights of Americans from having, from living in an [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=556.56s)]
*  omnipotent surveillance state. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=562.64s)]
*  Those are bothersome. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=565.4799999999999s)]
*  Those are impediments to the policy goals that we want to achieve. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=566.4799999999999s)]
*  And so don't worry, we're getting rid of all of those. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  We're going to have it all put under this one company called Palantir. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=572.16s)]
*  As I said, everything, everyone is converting to Palantir is the exact quote. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=576.48s)]
*  Now this didn't get much attention at the time. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  In the Trump administration there's constantly all sorts of things going on. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=587.56s)]
*  You have wars going on, you have attempts to avoid war like in Iran, you have all kinds [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=591.36s)]
*  of new domestic policies. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=596.92s)]
*  There was controversies about deporting students who criticize Israel. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=599.88s)]
*  All sorts of things just constantly going around. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=604.08s)]
*  And so when the Trump administration says everything is going through Palantir, not [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=605.92s)]
*  enough people really paid much attention to that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=609.88s)]
*  Now people are starting to wonder, wait a minute, what is exactly the role of Palantir? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=613.88s)]
*  Who is Palantir and what do they intend to do? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=618.0s)]
*  The New York Times ran a story just a couple weeks ago, May 30th, the title of which was [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=621.48s)]
*  Trump Taps Palantir to Compile Data on Americans. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=625.28s)]
*  Quote, the Trump administration has expanded Palantir's work across the federal government [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=630.48s)]
*  in recent months. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=634.8s)]
*  The company has received more than $113 million in federal government spending since Mr. Trump [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=636.4s)]
*  took office, according to public records, including additional funds from existing contracts [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security in the Pentagon. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=646.24s)]
*  This does not include a $795 million contract that the Department of Defense awarded the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=650.32s)]
*  company last week, which has not been spent. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=656.0400000000001s)]
*  The push has put a key Palantir product called Foundry into at least four federal agencies, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=659.8000000000001s)]
*  including DHS and the Health and Human Services Department. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=666.12s)]
*  Now obviously, when you think about your rights, your privacy rights, there are few privacy [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=669.96s)]
*  rights more sacred than things about your health or your family's health or the treatments [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=677.84s)]
*  you seek. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=682.7600000000001s)]
*  And obviously, Homeland Security has enormous databases that was created in 2002. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=683.7600000000001s)]
*  This department was once controversial, like most things that were once controversial. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  Everyone just accepts that we now have a Department of Homeland Security, even though we previously [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  never needed one, including the Cold War, during the Cold War. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=698.84s)]
*  And so just two of the agencies where Foundry and Palantir products are being now secretly [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=703.52s)]
*  placed contain among the most invasive and sweeping information about the American population. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=708.48s)]
*  And remember, this is all being done in the context of a political movement, of an administration [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=716.2s)]
*  that vowed to rein all this in, to ensure that the government wasn't spying on people [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=721.0s)]
*  anymore, that they didn't have the ability to abuse its powers of surveillance in order [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=728.32s)]
*  to harm political enemies, in order to harm other people. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=733.5200000000001s)]
*  The article goes on, quote, while adopting Foundry, which organizes and analyzes data, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=738.0s)]
*  while that paves the way for Mr. Trump to easily merge information from different agencies, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=745.84s)]
*  the government official said, Palantir's selection as a chief vendor for the project was driven [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=749.96s)]
*  by Elon Musk's Doge, according to the government officials. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=754.88s)]
*  At least three Doge members formally worked at Palantir, while two others had worked at [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=758.32s)]
*  companies funded by Peter Thiel, an investor and founder of Palantir. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=762.88s)]
*  Palantir has long worked with the federal government. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=767.6s)]
*  Its government contracts span the Department of Defense and the Center for Disease Control [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=769.52s)]
*  and Prevention. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  During the pandemic, the Bush administration signed a contract, I'm sorry, the Biden administration [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=775.0s)]
*  signed a contract with Palantir to manage the distribution of vaccines through the CDC. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=778.88s)]
*  At the IRS, Palantir engineers joined in April to use Foundry to organize data gathered on [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  American taxpayers, two government officials said. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=790.4s)]
*  So they're also at the CDC and the IRS, the IRS being the agency that most aggressively [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=793.76s)]
*  and invasively tracks all of your financial data, all of your earnings, all of your assets. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=799.36s)]
*  Their work began as a way to create a single searchable database for the IRS but has since [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=805.64s)]
*  expanded, they said. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=810.16s)]
*  A Treasury Department representative said that the IRS was uploading its systems to [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=812.12s)]
*  serve American taxpayers and that Palantir was contracted to complete the work with IRS [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=816.12s)]
*  engineers. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=821.3199999999999s)]
*  The goal of uniting data on Americans has been quietly discussed by Palantir engineers, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=822.56s)]
*  employees said, adding that they were worried about collecting so much sensitive data in [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=827.76s)]
*  one place. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=832.16s)]
*  The company's security practices are only as good as the people using them, they said. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=833.8399999999999s)]
*  They characterized some Doge employees as sloppy on security and as not following protocols [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  in how personnel devices were used, personal devices were used. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=844.52s)]
*  Now, this is one of the things that I recall during the Snowden controversy and the reporting [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=847.68s)]
*  and the debates that it spawned, this extreme irony that we were able to reveal how invasive, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  how sweeping, how limitless the information was that the NSA, unbeknownst to everybody, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=861.58s)]
*  was collecting on American citizens without the warrants required by the constitutional [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=868.14s)]
*  law. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=871.34s)]
*  I remember very well one day the NSA is kind of trying to scope around for different excuses, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=872.34s)]
*  said, oh don't worry, we're very, very vigilant in the security measures that we use, we keep [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=885.22s)]
*  your data very, very safe, you don't have to worry. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=893.38s)]
*  Of course, one of the reasons that was not a very satisfactory answer was the concern [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=896.5400000000001s)]
*  was that the NSA itself was going to abuse that information, it had done so, but also [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=901.26s)]
*  it was very hard to say that, oh don't worry, these security systems are so unbreakable, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=909.3s)]
*  so reliable when Edward Snowden had just right under their noses taken enormous amounts of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=915.74s)]
*  that data without having any slight idea on the part of the NSA that they had done so. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=922.02s)]
*  So much of this sounds familiar, oh don't worry, we are centralizing all data about [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=928.62s)]
*  you in an unprecedented way. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=932.42s)]
*  It's not just some of it's at the NSA, some of it's at the IRS, some of it's at CDC, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=934.9s)]
*  some of it's at Homeland Security, we're now centralizing all of those agencies in one [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=939.42s)]
*  private company, Palantir, and we're being asked to believe that Palantir's goals are [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=943.54s)]
*  benevolent, the people running Palantir are going to handle this information responsibly [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=951.9399999999999s)]
*  and without abuse, and that somehow this information will be kept safe so that others who have [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=957.86s)]
*  more malevolent intentions are incapable of using it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=964.3399999999999s)]
*  I think it's very important that Palantir was, to note that Palantir was founded in [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=969.78s)]
*  2002, because obviously that was at the height of the war on terror when people began to [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=973.9399999999999s)]
*  see not just the potential for government empowerment through a surveillance state, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=980.5799999999999s)]
*  but also privatized surveillance, which was and became a massive booming industry. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=985.54s)]
*  And if we could just go back a little bit to 2002, there was an event that happened [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=993.14s)]
*  at the time that I think a lot of people have forgotten about, it's involving John Poindexter, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=999.14s)]
*  so if we could go back to the prior document. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1003.4599999999999s)]
*  John Poindexter had been a government official in the Reagan and Bush administrations, Bush [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1007.4599999999999s)]
*  and he was very controversial because he was central to the Iran-Contra scandal. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1014.18s)]
*  He ended up as one of the more disgraced figures of that scandal, for those of you who don't [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1018.9s)]
*  know, in brief, Congress had passed a law saying that the U.S. government was barred from funding [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1023.38s)]
*  rebel groups in Central America because we were trying to overthrow governments there, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1030.98s)]
*  it was a very bloody war, so Congress passed a law prohibiting the use of funds for [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1037.3799999999999s)]
*  financing basically terrorist groups that we were funding in order to overthrow governments, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1042.02s)]
*  in order to maintain control of El Salvador, the Contras in Nicaragua, and the Reagan administration, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1047.1399999999999s)]
*  security apparatus decided they didn't care about that law, they wanted to ignore that law, they [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1054.18s)]
*  wanted to fund the Contras and other proxy groups in Central America anyway, but they couldn't get [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1057.7s)]
*  the money from Congress because Congress banned it and so they instead sold arms, very sophisticated [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1065.06s)]
*  arms, to Iran, very sophisticated missiles and arms secretly, they sold it to the Iranian regime, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1075.3s)]
*  took the money from that sale and then gave it to Nicaragua and El Salvador and the other [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1081.06s)]
*  groups Congress had barred them from funding and John Poindexter was at the center of this, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1086.26s)]
*  he kind of became disgraced and yet in 2002 the Bush administration decided to create [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1090.34s)]
*  one of the creepiest sounding agencies that you could possibly imagine, it was called the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1096.98s)]
*  Office of Information Awareness and there you see it on the screen, this is from 2002, the overview [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1102.5s)]
*  of the Information Awareness Office and here was Dr. John Poindexter who Donald Rumsfeld tapped to [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1108.98s)]
*  become the Director of the Information Awareness Office of DARPA and as they described it the idea [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1116.5s)]
*  was to have total information awareness, I think we have the text here, it's called as they described [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1122.9s)]
*  it, quote, total information awareness, a proto system, is our answer, we must be able to detect, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1130.58s)]
*  classify, identify and track terrorists so that we may understand their plans and act to prevent [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1136.58s)]
*  those from being executed. To protect our rights we must ensure that our systems track the terrorists [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1141.62s)]
*  and those that mean us harm and it talks about how these programs are focused on making total [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1146.82s)]
*  information awareness TIA real, it's a high level visionary functional view of the worldwide system [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1152.7399999999998s)]
*  somewhat oversimplified, one of the significant new data sources that needs to be mined [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1159.9399999999998s)]

*  under the auspices of Donald Rumsfeld, even that was a bridge too far, even for 2002 [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1191.94s)]
*  but it was very revealing of the limitless aspirations that the U.S. government had [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1199.7s)]
*  and knew that they could exploit 9-11 in order to create essentially telling the American people [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1207.38s)]

*  and out of that grew this office called total information awareness that although the office [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1217.6200000000001s)]
*  was named in just too much of an Orwellian and creepy way for the American population, the American [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1222.98s)]
*  media to accept became the ambition of the U.S. government, that is what ultimately led to the NSA [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1228.26s)]
*  programs that were designed to collect all information on American citizens without warrants [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1234.1000000000001s)]
*  to file it, to store it, to be able to analyze it, that became the mindset of not just the U.S. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1239.38s)]
*  government but of corporations seeking to become the providers of the technology that would enable [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1245.7s)]
*  it and the vastly lucrative contracts that would come from that and it was in that ethos, in that [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1251.22s)]
*  time period seeking to exploit that opportunity that Peter Thiel and Alex Karp created Palantir [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1259.7800000000002s)]
*  to become this newly agile, highly sophisticated version of a company that had unprecedented power [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1267.78s)]
*  to collect and store and data mine information about hundreds of millions of people, that is the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1275.06s)]
*  impetus that gave rise to Palantir and it continues to this very day to become their primary, to be [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1281.22s)]
*  their primary mission and that primary mission is now being fulfilled I think beyond anyone's wildest [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1286.5s)]
*  dreams given that the Trump administration is empowering them to be the company, the deep state [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1292.74s)]

*  about American citizens is run through and stored through and is managed by one company essentially [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1304.42s)]
*  overseeing the entire information collecting apparatus of the U.S. government and that is [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1313.62s)]
*  the [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1320.66s)]

*  just smoke and mirrors and here's the text, back in 2003 John Poindexter got a call from Richard Pearl, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1331.38s)]
*  for those of you who don't remember Richard Pearl was sort of like the darkest of dark neocons, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1339.0600000000002s)]
*  an old friend from their days serving together in the Reagan administration, Pearl, one of the [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1343.78s)]
*  architects of the Iraq war, which started that year wanted to introduce Poindexter to a couple [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1347.94s)]
*  of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who were starting a software company. This firm Palantir Technologies [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1353.22s)]
*  was helping to pull together data collected by a wide range of spy agencies, everything from human [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1359.94s)]
*  intelligence and cell phone calls to travel records and financial transactions, and even [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1365.94s)]
*  calls to travel records and financial transactions to help identify and stop terrorists planning [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1371.22s)]
*  attacks on the United States. Poindexter, a retired rear admiral who had been forced to resign as [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1376.98s)]
*  Reagan's national security advisor over his role in the Iran-Contra scandal, wasn't exactly [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1383.54s)]
*  the kind of starry-eyed idealist who usually appeals to Silicon Valley visionaries. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1388.34s)]
*  Returning to the Pentagon after the 9-11 attacks, he had begun researching ways to develop a data [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1393.7s)]
*  mining program that was as spooky as its name, Total Information Awareness. His work, dubbed a [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1398.9s)]
*  quote, super snoops dream by conservative colonist William Sapphire, was a precursor to the national [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1405.7s)]
*  security agency's sweeping surveillance program that were exposed a decade later by Edward Snowden, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1412.8200000000002s)]
*  yet Poindexter was precisely the person Peter Thielen, Alex Karp, the co-founder's Palantir, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1418.3400000000001s)]
*  wanted to meet. Their new company was similar in ambition to what Poindexter had tried to [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1424.34s)]
*  create at the Pentagon, and they wanted to pick the brain of the man now widely viewed as the [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1430.1799999999998s)]
*  godfather of modern surveillance. Poindexter told me he had suggested to Karp and Thielen that they [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1435.22s)]
*  partnered with one of the companies that worked on Total Information Awareness, but the two men [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1441.86s)]
*  weren't interested. Quote, they were a bunch of young, arrogant guys, Poindexter said, and they [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1446.82s)]
*  were all convinced that they could do it all. And I guess on some level that arrogance ended up [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1450.74s)]
*  being vindicated because now just a couple of decades later they are in exactly the position [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1458.34s)]
*  that 10 years ago we revealed that the NSA was in that created so much controversy. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1464.42s)]
*  And the fact that there was such a strong reaction across the political spectrum, such a strong [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1471.54s)]
*  revulsion to the idea that the NSA had the ability and exercised that ability to collect data on all [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1477.54s)]
*  Americans, something this part of our government was never supposed to do, collect dossiers on [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1483.3s)]
*  American citizens en masse, is now being done by a kind of sketchy and shady privatized corporation [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1487.78s)]
*  that was created right after 9-11 to exploit the surveillance state opportunities, and that this [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1496.82s)]
*  information is being concentrated in this one company across all government agencies in a way [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1502.34s)]
*  that not even the NSA back when we were revealing the Snowden reporting could have imagined. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1507.3799999999999s)]
*  It's something that I think quite obviously [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1513.3s)]
*  merits far more attention about what Palantir is, what it believes, and what it's doing. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1517.3799999999999s)]
*  All right, you have heard all the hype. Maybe you've seen the new launches sell out, but if [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1526.5s)]
*  you still haven't tried 1775 coffee yet, this is your shop because they've just launched their [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1530.26s)]
*  1775 starter kit, and the first drop is limited to just a thousand units. The starter kit isn't [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1536.02s)]
*  some basic sampler pack. I know there's a lot of sampler packs, basic sampler packs all over the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1542.74s)]
*  internet. This is not one of those. It's a full-on pack of caffeine freedom. It's a bold dark roast [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1547.3799999999999s)]
*  that hits hard and strong. It's a smooth medium roast for strength without bitterness, very soothing, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1553.62s)]
*  and vitality mushroom coffee for clean energy, laser focus, and zero crash. It's all single origin, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1560.1s)]

*  has no place in real coffee or real values. We're talking about a gold spoon clip. You get a frother [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1573.4599999999998s)]
*  that is built to last. A lot of frothers are designed to wear out or break very quickly. This, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0&t=1580.1799999999998s)]
