# Important Court Victory for Non-Violent Jan 6 Protesters
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog)
*  It's almost certain that January 6th is going to take center stage in the 2024 election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=0.0s)]
*  After all, there's very little in Joe Biden's record that people actually like and that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=12.3s)]
*  he can point to. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=16.06s)]
*  And so he and the Democrats are going to run as much as possible on accusations that however [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=17.06s)]
*  much you hate Joe Biden, Donald Trump is worse. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=21.5s)]
*  And one of the leading claims that they will make in order to do that is that Trump is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  some sort of a fascist or a dictatorial threat to all things decent in American democracy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=28.58s)]
*  And to accomplish that, they will constantly try and remind the country about January 6th, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  claim that it's an insurrection, that we were just seconds away from having the world's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=37.94s)]
*  most militarized and powerful government overthrown by a thousand or so gen acts and boomers who [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=42.54s)]
*  came from Facebook, got off their couch for the first time in months. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  Some of them did not wield any weapons and yet somehow we were told on January 6th came [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=55.76s)]
*  just seconds away from overthrowing the American government. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=60.48s)]
*  No, it wasn't a protest. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  It wasn't even a riot. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=64.84s)]
*  It was an insurrection, a coup. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=66.02s)]
*  And one of the things that has been done with that narrative is to construct a edifice of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  extremely threatening and repressive legal precedent that is designed at its core to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=75.28s)]
*  find ways to do something that really could never be done in this country previously, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=82.12s)]
*  which was how to take people engaging in nonviolent political protest. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  And remember, no matter what you think of January 6th or what it was or how it was caused, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=92.2s)]
*  no matter what you think of that, the fact is, the irrefutable fact, it's just true numerically, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  is that the vast, vast majority of people who were accused of crimes in connection with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  January 6th, the more than 1,000 Americans who were charged with crimes, roughly 85 or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=108.0s)]
*  90% of them are acknowledged to have been nonviolent. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=115.0s)]
*  They are not accused of having used violence, which means they participated in a protest [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=119.28s)]
*  without using violence of any kind. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=124.12s)]
*  And the Biden Justice Department made very clear as to the FBI that they consider January [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  6th to be one of the worst, most dangerous, darkest days in our history, that they would [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=132.2s)]
*  launch an unprecedented investigation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=135.6s)]
*  And to do that, it was necessary to try and put the people who they prosecuted in jail, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=138.6s)]
*  not as being people guilty of a misdemeanor, but as people guilty of felony so they could [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  put them in prison for a long time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=150.4s)]
*  And that is exactly what happened. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=151.72s)]
*  There are a lot of January 6th defendants who have been convicted of felonies, even [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=153.12s)]
*  though they're not accused of participating in insurrection and they're not accused of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=160.0s)]
*  using violence, they're accused of a nonviolent protest. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=165.76s)]
*  So how is it that prosecutors were able to take nonviolent political protesters and convert [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=168.44s)]
*  them into felons? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=174.64s)]
*  Obviously that wasn't done to virtually anybody in the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=175.64s)]
*  went on for months. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  People who engage in violence were sometimes prosecuted, often they weren't, but nonviolent [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=184.72s)]
*  protesters were almost never prosecuted. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  They were arrested on misdemeanor charges at most. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=190.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris did things like raise money for their bail fund and they weren't treated [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=193.48s)]
*  as serious criminals at all because they weren't engaged in violence. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=197.48s)]
*  And typically nonviolent political protesters in the US are rarely charged and if they are, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=200.96s)]
*  they're charged with misdemeanors, but not in the January 6th case. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=205.36s)]
*  And the way that this was done is so ironic. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=210.2s)]
*  We've been over this before. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=212.52s)]
*  I've written articles about it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=213.52s)]
*  If you can go and if you want to really dig into the legalities of what I'm describing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=214.76s)]
*  here, you can do so. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=221.2s)]
*  But basically there were laws that were enacted in the wake of the collapse of Enron, which [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=222.2s)]
*  was a gigantic energy company. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  Paul Krugman and a bunch of luminaries sat on its board. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=230.72s)]
*  It turned out to be a gigantic scam. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=234.16s)]
*  It collapsed in 2000. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  It cost billions and billions of dollars for investors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=238.88s)]
*  It was basically just a Ponzi scheme. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=243.28s)]
*  And prosecutors, federal prosecutors argued that they didn't have sufficient weapons in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=247.0s)]
*  their hands to punish the parties they wanted to prosecute, including accounting companies. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=251.28s)]
*  There was a major accounting company that was prosecuted and disbanded as part of that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=257.88s)]
*  prosecution. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=263.4s)]
*  And so they enacted a new law, one sponsored by Paul Sarbanes, the Democratic Senator from [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=265.36s)]
*  Maryland. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=271.04s)]
*  It was called Sarbanes-Oxley and it was designed basically to turn into felonies for the first [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=272.04s)]
*  people who obstructed investigations or the gathering of evidence or some kind of a formal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=276.84s)]
*  government inquiry so that you could actually be guilty of felonies if you obstructed their [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=283.64s)]
*  investigation, if you withheld information from them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  That's what it was designed to do. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  And prosecutors decided that they would take this Sarbanes-Oxley law and try somehow to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  argue that people who protested on January 6 and who delayed the counting and certification [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=302.56s)]
*  of the electoral college vote by three hours were somehow guilty of what that statute was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  attempting to criminalize. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=317.5s)]
*  And the irony of this is that in order to argue this, the prosecutors had to say what [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=320.72s)]
*  Donald Trump was saying, which is that the certification of the electoral college by [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=327.12s)]
*  the Congress on January 6 is not merely a ministerial or ceremonial act, that it's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=331.12s)]
*  actually a real government investigation to dig into the validity of the certified results [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=335.56s)]
*  of the state's election results in the electoral college, that it's actually a real investigative [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=343.16s)]
*  proceeding of the kind Sarbanes-Oxley was designed to criminalize if you disrupted it, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  even for three hours. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=353.48s)]
*  And it was a preposterous theory because the entire point of those who want to turn [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=356.4s)]
*  January 6 into an insurrection was that there is nothing to decide on January 6. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=361.12s)]
*  It's just a ceremonial ritual and that the Congress has no discretion. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=365.44s)]
*  And it was, of course, Trump's argument to Mike Pence, no, Congress does have discretion, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=370.96s)]
*  which is why as Vice President you have the power to reject the certified rulings if [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=374.23999999999995s)]
*  you believe there was fraud there. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  So they actually had to adopt Trump's view of January 6, that this is no symbolic act [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=380.52s)]
*  or ritual or ceremony that was just empty, but it was actually a discretionary government [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=385.32000000000005s)]
*  investigation into the electoral college. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=390.48s)]
*  And that and that alone is how they accused January 6 defendants who didn't use violence [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=392.36s)]
*  of being felons by saying they disrupted for three whole hours a government investigation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=397.92s)]
*  of the kind Sarbanes-Oxley was designed to turn into felonies. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=404.92s)]
*  Now, because the government poured enormous amounts of resources into prosecuting these [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=408.28s)]
*  people and most of them were impoverished or not able to afford lawyers because a lot [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  of them were being threatened with many, many years in prison if they didn't plead guilty, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=422.32s)]
*  most of these issues did not end up being litigated effectively. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=427.11999999999995s)]
*  But this question did go to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the D.C. Circuit Court [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=431.32s)]
*  of Appeals a couple of years ago ruled that this interpretation was valid, that January [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=435.12s)]
*  6 was enough of a discretionary government investigation that if you disrupted even for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=442.12s)]
*  a short period of time, you can be guilty of a felony under this law. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=448.8s)]
*  And as a result, that question is decided unless and until it goes out of the full D.C. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=453.32s)]
*  Circuit Court or to the Supreme Court, meaning any judges underneath this court in the district [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  court level or even on the appellate court are bound by that ruling. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=464.08s)]
*  So there was a ruling today in a case of one of the January 6 defendants who was given [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  a lengthy prison term even though he wasn't accused of violence. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=474.4s)]
*  And the argument that he brought to the appellate court was basically one that said that January [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=482.96s)]
*  6 was not the kind of ceremony or ritual that that law covered. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  Now the court said, look, we can't rule on this question for purposes of reversing your [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=494.44s)]
*  conviction, your felony conviction, because this court has already decided it and we're [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=498.96s)]
*  bound by that ruling until the Supreme Court rules. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=502.32s)]
*  But what they did do was they addressed this question for purposes of the sentence, meaning [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=505.0s)]
*  under the sentencing guidelines, if somebody obstructs an investigation of this kind, they [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=511.34s)]
*  can get a much larger prison sentence. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=515.68s)]
*  And the lower court judge gave him a lengthy prison sentence based on the interpretation [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=518.68s)]
*  of this law that said January 6 is kind of an act. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=522.14s)]
*  And the appeals court today, composed of three Democratic appointed judges, two by President [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  Obama and one by President Clinton, overturned the imposition of this harsh prison term for [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=529.8s)]
*  this one January 6 defendant based on this theory that could be used to invalidate these [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=535.7199999999999s)]
*  felonies for everybody. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=539.64s)]
*  And in the process, issued a ruling that could affect, likely will affect the prison terms [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=542.44s)]
*  of over 100 January 6 defendants who were also sentenced to enhanced prison sentences [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=548.76s)]
*  based on this theory that the appeals court today unraveled. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=554.08s)]
*  Now I know it's a little bit complicated, a little bit legalistic, that explanation, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=558.28s)]
*  but it's necessary to understand the ruling and understand what is at issue. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=561.72s)]
*  Like I said, if you want to dig more deeply into the ruling itself and the legalities [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=566.6s)]
*  of it, you can find my articles on it if you enter Glenn Greenwald in. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=573.16s)]
*  And prosecution of January 6 defendants, we'll try and get that up on the screen as well. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=578.96s)]
*  We'll put it in the chat as well, the link to that article that I wrote explaining the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=584.12s)]
*  legalities in greater detail. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=590.22s)]
*  But here's what the court ruling said today, and you can hear by the tone of the Washington [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=591.78s)]
*  Post how clear of a victory, how major of a victory it is, not only for January 6 defendants, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=596.2s)]
*  but also for the right to protest in general. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  Victories have been very few and far between for January 6 defendants. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  Prosecutors have just run roughshod over all of their rights. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=609.1600000000001s)]
*  Here you see the Washington Post story on this from today, appeals court ruling that [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  vacates Capitol Ryder's sentence could impact dozens of January 6 cases. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=619.36s)]
*  While a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld Larry Brock's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=625.6s)]
*  conviction, the court said a judge wrongly applied an enhancement that lengthened the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=629.4s)]
*  recommended prison sentence range under federal guidelines. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=635.1s)]
*  The enhancement, on the ground that Brock's conduct resulted in, quote, substantial interference [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=638.2s)]
*  with the administration of justice, has been implied in more than 100 other January 6 defendants [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=643.6s)]
*  cases, said Patricia Hartman, a spokesperson for the Washington U.S. Attorney's Office. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=651.44s)]
*  If the ruling stands, those defendants who have not already completed their prison term [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=655.52s)]
*  may push for new sentences. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  The obstruction felony charge is already at the center of another case the U.S. Supreme [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=661.68s)]
*  Court will hear arguments on next month that could upend hundreds of Capitol Ryder cases. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=666.04s)]
*  The justices agreed to hear the appeal fired by lawyers for another Ryder charged with [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=672.04s)]
*  obstruction of an official proceeding, one of the most widely used charges brought in [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=675.96s)]
*  the January 6 attack. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  Brock's attorney had said in court papers that the misapplied enhancement likely increases [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=682.36s)]
*  client's sentence by about nine months. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=686.24s)]
*  Prosecutors had recommended the sentence of five years in prison. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=689.84s)]
*  Now that's how significant that is. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=693.72s)]
*  Now I think we're ready to pull up the article that I wrote about all of this on the screen [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=695.44s)]
*  when I was at Substack. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  If you want to read that, there you see it on the screen. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=702.0s)]
*  It's from January 20th of 2022 and the headline is Congress's January 6th Committee Claims [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=704.6s)]
*  Absolute Power as it Investigates Citizens with No Judicial Limits. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=713.12s)]
*  It talks about what the Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney-led 9-11 Commission was doing in abusing [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  its power, but in there as well it talked about how prosecutors had to stretch in order [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  to find ways to turn nonviolent protesters into felons using an exotic and radical ruling [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=728.92s)]
*  of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that the Supreme Court will soon rule on and that the court [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=735.0799999999999s)]
*  today in Washington said for sentencing purposes was not valid. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=740.36s)]
*  Now here's the case itself. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=744.64s)]
*  It is called the United States of America versus Larry Rendell Brock. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=747.52s)]
*  He's the defendant and it was argued on September of 2023, decided March of 2024. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=750.68s)]
*  Now you see here, just by the way, is a commentary on how courts work. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=756.72s)]
*  This issue was briefed, the lawyers wrote all their briefs, in the summer of 2023. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=762.2s)]
*  The court heard oral argument on it September of 2023. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=770.28s)]
*  It was only today, March 1st, 2024, that the court issue a ruling. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=776.0400000000001s)]
*  So you have six months, or yeah, six months, five months basically, five full months between [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=782.16s)]
*  the time it was argued in the appellate court and the time that it was the court decided [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=790.4399999999999s)]
*  while these people are just sitting in prison week after week, month after month while the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  court just takes its sweet time to issue a ruling. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=799.92s)]
*  And this is very common. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=803.0s)]
*  It was one of the things when I was a lawyer that I was most frustrated by. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=804.0s)]
*  There's a Martin Luther King phrase that justice delayed is justice denied and nothing happens [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=808.8s)]
*  to the federal courts or in the state court system in the United States quickly, even [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=814.4399999999999s)]
*  when it's a matter of urgency that just sits there and these judges just take their sweet [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=818.3599999999999s)]
*  time to rule on it and your clients might be in prison, they might be in bankruptcy, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=822.7199999999999s)]
*  they might have their money wrongfully withheld and there's just no control that you or anyone [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=827.7199999999999s)]
*  else has on how quickly or slowly these judges rule. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=832.16s)]
*  So the ruling itself is quite a victory and again, not just for the January 6th defendants [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=837.52s)]
*  who are nonviolent but also for the right of protest itself. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=841.48s)]
*  Here's what part of the relevant part of the ruling said, quote, the court convicted Brock, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=845.36s)]
*  meaning the lower court, convicted him of six crimes including corruptly obstructing [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=850.88s)]
*  Congress's certification of the electoral court under 18 USC 1512. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=854.76s)]
*  At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock's [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=861.12s)]
*  Section 1512 conviction. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=865.64s)]
*  That's the one for Sarbanes-Oxley on the ground that Brock's conduct resulted in quote, substantial [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=868.4399999999999s)]
*  interference with the administration of justice. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=873.9599999999999s)]
*  We hold today that the administration of justice enhancement does not apply to interference [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=877.7399999999999s)]
*  with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=884.04s)]
*  For that reason, we vacate his sentence for his Section 1512 conviction and remand to the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  district court for resentencing. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=891.88s)]
*  The government responds that quote, administration of justice refers to the proper administration [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=895.68s)]
*  of law by all three branches of government. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=899.74s)]
*  Quote, obstruction of the electoral college certification vote on January 6th falls comfortably [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=902.56s)]
*  within the meaning of administration of justice as used in that law because it involves Congress's [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=907.08s)]
*  performance of duties required by law. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=911.96s)]
*  That's the argument of the government. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=913.96s)]
*  Several of our district courts have agreed with the government's view. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=916.6s)]
*  So with great respect to our district court colleagues' thoughtfully reasoned efforts [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=919.56s)]
*  to apply this guideline, we hold that for purposes of the sentencing guideline 2J1.2, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=922.88s)]
*  the phrase quote, administration of justice does not encompass Congress's role. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=929.92s)]
*  Considered in context, Congress's counting and certification of electoral college votes [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  is but the last step in a lengthy electoral certification process involving state legislators [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=939.0799999999999s)]
*  and officials as well as Congress. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=943.3399999999999s)]
*  Taken as a whole, the multi-step process of certifying electoral college votes is important [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=945.76s)]
*  to our democratic system of government as it is, bears little resemblance to the traditional [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=949.44s)]
*  understanding of the administration of justice such as the judicial or quasi-judicial investigation [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=954.96s)]
*  of determination of individual rights. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=960.5200000000001s)]
*  Now that is the key. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=962.2s)]
*  This law said that if you disturb or interfere with corruptly the administration of justice, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=964.4000000000001s)]
*  meaning just department investigations or judicial hearings of the kind that they had [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=969.2800000000001s)]
*  so much difficulty prosecuting an Enron because people were interfering it and they didn't [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=973.6400000000001s)]
*  have these legal weapons in their hands to threaten them with felonies, that's what this [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=978.4000000000001s)]
*  law was designed to fix. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=981.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not meant for a congressional hearing or a congressional certification of electoral [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=985.2s)]
*  college which has none of the attributes of a real judicial investigation or investigation [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=989.84s)]
*  by the justice department. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=994.44s)]
*  That was always the corruption at the heart of the January 6th defendant's prosecution [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=995.44s)]
*  is to try and turn nonviolent protests into a felony. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1000.24s)]
*  The problem is as you can see it takes a kind of difficult, heavy, somewhat boring [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1003.88s)]
*  recitation of legal doctrine and so it was difficult to get people really excited about [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1011.24s)]
*  what was being done here. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1016.64s)]
*  Finally, an appellate court had the courage to step in and say the interpretation of the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1018.88s)]
*  law that courts have been using and that prosecutors have been using to give these people enormous [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1025.4s)]
*  prison sentences is not appropriate, is not intended this law to encompass this kind of [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1033.04s)]
*  behavior and as a result they sent it back to the district court and said you cannot [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  enhance prison sentences based on this interpretation that the court rejected. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1045.56s)]
*  As I said, even though technically they couldn't undo the conviction itself because this court [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1050.0s)]
*  had already, not these judges but other judges on this court had already decided in favor [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1057.6s)]
*  the prosecutors and now it's out at the Supreme Court level, this decision goes to the heart [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1061.64s)]
*  not just of the sentencing part of this but also the conviction part of it, the part that [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1067.44s)]
*  turned these people into felons. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1071.0800000000002s)]
*  Now as a practical matter a lot of these people are in prison already, they've served out [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1074.92s)]
*  their term by the time it gets up to the Supreme Court. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  The Supreme Court is going to hear oral argument and the Supreme Court will decide. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1080.4s)]
*  Even if the Supreme Court rules in their favor it won't matter to a lot of them but it will [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1083.96s)]
*  matter to some who are still lingering in prison with very lengthy prison terms even [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1087.32s)]
*  though they were not guilty of any kind of violence. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1092.4399999999998s)]
*  Now here is a second article that I wrote on this and I think this one is actually even [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  more directly applicable to this question. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1104.4599999999998s)]
*  It was in November of 2021 and the headline of this was Democrats are profoundly committed [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1106.3999999999999s)]
*  to criminal justice reform for everyone but their enemies and it was basically an argument [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1112.44s)]
*  that under the Trump era prosecutors in the Justice Department went after Trump associates [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1119.0800000000002s)]
*  and January 6th defendants using very pro-prosecutorial theories of criminal justice that the liberal [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1124.8400000000001s)]

*  I think that liberals believe that people are in prison too easily in the United States [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1139.88s)]
*  that we need more permissive interpretation of laws, more permissive interpretations of [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1143.3200000000002s)]
*  a prosecutor's power and I'm always somebody who has believed that as well. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1150.16s)]
*  The United States in prisons more of its citizens than any other country by far in the world [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1154.1200000000001s)]
*  both as a percentage and as an absolute number and I've always believed that prosecutors [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1158.44s)]
*  have too much power that it's too easy to obtain convictions especially on these kinds [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1164.18s)]
*  and that has always been a more left liberal view. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1169.64s)]
*  It's also a libertarian view. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1171.52s)]
*  There are a lot of libertarians who advocate for reform of prosecutorial power and criminal [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1173.08s)]
*  justice reform and yet what happened here was that because the people being punished [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1178.24s)]
*  with these pro-prosecutorial theories were Trump associates like Michael Flynn or January [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1184.44s)]
*  6th defendants almost no people on the liberal left objected to any of this because they [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1191.0s)]
*  were so happy to see their enemies punished and there you see the subheadline in this [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1197.0800000000002s)]
*  article principles of rehabilitative justice reform of the carceral state and liberalized [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1202.0s)]
*  criminal justice evaporate when Democrats demand harsh prison for their political adversaries [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1207.0s)]
*  and this is so much of what I think has been the problem in the Trump era maybe even in [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1212.64s)]
*  politics generally is that people proclaim belief in a certain principle they proclaim [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2e5av7amog&t=1217.5600000000002s)]
