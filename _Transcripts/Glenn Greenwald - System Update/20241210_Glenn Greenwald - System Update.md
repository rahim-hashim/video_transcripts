# Aaron Mat√©: The U.S. Was Obsessed With Overthrowing Assad
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84)
*  Let me ask you about just a couple more questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. objective here, because obviously the U.S. objective is not to rid the region [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=9.8s)]
*  of tyrants and autocrats and brutal dictators because some of our best friends in that region [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=16.16s)]
*  that we have installed and prop up are characterized by all the things that you just said, a lack [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=20.8s)]
*  of dissent, being tortured. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=26.84s)]
*  If you criticize the government, that's certainly true in Egypt. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=28.24s)]
*  It's true in the United Arab Emirates. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=30.68s)]
*  It's true in even places like Jordan and Kuwait. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=32.84s)]
*  It's certainly true in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=34.82s)]
*  And we love those governments. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=38.36s)]
*  We support those governments. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=40.36s)]
*  We want those kinds of governments to exist. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=41.46s)]
*  So that's obviously not the motive, even though we say it is, to free the Syrian people, to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=43.0s)]
*  eliminate and vanquish dictatorship. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=46.6s)]
*  What then is the reason why so many people in the United States government over several [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  administrations were so devoted to this goal of removing Assad? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=54.56s)]
*  Why was that important to the U.S.? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=59.36s)]
*  Well, as far as I know, I mean, this dates back decades, long before Bashar al-Assad [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  took power. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=66.68s)]
*  It goes back to when his father, Hafez al-Assad, was in power. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=68.08s)]
*  And the reason is clear. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=71.2s)]
*  I mean, this was a nationalist and Arab nationalist government that was always hostile to Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=72.2s)]
*  Syria has always provided at least rhetorical support and some material support, although [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=81.0s)]
*  it's been inconsistent, to Palestinian resistance. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=87.12s)]
*  And so there's been this obsession with taking out the acts of resistance, of which Syria [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=90.0s)]
*  is a member. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=94.52s)]
*  And that's why if you look at the WikiLeaks emails from Hillary Clinton and other people, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=95.52s)]
*  they talk about how overthrowing Assad would be so great for Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=98.64s)]
*  It's because the U.S. and Israel ruled the Middle East by force, by having a monopoly [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=103.08s)]
*  on violence. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=107.64s)]
*  And so their obsession with Hezbollah and Syria and Iran comes down to taking out a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=108.88s)]
*  deterrent to their aggression. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=113.28s)]
*  I think that's ultimately what it comes down to. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=115.52s)]
*  One point about the scenes from Syria, there is, of course, jubilation for many Syrians [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=118.44s)]
*  that Assad is gone, a repressive leader. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  He's part of a dynasty that's ruled over them for 50 years. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=125.36s)]
*  They wanted something new. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=127.64s)]
*  What we're not seeing, though, are the people who are scared for their lives, because, you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=128.64s)]
*  know, just going back to Jelani, when he was leading al-Nusra, they were carrying out massacres [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=132.76s)]
*  in places like Latakia against Alawites. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  An investigation by Human Rights Watch of one such massacre in 2013 found that, you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=141.12s)]
*  know, forces under Jelani's command, Nusra and other insurgent forces, committed systematic [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=146.48s)]
*  destruction of entire families. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  And people in minority groups in Syria, Christians, Druze, Shia, Alawite, many of them are living [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  in fear. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=162.44s)]
*  I mean, I've heard from some people that I know, and they're not joining these scenes [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=163.44s)]
*  of celebration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=167.6s)]
*  They're not joining the scenes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=168.64s)]
*  And we're already seeing some horrific videos coming out of Syria. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=169.64s)]
*  Maybe things will, I'm hoping after all this carnage, maybe everyone is just exhausted [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=173.72s)]
*  of war. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=177.56s)]
*  And maybe Jelani will really realize that it's in his own interest, if not his own ideology, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=178.6s)]
*  it's in his interest to actually stop the sectarianism that has destroyed Syria for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=184.24s)]
*  so long. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=188.44s)]
*  But given how it's gone so far in Syria and also in Iraq and Libya, other successful, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=189.44s)]
*  quote unquote, regime change wars, I'm not feeling very optimistic about that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=193.6s)]
*  The Israelis have achieved a lot of their long time goals in about three days since [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=198.56s)]
*  all of this happened, including making incursions into other parts of the Golan Heights and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=204.28s)]
*  even parts of what the Western media generally calls the buffer zone, meaning Syrian territory, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  which they have now seized, planted Israeli flags in, promise that they intend to keep [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=214.44s)]
*  that indefinitely. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=219.12s)]
*  What do you think is the Israeli view of what's taking place in Syria? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=222.12s)]
*  Because I think instinctively people might say, well, the Israelis have to at least recognize [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=227.88s)]
*  it as a risk that if you have Al-Qaeda and ISIS elements and other hardcore Islamic radicals, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Sunni Islamic radicals who are governing Syria on the other side of the Israeli border, that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=241.16s)]
*  that can pose some risk to them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  But certainly they've benefited already. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=249.44s)]
*  What do you think has been the Israeli posture toward these events? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, then, Yehudi seemed pretty happy about it when he went to the Golan Heights and basically [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=255.48s)]
*  took partial credit for Assad's ouster. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=259.84s)]
*  Talk about what a great thing this was and how this will further weaken Hezbollah and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=261.92s)]
*  Iran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=267.24s)]
*  So he's pleased. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=268.24s)]
*  But yeah, at the same time, when you have a group led by the founding leader of Al-Qaeda [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=269.24s)]
*  taking power on your border, you're going to be worried. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  And also the problem with Syria is also even if Jalani is somehow magically reformed as [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=278.52s)]
*  a moderate now, if he's undergone some transformation, which, by the way, he's never apologized for [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=283.28s)]
*  the atrocities committed under his watch. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=287.76s)]
*  So that's not the reason to be skeptical. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  But let's say he's a reformer now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=291.11999999999995s)]
*  He's moderate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  You still have a lot of groups in Syria that are outside of his control. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  So there is a lot of danger there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=297.2s)]
*  There was an Israeli official who spoke to the New York Times years ago, but during the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  height of the dirty war, who said for us, like the best case scenario is that they just [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  bleed each other to death. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=306.23999999999995s)]
*  They hemorrhage each other to death. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=307.52s)]
*  I think that's what Syria want. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=308.76s)]
*  That's what Israel wanted the most is that just you have this constant conflict inside [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=310.24s)]
*  Syria. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=314.16s)]
*  Everybody destroys themselves. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=315.16s)]
*  Hezbollah gets blood. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=316.16s)]
*  Syria gets weakened. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=318.68s)]
*  So I do think they're happy that Assad is gone, but they now are trying to grapple with [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=320.48s)]
*  what next. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=325.8s)]
*  And just to make sure that Syria can never, ever, ever even think about retaking the Golan [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=326.8s)]
*  Heights, Israel has gone on a bombing spree, bombing areas across the country, destroying [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=330.72s)]
*  Syrian military positions. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=336.32s)]
*  The port of Latakia, they've attacked that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=338.44s)]
*  So although I'm sure they're not convinced that Jelani will be their ally, I think they're [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=341.32s)]
*  also pretty happy with how things have turned out so far. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  And by the way, they were a part of the dirty war. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=351.88s)]
*  They armed anti-government insurgents on the border, and they even treated wounded members [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  of al-Qaeda and ISIS in their hospitals, which shows you, I think, how they might be feeling [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=360.12s)]
*  right now overall about the ouster of Assad. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=365.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I just think it's such a good lesson to be very guarded against anything that we're [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  being convinced of and told about who bad guys are and good guys are, because that can [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=371.88s)]
*  change on a dime so quickly. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  And as you say, whatever else is true, the Israelis seem overtly celebrating the events [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=379.0s)]
*  in Syria, however worried they might be. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=384.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=387.48s)]
*  Last question, Aaron. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=388.48s)]
*  Donald Trump came out with this statement, at which point it was they weren't quite at [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=389.48s)]
*  Damascus. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=393.92s)]
*  They were anti-government rebels, but they were in the suburbs. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=395.36s)]
*  They were clearly headed there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=397.8s)]
*  It was clear by that point that everything, the fall of Assad was a failure. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=398.8s)]
*  And Trump basically came out and said, look, these are not our friends here, neither the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=404.24s)]
*  government that was deposed nor the people coming in. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=409.66s)]
*  We don't have any interest in Syria. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=412.8s)]
*  We need to just stay out and let it all work out, let them work it out. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=415.36s)]
*  It's not really our business. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=419.5s)]
*  What do you make of that statement by Trump? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=420.68s)]
*  Well, the party's missing is his own role. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=425.84s)]
*  He did try to get out, but when he was undermined by his own generals and subordinates, he caved. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=428.36s)]
*  He could have insisted on the US implementing his order to withdraw troops from Syria, but [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=434.4s)]
*  he didn't. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  As soon as he faced some resistance, he backed down. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  And then he announced that we're there to take the oil. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  So he played a role in this by keeping US troops in Syria to loot Syria's oil. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=444.44s)]
*  He also played a role by signing into law the Caesar sanctions that have been devastating [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  for Syria, that have made it very hard for ordinary Syrians and prevented reconstruction, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  as some of the people under Trump openly bragged about. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=457.8s)]
*  So I think Trump has shown that he gets the situation in Syria. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  There's old tweets of his from 2013 and around then where he's saying that the moderate rebels [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=464.72s)]
*  are really ISIS and that the moderate rebels are people who want to fly planes into our [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  buildings. And he's showing that he was aware that we were arming an al-Qaeda dominated [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=474.48s)]
*  insurgency. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=479.12s)]
*  And in 2016, I mean, you know, you know this more than anyone, that when he campaigned, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=480.48s)]
*  he talked about how disastrous the wars in Syria and Libya were under the Obama administration. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=483.96s)]
*  So I agree with his message. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=491.04s)]
*  I think it's too late. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=492.88s)]
*  We are in Syria. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=493.88s)]
*  We do have these sanctions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=495.08s)]
*  The damage has been done now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=496.2s)]
*  The insurgency we helped arm, the sanctions, the military occupation, that has led to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=498.32s)]
*  the chaos of today. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=503.08s)]
*  He does play a small role in it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=504.12s)]
*  Although, of course, the primary responsibility on the US side lies with the current occupants [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  of the White House, Antony Blinken, Joe Biden, Jake Sullivan, Samantha Power, all these people [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=510.08s)]
*  who decided back in 2011 that it was a good idea to have a dirty war in Syria after they [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=515.4s)]
*  had destroyed Libya. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  So we'll see what Trump does. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=522.8s)]
*  JD Vance has been saying some comments that I think also show that he understands the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  situation. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=530.92s)]
*  He made fun of Washington Post columnist John Corbyn saying that the last time this guy [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=531.92s)]
*  was excited about Syria, it got a bunch of Christians killed. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=536.84s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  In Idlib province, which was the stronghold of Jelani and his forces, which he captured, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=541.24s)]
*  which Jelani captured in 2015 with the help of the CIA tacitly. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  After Jelani took power in Idlib, the Christian population went from about 1200 to three, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=552.32s)]
*  to three people, because Jelani's forces drove them out and also massacred Druze. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=557.72s)]
*  And JD Vance seems to recognize that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=562.72s)]
*  So will that reflect a change in policy once Trump takes office? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  If we're going by the history of the Trump administration, no, because for all the awareness [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=570.88s)]
*  Trump had, he didn't do much different policy wise. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=574.48s)]
*  But maybe things now are so bad with a literal al-Qaeda veteran being the de facto leader [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=577.16s)]
*  of Syria that will force the Trump administration to rethink things. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=583.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  And if you talk to a lot of people very close to Trump and Trump world, as I've done both [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  off the show, but also on the show, they'll acknowledge that the worst part of the first [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=592.2800000000001s)]
*  administration was that there were lots of things that Trump believed in, thought should [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=596.5200000000001s)]
*  be done, and he neither lacked the discipline and or the competence to prevent these kind [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  of permanent forces in Washington from sabotaging him. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  To the point where he ordered troops to leave and generals undermined him and they were [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=610.5200000000001s)]
*  celebrated even though there's few things more dangerous to our democracy than undermining [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=615.1600000000001s)]
*  the civilian elected commander in chief by unelected generals. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=621.16s)]
*  That's a military rule. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=624.8s)]
*  And yet all the people who say they love democracy were cheering them for constantly thwarting [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=626.36s)]
*  Trump and they swear that this time Trump is aware of that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=629.8s)]
*  He's more aware of how things work in Washington, how they've been preparing for at least a [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=633.88s)]
*  year to prevent these sorts of people from worming their way into the administration [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=640.12s)]
*  who want to work against Trump's policies rather than in favor of them. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  I remain skeptical given a lot of the people that he's chosen. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  But to me that's the number one question that remains to be seen is you have these instincts [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=652.0s)]
*  that Trump has that are so clearly right opposed to the bipartisan foreign policy consensus, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=656.12s)]
*  but you have a lot of people around him who he's still empowering who seem committed to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=660.48s)]
*  that and whether they're really going to be loyal to Trump this time, whether he's going [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=664.4s)]
*  to be more attentive and concerned about preventing them. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=667.52s)]
*  I think that's the big question for Trump too. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCuEEeoRl84&t=671.32s)]
