# Demsâ€™ Hysteria on Full Display After FBI Arrests Judge
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M)
*  I will now want to get into what we're calling the Week in Review. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=0.0s)]
*  I have a lot of different topics that I want to cover, ones that really were worth covering, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=9.68s)]
*  but as a show that really does just two at the most three topics a night, we often don't [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  get to ones that we wish we could and we're trying to use Friday night as the Week in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=19.6s)]
*  Review to be able to cover those. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  The second part of our show is going to be the Q&A where we get questions from our locals [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=26.52s)]
*  members and try and answer them, but in this case the topic I wanted to begin with just [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=30.78s)]
*  so happens to be one of the most common questions throughout the day. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=35.32s)]
*  We got from locals members including this question from Christiana K. who asked this, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=38.84s)]
*  quote, I would love to hear your thoughts on today's arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan by [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=45.64s)]
*  the FBI. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  Now this is one of the biggest topics, news topics of the day, certainly consuming a lot [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=52.24s)]
*  of news and a lot of commentary. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=59.56s)]
*  It's also generating a lot of hysteria, a lot of inaccurate commentary as well, so I [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  actually did want to address this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  Just to give you the bare bones facts for those of you who haven't heard it, Judge Dugan [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=68.76s)]
*  is a local judge in the county of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=73.8s)]
*  She's a judge in the state court system in Milwaukee, not a very high ranking judge. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=79.76s)]
*  In fact, at what I believe is one of the lowest levels of the judicial system, she was elected [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=84.76s)]
*  and she's somebody who has spent a long time affiliated with working with low income people, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=90.64000000000001s)]
*  which I regard as noble, but also causes generally associated with the left including immigrants. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=96.68s)]
*  She was arrested by the FBI today at her home and obviously that created a lot of shock [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=102.68s)]
*  because this was the FBI going and arresting a sitting judge in Wisconsin who clearly is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  a political opponent or someone with ideological views that differ from the administration. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=117.78s)]
*  The arrest was originally announced by FBI Director Cash Patel and a lot of people became [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  instantly alarmed for reasons I guess are understandable, saying, wow, this is a huge [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  escalation where the Trump administration is now arresting judges. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  The implication was, especially from a lot of Democrats, I don't mean like Democratic [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=142.96s)]
*  random commentators, I mean from major Democratic party leaders in DC and a lot of media personalities [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  who are Democratic, they were essentially trying to claim that this was some huge red [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  line that had just been crossed because this was an instance of the Trump administration [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=157.94s)]
*  now weaponizing the FBI to arrest judges for issuing orders they dislike. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=162.58s)]
*  If it were that, if this were the FBI, say going to one of the judges that have been [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=168.1s)]
*  ruling against the Trump administration, issuing rulings that certain Trump administration [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=172.9s)]
*  policies are unconstitutional or issuing injunctions and the FBI went to their chambers with their [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  home to arrest them as punishment for or a response to a judicial ruling that they issued [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  in the course of their judicial work, I would be as alarmist as the English language permits. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=189.38s)]
*  I would actually consider that to be a major escalation of the civil liberties threats [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=194.82s)]
*  that as you I think know, I believe are genuine over the past three months that we're seeing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=201.38s)]
*  But that's not what happened today. This is not a case where this judge issued an adverse [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=208.02s)]
*  ruling and for that reason the FBI went and arrested the judge as a lot of people were [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=214.5s)]
*  attempting to apply. I just want to note it's not that uncommon for judges to be arrested. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=219.38s)]
*  Judges commit crimes all the time. The FBI catches judges taking bribes or embezzling money [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=226.18s)]
*  or engaging in judicial corruption or on the state level election corruption. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  There are all sorts of judges who have been arrested, who have been prosecuted, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=240.5s)]
*  who have been sentenced to prison, who are sitting in prison now. Judges are [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=243.46s)]
*  not any more above the law than anybody else. So the mere fact that the FBI arrested a judge [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  doesn't make this a political scandal or a cause for alarm. Obviously if a judge breaks into [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  somebody's house and steals, if they rape somebody, if they're caught engaging in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=260.5s)]
*  pedophilia, if they murder, etc., etc., if they engage in tax evasion, if they're taking a bribe, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=264.98s)]
*  they ought to be arrested and are arrested. It's really not out of the ordinary event. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=269.86s)]
*  Not saying judges get arrested every day, but it's not that it happens once every century either. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=274.26s)]
*  So the question then becomes what was the reason for the arrest? What was the basis for the arrest? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=281.54s)]
*  Was it as punishment for a judge who issued a ruling that the Trump administration disliked, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=286.9s)]
*  which as I said would be on the far end of the extremist wing of what would justify alarmism, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=294.73999999999995s)]
*  and that's what a lot of Democratic senators and other media figures tried to depict it as [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  being to scare people, oh Trump is now arresting sitting judges. Obviously there's a context for [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=306.02s)]
*  this which is the Trump administration has been very loud in its grievance about what they regard [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=311.94s)]
*  as the inappropriate rulings of federal judges, the excessive assertions of power over what the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=316.9s)]
*  president is doing, and so they made it seem like, oh now the Trump administration isn't just [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=324.02s)]
*  complaining about this, they're actually going and arresting them. And as I said, had it been that, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=328.18s)]
*  I would spend my whole show on that, not just this show, but many shows. But that's not what [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=334.74s)]
*  happened. Pam Bondi, the attorney general who supervises as attorney general the FBI, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=340.58s)]
*  went on the Fox News today and this is the explanation she gave about the series of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=347.94s)]
*  events that led the FBI to arrest Judge Dugan in Milwaukee. And to set the stage for you and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  Sandra, this was truly horrific. This guy was in court being prosecuted by a state prosecutor [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=362.5s)]
*  for domestic violence battery. He had beat up two people, a guy and a girl, beat the guy, hit the guy [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=368.9s)]
*  30 times, knocked him to the ground, choked him, beat up a woman. So badly they both had to go to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=375.94s)]
*  the hospital. And John, you know, it's so rare for victims to want to cooperate. They wanted to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  cooperate. They were sitting in the courtroom with the state prosecutor. The judge learns that ICE was [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=385.78s)]
*  outside to get the guy because he had been deported in 2013, came back in our country, commits these [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=392.1s)]
*  crimes, charged with committing these crimes, victims in court. Judge finds out she goes out [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=397.86s)]
*  in the hallway, screams at the immigration officers. She's furious, visibly shaken, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=403.06s)]
*  upset, sends them off to talk to the chief judge. She comes back in the courtroom, you're going to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  believe this, takes the defendant and the defense attorney back in her chambers, takes them out of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=414.02000000000004s)]
*  private exit and tells them to leave while a state prosecutor and victims of domestic violence are [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=419.3s)]
*  sitting in the courtroom. Now, let me just issue an important caution, which is that Pam Boddy is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=425.62s)]
*  a prosecutor. She works, she's the attorney general of the United States, the highest ranking [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=433.38s)]
*  prosecutor in the country. And the FBI is a law enforcement agency. And in our country, one of the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=438.5s)]
*  responsibilities of citizenship is that we don't just assume that the version of events offered by [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=444.82s)]
*  the FBI or the police or the prosecutor is actually the full story, the accurate story, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=450.58s)]
*  the correct story. So there's no chance I'm going to sit here and say, oh, this judge committed a [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=456.9s)]
*  crime. I want to hear from the judge. I want to hear from her lawyer. I want to hear the, I want [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=462.09999999999997s)]
*  to see the evidence being examined and tested with witnesses in a court. And only then will, at least [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=467.06s)]
*  I be willing to opine on whether there was really a crime committed here. But what is the case [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=474.02s)]
*  is that the FBI's theory or the attorney general, the DOJ's theory about why this judge got arrested [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  was that she committed what is in fact a crime, whether you think it should be or not, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=489.85999999999996s)]
*  which is that if the government is looking for somebody in order to arrest them or detain them [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  and you do something actively to obstruct law enforcement from being able to find them, if you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=503.06s)]
*  help the person escape, if you hide them, if you lie to law enforcement about where they are so that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=510.42s)]
*  they don't find them, that's a crime in every state in the country and in a federal court. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=516.18s)]
*  Now, there is a context here, an important context, which is we have this very odd situation. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=524.34s)]
*  In the United States where you have on the one hand the federal government that is charged with [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=531.7s)]
*  enforcing immigration laws and this is not just under Trump. I mean in fact immigrant rights [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=538.82s)]
*  groups called Obama the deporter in chief, Obama deported millions of people who had entered the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=547.3000000000001s)]
*  country illegally, millions. And that's done through Homeland Security, through through [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=552.98s)]
*  ICE and through the other agencies charged with enforcing immigration laws by finding and detaining [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=560.5799999999999s)]
*  and then deporting people who are in the country illegally. That's a legitimate function of the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  federal government. And then on the other hand you have states and cities, and Milwaukee is an [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  example of such a city that had declared themselves to be sanctuary cities, by which they mean that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=580.26s)]
*  if there's a person who's in the country illegally, who Milwaukee becomes aware of, for example, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=587.14s)]
*  let's say there's a person who's in the country illegally and they're raped and they call the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=593.22s)]
*  police and the police in the course of talking to the person discovers, oh they're not a citizen, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=599.14s)]
*  they're in the country illegally, the rape victim is. Or let's say that there's a murder on a street [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=603.38s)]
*  and one of the witnesses is a person in the country illegally and they go and talk to the police, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=609.6999999999999s)]
*  and the police discover the person is in the country illegally but still wants them to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=614.18s)]
*  serve as a witness to this murder. Or let's say there's an older person in the country illegally, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=620.18s)]
*  been here for a while, has a heart attack, a stroke, shows up at an emergency room in a public hospital [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  and in the course of getting their papers and the like, the medical staff, the hospital staff, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=635.62s)]
*  discovers they're in the country illegally. Ordinarily if a government or law enforcement [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=640.58s)]
*  discovers that someone has committed a crime, they notify the relevant law enforcement agency, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=644.5s)]
*  which would be ICE. Oh we found this person, they are in the country illegally, come get them. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=649.3000000000001s)]
*  What a lot of cities have done though is declare themselves to be sanctuary cities because their [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=657.94s)]
*  argument is that they're in the country illegally. So let's say there's a person who's in the country [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=662.0200000000001s)]
*  illegally, their argument is we don't want people in our city who are in the country illegally to be [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=668.9s)]
*  hiding. We want them to come forward if they're a victim of a crime without fearing they're going [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=673.6999999999999s)]
*  to be detained. We want them to come forward if they're a witness to a crime. We want them [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=677.86s)]
*  to seek medical attention if they're or someone in their family is in the middle of some serious [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=681.78s)]
*  medical crisis. That's a policy decision that cities and states through their elected officials [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=689.14s)]
*  have made. But you see the tension this creates. You have on the one hand the government searching for [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=694.74s)]
*  and wanting to detain and deport, especially now, people in the country illegally. But a lot of these [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  people are in these so-called sanctuary cities where these states and cities have said we're [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=706.66s)]
*  not going to help the federal government. That's the other things. Even if ICE finds out that there's [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=713.78s)]
*  some person in the country illegally they want to detain in say New York City or Chicago or Milwaukee, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=718.82s)]
*  the police in those cities will not cooperate with ICE. They will not help people find help [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=723.9399999999999s)]
*  the federal government find illegal aliens. So this is a kind of passive policy. It's saying we're [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=729.54s)]
*  not going to help the federal government. We're not going to report people because we don't want [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=737.6199999999999s)]
*  people living underground, petrified that if they seek police help or medical help or send their [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=742.0999999999999s)]
*  kids to school, all things we want them to do, we don't want them petrified that we're going to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=750.02s)]
*  turn them over the minute that they stick their head up. So that's already a strange conflict. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=753.78s)]
*  That is the policy of the federal government to find them, detain them, and deport them. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=761.46s)]
*  The policy of states and cities to basically harbor them, to give them sanctuary as that says. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=764.9s)]
*  And in that case there's probably no real legal liability on the part of the state or the city [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=772.5799999999999s)]
*  because what they're really saying in those cases is we're just not going to help. We're not going [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=779.06s)]
*  to call the government. We're not going to snitch on these people. We're not going to tattle on them. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=784.3399999999999s)]
*  We're not going to expend resources to turn them over. But the question becomes what happens [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=787.54s)]
*  if a city official or a state official doesn't just passively refuse to help the federal [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=793.6999999999999s)]
*  government but actively seeks to obstruct what they're trying to do. So ICE agents show up in [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=800.5s)]
*  New York City and say, hey, we know this person is here and we want to go get them. And then city [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=807.46s)]
*  officials say to the person that they're after, hey, come here. Let's hide you because they're [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=814.6600000000001s)]
*  coming after you. Now the city officials aren't just engaged in passive non-cooperation. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=819.86s)]
*  They are instead engaged in active impediments, actively impeding or obstructing what the federal [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=826.58s)]
*  government under the law is attempting to do. And Trump's immigration czar, Tom Holman, this is one [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=833.38s)]
*  of the things he has said from the start is if we find any city or state officials actively impeding [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=839.78s)]
*  or obstructing or harboring or hiding people in the country illegally that we're trying to detain [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=847.7s)]
*  and arrest, we will prosecute them because that is a crime. Let me just take it out of the immigration [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=853.62s)]
*  context for a second just to illustrate the point. Let's say there's somebody who robs a bank [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=860.9s)]
*  and you know they robbed a bank, you didn't help them rob the bank, you didn't even know they were [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=866.42s)]
*  going to rob the bank beforehand but now you know they robbed the bank and that the police are after [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=870.8199999999999s)]
*  them. They're a fugitive from justice. If you tell the person, hey, come hide in my basement [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=874.5799999999999s)]
*  so that the police can't find you or you give them money in a car to be able to flee, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=882.34s)]
*  you are absolutely committing the crime, a crime of helping a fugitive flee justice, impeding or [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=887.22s)]
*  obstructing justice. These are just ordinary crimes and I've confronted this many times before. In fact, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=896.02s)]
*  when we went to Hong Kong to meet Edward Snowden to do the reporting, we were always very concerned [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=902.74s)]
*  about what was going to happen to him after he had to leave Hong Kong. Like where was he going to go? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=910.02s)]
*  We tried to talk to him about that. He said, I don't care about that, I'm not the issue, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=914.58s)]
*  work on the journalism and I'll take care of that myself but we had felt like we had a [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=919.14s)]
*  responsibility to him so I was working at the Guardian at the time. I called the Guardian, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=923.14s)]
*  their lawyers came to Hong Kong, we were talking about how we could help him and the U.S. government [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=926.74s)]
*  and the British government made very clear that if we take steps to try and hide Snowden to help him [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=931.14s)]
*  get out of Hong Kong, to help him get to safety, they would regard our behavior as criminal because [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=935.38s)]
*  now we're aiding and abetting a fugitive from justice. This is not a radical theory of [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=940.18s)]
*  criminality that the Trump administration today invented in order to arrest this judge. So if this [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=947.4599999999999s)]
*  judge knew that ICE agents had come to the courthouse because the person they wanted to detain was in [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=953.6999999999999s)]
*  court as a criminal defendant accused of domestic assault and battery, which was the charge against [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=963.54s)]
*  him, and then the judge upon learning that ICE agents were out in the hallway, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=971.06s)]
*  adjourned her court, adjourned the proceeding in order to whisper to the defendant and his lawyer, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=977.2199999999999s)]
*  hey come here, come to my secret chambers, there's an exit that you should take, that secret that's [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=984.02s)]
*  private that will allow you to get away. If that's really what she did, and again I'm not assuming [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=989.86s)]
*  that she did that, but if that's really what she did, this does start to seem to me like more of an [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=996.1s)]
*  ordinary criminal offense than it does some political abuse of power designed to take retaliation [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1001.22s)]
*  against judges. If you did what that judge did, you would also get arrested. People have been arrested [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1009.78s)]
*  before for harboring or helping escape not just criminals in general but people in the country [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1017.7s)]
*  illegally as well. It's considered a crime and the idea is just because she's a judge doesn't make [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1022.9000000000001s)]
*  what she did any less criminal. Just like judges are arrested all the time for common crimes like [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1028.02s)]
*  bribery and all the other things I've said. So when I heard that a Trump administration, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1033.06s)]
*  when I heard Cash Patel as FBI director go on to Twitter and say we just arrested this federal [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1039.22s)]
*  judge, I, as a state judge, I obviously was alarmed. Like the FBI arresting a judge in an [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1044.34s)]
*  immigration case seems like it has the potential for the abuse of power, but then once you hear the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1052.4199999999998s)]
*  allegations and there's affidavits and other things, you understand that at least if the set of facts [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1057.06s)]
*  alleged by the FBI is accurate, then this is far from the sort of political [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1064.58s)]
*  scandal that a lot of Democrats were trying to make it out to be. And this is the problem that [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1074.4199999999998s)]
*  I have with Democrats for a long time is one of the biggest gifts that they give to Trump [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1078.82s)]
*  is that they seem incapable ever of criticizing him without using maximalist language. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1084.98s)]
*  Everything is a threat to democracy. Everything is fascism. Everything is [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1092.6599999999999s)]
*  Nazi-like or Hitler-like or some sort of drastic deviation from the norm, even when that's not true. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1097.9399999999998s)]
*  And that creates the boy who cries wolf syndrome. I do think there are things the Trump administration [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1109.6999999999998s)]
*  is doing that are serious threats to basic civil liberties. We've talked about them a lot on this [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1114.9799999999998s)]
*  show, but the reason I feel confident to talk about them is because I have not somebody who has [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1120.9s)]
*  or will ever just instantly react to everything the Trump administration does with this deranged [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1127.22s)]
*  kind of chicken running around with its head cut off rhetoric that a lot of Democrats instantly use. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1135.8600000000001s)]
*  And again, the problem is that if you call what everything he does fascist or a threat to democracy [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1141.5400000000002s)]
*  on the times he really does do those things, people will tune out that rhetoric. It's similar [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1146.66s)]
*  to overusing the racism accusation or the anti-Semitism accusation. If you just start [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1151.14s)]
*  throwing that around almost reflexively, people are going to tune it out so that when it really [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1157.6200000000001s)]
*  merits that term, it will have lost its impact. Same with a lot of this rhetoric. So here is, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1163.22s)]
*  so many Democrats sounded exactly the same today. Here is Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1168.8200000000002s)]
*  in response to this story who wrote, quote, this is not normal. The administrations of arrest of a [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1176.26s)]
*  sitting judge in Wisconsin is a drastic move that threatens the rule of law. While we don't have all [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1182.58s)]
*  the details, this is a grave step and undermines our system of checks and balances. Okay, the act [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1189.54s)]
*  of arresting a sitting judge is not in and of itself a drastic move. Everything depends on what [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1195.46s)]
*  is it that she did or has said to have done that led to the arrest. So when she says while we don't [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1203.78s)]
*  have all the details, this is a grave step and undermines our system of checks and balances, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1210.98s)]
*  no it doesn't. Not if she actually took action that is plausibly within the realm of criminality. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1215.62s)]
*  And so she's using this language in a way that's utterly inappropriate from the set of facts as we [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  know them. Here's from Mark Levine who's the Manhattan borough president in New York. He went [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1229.14s)]
*  on to Twitter today. There was some Democratic operative for media matters who said Trump's FBI [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1237.46s)]
*  just arrested a sitting judge. No other details, just trying to make it seem like they're going [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1245.3000000000002s)]
*  around randomly arresting judges. And Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, the Democrat said [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1249.38s)]
*  this is North Korea level scary. Now again, I think this rhetoric would be appropriate if [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1254.9s)]
*  this were being done as retaliation for some ruling that this judge issued. But if the judge [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1262.3400000000001s)]
*  did what they claim she did or anything like it, then this is totally inappropriate rhetoric. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1268.66s)]
*  And I say that as someone who believes there are very grave civil liberties threats that have been [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1274.42s)]
*  posed by certain Trump administration policies, this isn't one of them. And if the accusations [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1279.06s)]
*  are untrue, then they'll fall apart in a court. If this isn't really what the judge did, if she [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1286.1s)]
*  did something else besides what the FBI thinks she did or is claiming she did, that's what courts are [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1291.06s)]
*  for. But this is a case of actual criminal allegations based on an actual criminal statute [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1297.3s)]
*  that has been applied many times to many other people. And to use this kind of rhetoric [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1304.82s)]
*  instantly without knowing anything, just again, is what does Trump the biggest favors because then [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1312.98s)]
*  when people like me who are much more restrained with this kind of rhetoric and try and be much [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1317.54s)]
*  more discriminating about when we raise civil liberties concerns, like when it's actually [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1321.6200000000001s)]
*  deserved, when it really is something unprecedented, try and convince people that it's true, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1324.9s)]
*  a lot of people will understandably tune out because this is the kind of language Democrats [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1329.54s)]
*  have been using for 10 years against Trump. From the smallest and most trivial stories to the biggest [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1333.94s)]
*  to everything in between. So we'll see how this plays out. I understand that it can be an [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1340.5s)]
*  intimidating message to judges in immigration cases. They probably want that message to be sent [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1348.74s)]
*  because there's another judge in Arizona that just got arrested earlier this week because he was [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1354.5800000000002s)]
*  actually harboring someone illegally in his house who the government claims is a member of Trend El [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1358.5s)]
*  Ragua. And they probably want to tell judges like, look, it's one thing if you're part of a sanctuary [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1364.98s)]
*  city and you're not going to help us. We're not going to like it. We're not going to be happy about [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1370.74s)]
*  it. But okay, that's one thing. We can't force you to cooperate. But if you actively impede us, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1375.14s)]
*  yes. We're going to consider that a crime. They have said this many times. And so we'll see how [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1381.94s)]
*  this case plays out. But either way, it does not warrant this hair on fire melodramatic language [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1388.3400000000001s)]
*  that a lot of people quite counterproductively are giving it. All right, we're going to get into the [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1393.22s)]
*  Q&A in just a second. But before we do, here is a news story. Mexico extradites 29 drug traffickers [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1400.98s)]
*  to the US to avoid trade tariffs. We all know how deceptive mainstream media can be. They push [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1407.46s)]
*  agendas, censor voices, and make sure you only see one side of the story. That's exactly why I [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1411.78s)]
*  started this show because I believe in free speech and real conversations and the most open and [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1416.42s)]
*  unconstrained pursuit of the truth possible. It's also why I partnered with an app and website that [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1421.78s)]
*  believes in that too. Ground News prioritizes free speech over controlling the narrative. For every [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1426.98s)]
*  story, you can find all the articles reporting on it worldwide with contacts, like if a news [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1432.66s)]
*  source has any political bias, how credible they are, and if any major corporation is influencing [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1438.1s)]
*  their reporting. All I have to do is swipe through coverage with tags, their tags indicating if it's [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1442.8999999999999s)]
*  coming from a liberal or conservative source or from corporations or independent voices. And from [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1447.86s)]
*  there, I can decide for myself if, for example, Mexico's unprecedented extradition of 29 cartel [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1452.34s)]
*  members to the US really is proof that Trump's terror tactics are working, like some of his [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1458.82s)]
*  defenders claim, or if it's just a routine legal process and one of the cartel members pled not [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1463.3799999999999s)]
*  guilty anyway and it's just an ordinary event between the two countries as many center and left [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1468.6599999999999s)]
*  sources are insisting. Different sources are saying different things as usual. If I just read one of [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1475.06s)]
*  these sources, I'd have a skewed view of reality, but with Ground News, I can put them side by side [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1480.34s)]
*  and decide for myself who's actually telling the truth. Ground News even created a dedicated feed [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1485.54s)]
*  called Blind Spot that exposes stories that either side of the political spectrum isn't reporting on, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1490.9s)]
*  making it possible to spot stories that people in charge don't want you to see. Ground News is [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifoAVDVR6M&t=1496.02s)]
