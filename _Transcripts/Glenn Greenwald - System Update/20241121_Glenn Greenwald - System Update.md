# Why does the U.S. continue to isolate itself from the rest of the world in order to shield Israel?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk)
*  And the question that I would submit to you is why does the US government continue to throw away its own moral standing in the world, a vital form of soft power for our government and to allow China to intensify its argument with much greater efficiency and persuasiveness that the US is a bad actor in the world, a rogue country that just does what it wants on its own and uses its military force to throw around and do so. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk&t=0.0s)]
*  Why is this one foreign country so worth giving up so much for? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk&t=21.64s)]
*  $4 billion every year right out the door, paying for all their wars, paying for their military, giving them everything they want, protecting them in every way, vowing publicly with loyalty oaths to always do anything that Israel demands, members of both political parties. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk&t=25.16s)]
*  Why? Why? Why does this continue to happen? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  If you really want the answer, you can read the great book in 2006 called The Israel Abbey by Professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, really asking a rhetorical question. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk&t=40.2s)]
*  We've covered this many times before. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk&t=49.08s)]
*  One of the key anchors of the Israel lobby, AIPAC, celebrated this veto today and gave the US government, the Biden administration, a pat on the head for their compliant behavior. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk&t=50.44s)]
*  Here's AIPAC tweeting, thank you, US ambassador to the UN for vetoing this morally bankrupt Security Council resolution. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje9yS5zLVk&t=62.68s)]
