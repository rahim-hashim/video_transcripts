# Niall Ferguson V.S. Scott Horton: Did The U.S. Provoke The Ukraine War?: ZeroHedge Debate Special
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE)
*  Hey everybody, it is Tuesday December 10th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a new episode of System Update, our live nightly show that airs every Monday [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=8.4s)]
*  through Friday at 7 p.m. Eastern exclusively here on Rumble, the free speech alternative [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  to YouTube. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=17.02s)]
*  We have a special episode for you tonight of System Update. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=18.02s)]
*  We have a debate that is about the war in Ukraine and specifically what role the United [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  States and NATO played in provoking the Russian invasion. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=26.36s)]
*  The debate is between Scott Horton, who was previously on our show. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  He's a longtime anti-war writer, somebody who has just written a book entitled Unprovoked [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=33.699999999999996s)]
*  about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=38.42s)]
*  That goes into detail. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=43.62s)]
*  The argument as to why many people around the world believe that the United States and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=44.62s)]
*  NATO are responsible for the provocation about war. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=48.26s)]
*  And on the other side, we have Mial Ferguson, who is a well-known professor and a fellow [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=51.22s)]
*  at the Hoover Institution in Harvard. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=56.2s)]
*  He argues that the United States played no role in provoking the Russian invasion, whereas [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=58.32s)]
*  Scott Horton argues that it did. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=62.04s)]
*  It was originally filmed and scheduled for Zero Hedge. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=63.88s)]
*  We want to thank them and our friend, the show, Liam Cosgrove, for permission to show [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=68.52s)]
*  it to you tonight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=73.12s)]
*  We found it to be a particularly provocative and revealing debate about an issue that we [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=74.12s)]
*  have long covered. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=77.88s)]
*  And while I have you, we're about to show you that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=79.28s)]
*  But tomorrow night, we won't have a normal show either. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=81.0s)]
*  I'll be participating in the debate that originally I was going to go to New York for. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=83.68s)]
*  It is about the question of presidential immunity, specifically whether or not the Supreme Court [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  ruled correctly several months ago when it ruled that Donald Trump enjoys presidential [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=93.64s)]
*  immunity, as do all U.S. presidents, for any acts undertaken as part of his presidential [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=98.2s)]
*  powers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm arguing against that proposition that is actually quite damaging to allow this form [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  of presidential immunity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  And we will have that tomorrow night. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  I will be debating Elizabeth Price Foley, who is a law professor at the University of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  Florida in Miami. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=119.56s)]
*  I will be arguing against that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=120.8s)]
*  You'll be able to watch that tomorrow night at 6 30 p.m. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=122.44s)]
*  Eastern on the link on the description. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=125.16s)]
*  So that will be for tomorrow night. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  In lieu of our normal show here, we will have the link for you to watch the debate on the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  question of whether or not presidents should be immunized from power. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=134.88s)]
*  And here is from prosecution for anything they do in office that's part of their presidential [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=137.28s)]
*  power, even if it's a crime. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=142.16s)]
*  And here is the debate between Scott Horton and Yael Ferguson from Zero Hedge on the question [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=143.72s)]
*  of whether or not the war in Ukraine was provoked. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=148.48s)]
*  Enjoy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=150.44s)]
*  Welcome to the Zero Hedge debate sponsored by JM Bullion. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=157.32s)]
*  I'm Peter Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow at the Hoover Institution at [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=160.16s)]
*  Stanford University. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=164.28s)]
*  For the next 60 minutes, I will be moderating this debate or at least strongly felt conversation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=166.16s)]
*  The director of the Libertarian Institute, Scott Horton, is a radio host and author. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=172.88s)]
*  Scott's most recent book published this year provoked how Washington started the new Cold [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=176.88s)]
*  War with Russia and the catastrophe in Ukraine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=182.48s)]
*  Scott, welcome. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=186.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=187.44s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=188.44s)]
*  Yael Ferguson is a historian and author and, like me, a fellow at the Hoover Institution. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=189.44s)]
*  Yael's most recent book published in 2021, Doom, the Politics of Catastrophe. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=193.56s)]
*  Two men with catastrophe in your most recent titles. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=199.88s)]
*  This will be cheerful. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=202.36s)]
*  Neil is currently working on the second volume of his biography of Henry Kissinger. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=203.36s)]
*  I should note that as all the world learned when 60 Minutes aired this past Sunday, Neil [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=207.24s)]
*  is also a trustee at the new University of Austin in Texas. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=211.2s)]
*  Our format, the format I have in mind, object if you wish to, either of you right up at [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=217.52s)]
*  the top, is simple and conversational. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=221.8s)]
*  I'll ask one or the other of you a question, giving you plenty of time to reply. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=224.68s)]
*  Once one or the other has replied, the other gets a chance to reply in turn and then on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=229.52s)]
*  to the next question. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=234.8s)]
*  You should feel completely free to talk to each other, ask each other questions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=236.12s)]
*  If you start to talk over each other, I'll intercede. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=240.4s)]
*  Otherwise I'll stay out of it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=243.0s)]
*  Fair? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=244.44s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=245.44s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=247.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=248.24s)]
*  Three sentences of background. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=249.24s)]
*  In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, part of Ukraine. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=250.24s)]
*  And in February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, moving not just on Eastern Europe, Ukraine, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=254.24s)]
*  but bombing sites across the country and sending troops all the way to the capital city of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=260.32s)]
*  Kiev. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=264.36s)]
*  The invasion failed, but Russia has occupied about one-fifth of the territory of Ukraine [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=265.36s)]
*  holding Crimea and much of the Donbas in Eastern Ukraine. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=271.24s)]
*  Today it seems to me fair to say that the conflict has settled into a war of attrition. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=275.52s)]
*  For Scott Horton, who started it? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=282.0s)]
*  Scott, you have condemned the invasion of Ukraine, but as you argue in the title of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=286.32s)]
*  your book, it was provoked. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=292.6s)]
*  I'll come in a moment to the detailed expansion of NATO step by step and have you take us [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=295.12s)]
*  through that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=299.7s)]
*  But if you could give an overview statement of the ways in which you believe Russia was [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=300.7s)]
*  provoked. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=305.12s)]
*  Well, to go back to the way you originally stated who started it, the point is that American [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=307.12s)]
*  policy has made the answer to that question very complicated and not just clear cut. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=313.76s)]
*  So of course, no one's denying that Putin and his men made a decision, Putin himself [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  and his men obeying him, made a decision to escalate the war by 10,000 percent in February [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=325.16s)]
*  of 2022 with a massive invasion, as I say, a catastrophe for Ukraine since then. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=331.24s)]
*  So there's no question about what happened there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=339.52s)]
*  And frankly, I don't think there's much question that Russian forces were involved in the civil [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=342.12s)]
*  war after it broke out in the summer of 2014 and a little bit later in early 2015. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=347.36s)]
*  But now as you expanded the question, the antecedents, right, and this is what the great [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=354.58s)]
*  historian Robert Higgs said about World War Two, as they always truncate the antecedents. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  So my job is going back and elongating them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=365.52s)]
*  So the book starts with H.W. Bush and the end of the last Cold War. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=369.2s)]
*  And before Bill Clinton ever came to town, the plan always was to expand NATO at Russia's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=373.94s)]
*  expense, but to lie to them, to tell them that we're not going to expand NATO or if [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=379.64s)]
*  we do, it won't matter because NATO won't be a military alliance anymore. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  It'll be a political organization. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=389.16s)]
*  We're going to create a new partnership for peace. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=391.16s)]
*  And you and Ukraine will be in it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=393.56s)]
*  So Ukraine will be neutral and Russia will be a full partner because there's no threat. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=395.44s)]
*  We don't need an alliance. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=399.12s)]
*  All we need is a security partnership arrangement and we'll have a common European home and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=400.68s)]
*  everything will be fine. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=405.98s)]
*  But they were lying all along. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=407.04s)]
*  They knew that that was not the plan. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  The plan was always to use the CSCE and the Partnership for Peace as a halfway house, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=410.56s)]
*  essentially, toward NATO membership. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=418.32s)]
*  They knew they had to essentially shine Yeltsin on Gorbachev and then Yeltsin on. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=421.12s)]
*  When you say they knew, you're talking about successive American administrations, correct? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, even in the H.W. Bush administration, they began knowing that they would have to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=432.24s)]
*  let the Russians believe that we, as Bush's solemn promise, we will not take advantage [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=437.52s)]
*  of your withdrawal from Eastern Europe. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=445.32s)]
*  Could I pause you there because I'll come right back to you because this detailed history, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=448.4s)]
*  each administration successively expanding NATO, we have to go into that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=455.12s)]
*  I'll return to you. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=458.48s)]
*  But Neil, Scott has given us his theme. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=459.8s)]
*  What's yours? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=464.52s)]
*  Well, let's just dismiss the notion that there was a promise not to enlarge NATO, shall we? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=465.52s)]
*  This originates in a conversation that Jim Baker had with Mikhail Gorbachev in February [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=476.92s)]
*  1990, just after the fall of the Berlin Wall. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=486.92s)]
*  In that conversation, Baker asked, would you prefer to see a united Germany outside of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=491.92s)]
*  NATO, independent and with no U.S. forces, or would you prefer a unified Germany to be [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=499.12s)]
*  tied to NATO with assurances that NATO's jurisdiction would not shift one inch eastward [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=504.24s)]
*  from its present position? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  Baker's words. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  Correct. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=512.4s)]
*  Gorbachev said that he would prefer the latter. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=513.4s)]
*  Baker seemed to agree. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=516.44s)]
*  But when he went back to D.C., Secretary Baker was given an earful by President George H.W. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=518.64s)]
*  Bush, who said, to hell with that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=527.44s)]
*  We prevailed and they didn't. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=530.84s)]
*  We can't let the Soviets clutch victory from the jaws of defeat. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=533.24s)]
*  And that was the end of not one inch. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=537.36s)]
*  So when Putin, as he repeatedly has claimed, says that there was a promise, that isn't [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=541.92s)]
*  actually good history. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=549.0s)]
*  If I may finish, it was something that Baker discussed with Gorbachev, but never became [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=553.8s)]
*  the policy of the Bush administration because Bush never for one second countenanced it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=559.32s)]
*  Secondly, and this is a thing that people like Scott tend to miss, there are other actors [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=565.24s)]
*  in the drama besides Russia and the United States. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=574.5200000000001s)]
*  The former Warsaw Pact members and Soviet republics had an interest and agency too. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=578.92s)]
*  And they wanted to be in NATO. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=589.68s)]
*  They did not want some alternative security arrangement for the very good reason that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  they understood, Lech Walesa, for example, the Polish leader, that anything less than [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=601.52s)]
*  NATO would not give them security. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=607.08s)]
*  So this is the reality, that the countries that joined NATO were not forced into it by [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=610.24s)]
*  the United States. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=617.48s)]
*  They wanted to join NATO and the United States was not really in a position to decline their [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=618.56s)]
*  request. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=623.8s)]
*  There was, of course, a heated debate at the time. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=624.8s)]
*  There were those, George Kennan, for example, who argued that NATO enlargement was a mistake. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=627.8s)]
*  But it was the policy of the US government of successive presidents beginning with George [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=634.7199999999999s)]
*  HW Bush and crucially to my mind it was what the Central and East Europeans wanted. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=638.52s)]
*  Scott, back to you. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=644.12s)]
*  Could we, so, can I address what you just said there real quick? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=646.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, of course, of course. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=650.4799999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=651.7199999999999s)]
*  OK, so on the last point, no one ever argued that America forced the Eastern European countries [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  to join. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=657.8s)]
*  Of course they wanted to join. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=658.8s)]
*  The question was, why would America do what they wanted instead of what was good for America [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=659.8s)]
*  as a national interest, which was, as Kennan and Buchanan and so many others warned at [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=664.66s)]
*  the time, was making sure that our relationship with Moscow was copacetic. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=669.54s)]
*  Who cares about Warsaw? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=674.3399999999999s)]
*  What matters is that we get along with the Russians for the long term and they're sacrificing [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=676.06s)]
*  that much more important long-term good for the short-term interests, including what the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=681.86s)]
*  Eastern European nations wanted. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=689.42s)]
*  On the previous point, pardon me, but that is just bad history. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=690.94s)]
*  Yes, you're right about the one meeting between Baker and Gorbachev on February the 9th, but [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=694.5400000000001s)]
*  there were numerous meetings and I demonstrate this in my book. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=700.3000000000001s)]
*  I have 7,800 citations and including hundreds on this topic where this all began in Malta [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=703.22s)]
*  when HW Bush promised Gorbachev himself, the president promised, we will not take advantage [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  of your withdrawal at all. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=718.1s)]
*  That was it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=720.22s)]
*  And Jack Matlock, the second to last ambassador to the USSR, has explained that, including [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=721.22s)]
*  personally to me, that that was all encompassing. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=726.98s)]
*  And you mentioned others involved. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=729.98s)]
*  How about Gentrure? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=731.82s)]
*  How about Robert Gates made the same promise to the head of the KGB the same day that Baker [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=733.1s)]
*  was making that offer to Gorbachev? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=738.78s)]
*  And how about the fact that Gentrure, who was the foreign minister of Germany, West [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=741.22s)]
*  much a partner in all this, repeatedly vowed that NATO would not expand not only into eastern [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=746.94s)]
*  Germany but to any nation east of Germany either. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=751.98s)]
*  And in the final treaty that they did sign, what they did was they came up with, because [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=755.74s)]
*  you're right, that Bush said that Baker's plan made no sense. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=760.5400000000001s)]
*  How can you bring Germany into NATO, reunify Germany, but not have East Germany into NATO? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=763.74s)]
*  Even just as a sentence, it doesn't make sense. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=770.7600000000001s)]
*  So what they decided was, of course, East Germany will be part of NATO, but we promised [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=773.14s)]
*  not to expand any of our military presence into the former GDR. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=776.98s)]
*  Now, if the deal always was that, of course, we can bring Poland and the Baltics into NATO [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=781.66s)]
*  next and put bases there, then why would it matter if we were allowed to put troops in [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=786.46s)]
*  eastern Germany? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=792.38s)]
*  The entire and pardon me one more thing. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=794.02s)]
*  The the entire discussion, and this is shown by scholars like Schifrin and and Sirot and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=796.8199999999999s)]
*  others, it was the promises that Genscher and and Baker made to Gorbachev that it was [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=802.62s)]
*  based on those promises that he decided to allow reunification. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=810.3s)]
*  It was and Mary Elise Sarrat proves this better than anyone in her book, not one inch. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=815.42s)]
*  As soon as he said, well, of course, I guess that's up to you. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=821.02s)]
*  They pounced. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=824.64s)]
*  Didn't matter that it wasn't in a treaty. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=825.64s)]
*  It was just his spoken word that said, OK, I guess we'll allow reunification. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=827.9s)]
*  They went for it and it was based on these solemn vows that we will not take advantage. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=831.7800000000001s)]
*  And again, they lied and they said repeatedly that they're going to turn NATO into a political [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=838.38s)]
*  organization, sort of like the EU plus America. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=844.5400000000001s)]
*  But we're going to replace it as a military institution with the CSCE and later the Partnership [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=847.76s)]
*  for Peace. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=854.94s)]
*  And that was to deceive under Bush and under Bill Clinton. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=855.98s)]
*  They said that to the Russians to get them to acquiesce when they knew all along the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=860.42s)]
*  plan was to expand the military alliance right up to their border. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=865.38s)]
*  That's the real history of what happened there, sir. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=869.18s)]
*  OK, boys, we spent 10 minutes on this first question. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=872.42s)]
*  But on the other hand, the first question is a tremendously important one. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=876.0s)]
*  Conversations took place at a minimum. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=881.3s)]
*  Scott, Scott has laid this out. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=883.26s)]
*  Neil has readily grants the conversation between James Baker and Gorbachev saying not one inch [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=885.9399999999999s)]
*  eastward. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=892.26s)]
*  So, Neil, if the United States, there are two questions, honestly. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=893.26s)]
*  Scott, if we were lying, why were we lying? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=898.8599999999999s)]
*  Why were we acting in other than our interests? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=901.2199999999999s)]
*  What motive do you ascribe? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=903.14s)]
*  But you get to that second. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=904.38s)]
*  First, I want to come to Neil. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=905.38s)]
*  Neil, did we intentionally mislead or even inadvertently mislead Gorbachev and then Yeltsin? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=907.06s)]
*  Well, there was a succession of conversations. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=915.74s)]
*  No commitment was ever made not to expand NATO. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=920.58s)]
*  And indeed, when the issue came up during Boris Yeltsin's presidency, President Clinton [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=926.58s)]
*  explicitly said that the inclusion of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the Baltic former Soviet [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=936.1800000000001s)]
*  republics, would be something that Russia would be compensated for with membership of [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=943.86s)]
*  Western institutions, including the Group of Seven. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=953.86s)]
*  So there was nothing mendacious or secretive about what was being discussed. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=957.5s)]
*  Russia was this was in the mid 1990s. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=963.26s)]
*  And in that conversation, as in all the conversations that are relevant here, which, as you say, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=967.54s)]
*  Mary Sorotti describes in her book, while there was a debate within Washington and a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=972.82s)]
*  debate within Europe about the wisdom of including the East European countries in NATO, there [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=978.0200000000001s)]
*  was never any commitment, any binding commitment on the part of the United States not to do [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=986.22s)]
*  it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=992.46s)]
*  And I think in a sense, this is all somewhat beside the point, because ultimately, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=993.46s)]
*  NATO enlargement as it unfolded was not strongly resisted by Russia until the issues of Georgia [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1002.78s)]
*  and Ukraine arose, which is much later at the 2008 NATO conference in Bucharest. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1015.3s)]
*  So we kind of don't want to waste too much time on the parts of NATO enlargement that [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1023.42s)]
*  Russians didn't seriously contest, because those enlargements were not the cause or origin [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1028.9399999999998s)]
*  of the war. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1037.6599999999999s)]
*  Even in Russian propaganda, we're not dealing with the war in Eastern Europe now, because [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1039.1999999999998s)]
*  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia joined NATO. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1044.02s)]
*  The reason that there's a war in Eastern Europe now is that the Russians claim that the inclusion [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1049.06s)]
*  of Ukraine in NATO was a casus belli. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1056.1s)]
*  So Neil, let me put a similar question, but different. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1059.76s)]
*  Since the war in Ukraine began, these are the latest statistics I was able to find scouring [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1065.1999999999998s)]

*  And according to a spokesman for our for the American Defense Department, quote, Russian [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1076.04s)]
*  first year of the war exceeded the total of all Soviet losses since the since the Second [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1082.24s)]
*  World War combined. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1088.2s)]
*  What was Putin? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1091.44s)]
*  What is Putin thinking? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1092.8s)]
*  Make his motives make this action comprehensible to us. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1096.96s)]
*  What does he think he's doing? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1100.14s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's simply not the case that all of these Russian soldiers lost their [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1103.84s)]
*  lives to say nothing of the many Ukrainians the Russians have killed. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1111.6s)]
*  We don't know exactly how many, but it's certainly in the tens and possibly hundreds of thousands [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1116.84s)]
*  did not die because of NATO enlargement. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1122.6599999999999s)]
*  Let's be clear about that, because that's a red herring. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1125.84s)]
*  And it's, I think, an integral part of Russian propaganda. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1128.92s)]
*  We should be skeptical of that argument. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1134.4s)]
*  The reasons, if you'll let me finish. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1137.5600000000002s)]

*  Whatever. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1166.52s)]
*  I'll come back. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1167.52s)]
*  I was going to say it's propaganda. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1168.52s)]
*  We're on Ukraine. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1171.52s)]
*  And Neil's talking. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1175.72s)]
*  Go ahead, Neil. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1176.72s)]
*  If you could let me try to answer the question that Peter put. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1177.72s)]
*  Putin regarded Ukraine. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1182.04s)]
*  Faster. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1183.72s)]
*  You're wasting time. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1184.72s)]
*  Perhaps you could learn some manners, Scott, and we could get further. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1186.52s)]
*  Putin regarded a democratic, independent Ukraine, and Ukraine had been recognized as an independent [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1191.92s)]
*  state since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 as a major threat to his regime. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1196.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1202.92s)]
*  Because a Ukraine as successful as Poland would be an advertisement that there was an [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1204.04s)]
*  alternative way to the way that he intended to lead Russia, the Russian Federation, after [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1209.04s)]
*  he came to power. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1216.28s)]
*  And there was a military dimension to the threat, too. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1219.0s)]
*  In 2014, Putin snuffed out a nationalist uprising against a corrupt president in Ukraine, annexed [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1223.04s)]
*  Crimea, and created many puppet states in the Donbass. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1233.48s)]
*  The problem with this operation was that it created an unsustainable position from a Russian [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1238.6s)]
*  perspective. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1243.36s)]
*  Crimea wasn't secure. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1244.7199999999998s)]
*  There were no good communications to Crimea. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1245.7199999999998s)]
*  It was subject to blockade by the Ukrainians. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1248.12s)]
*  And crucially, despite the weakness of the Western response to Putin's violation of Ukraine's [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1250.48s)]
*  sovereignty, Ukraine's response in the subsequent 10 years was a rapid rearmament and improvement [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1256.0s)]
*  of its own military capabilities. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1264.56s)]
*  By the end of 2020, it was clear that Ukraine was soon going to be able to pose a decisive [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1267.36s)]
*  military threat to the puppet states in Donbass, and potentially also a threat to Russia's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1273.8s)]
*  Black Sea fleet and Russia itself. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  And so, not only for political reasons, but also for military reasons, Putin came to the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1282.6s)]
*  conclusion that he had to act. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1287.9599999999998s)]
*  In order to prepare the ground for his aggression, he published an article on the historic unity [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1291.08s)]
*  of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples, a farraga of lies and misrepresentations designed to [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1297.1999999999998s)]
*  legitimize the annexation. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1303.3999999999999s)]
*  Western policymakers failed to understand how serious Putin was, and did nothing to [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1306.6s)]
*  deter him. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1311.28s)]
*  Indeed, the arm shipments to Ukraine were reduced in 2021, sanctions were taken off [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1312.28s)]
*  the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and every signal was sent from Washington that Putin did not [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1316.2399999999998s)]
*  need to fear a military response if he took further aggressive action in Ukraine. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1323.96s)]
*  He did. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1328.32s)]
*  He thought it would be easy. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1329.2s)]
*  In February of 2022, he attempted a swift blitzkrieg-like operation that was designed [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1331.52s)]
*  to decapitate the Ukrainian state, overthrow Zelensky, and install the kind of pro-Russian [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1338.68s)]
*  government that had existed prior to 2014. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1344.16s)]
*  And it failed. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1348.48s)]
*  It failed completely. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1350.0s)]
*  And it failed because the Ukrainian military really had improved sufficiently to repel [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1351.8s)]
*  this Russian aggression. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1357.8799999999999s)]
*  They defeated the Russians in the Battle of Kiev, drove them back, and indeed by the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1359.72s)]
*  fall of 2022 had Russian armies in full flight from outside Kharkiv and Kherson. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  And that is what happened. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1370.3999999999999s)]
*  Scott, so the notion here is not that we... the invasion of Ukraine took place not because [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1372.1599999999999s)]
*  we, the West, broadly speaking, or the United States, provoked them, the Russians, but because [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1378.96s)]
*  we failed to deter them. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1385.64s)]
*  We indicated too much softness, not too much hardness. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1388.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they say. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1390.96s)]
*  And look, some of what he says is right, but it's a massive pile of lies by omission mostly. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1392.66s)]
*  Starting with anybody who says the truth about this or adds the additional context about [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1398.8s)]
*  this, from anything but London and Washington's point of view is repeating the propaganda [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1403.84s)]
*  of the other side. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1409.08s)]
*  That's what they try to say about Syria, and that's what they try to say about Libya, and [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1410.44s)]
*  that's what they try to say about Iraq, and that's what they try to say about Afghanistan. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1414.04s)]
*  They're just repeating the propaganda of the enemy. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1417.72s)]
*  And yet the dissidents were right about all of those, and the people who were repeating [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1420.5s)]
*  the point of view of Washington and London have done nothing but create disaster after [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1424.28s)]
*  disaster after disaster. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1428.04s)]
*  So I'm not going to sit here and stand for Russia propaganda. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  I got accusations of that. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1432.36s)]
*  I got 7,800 citations in my book. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1434.08s)]
*  Scott, Neil and I are not accusing you of repeating any propaganda. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1437.28s)]
*  Pardon me. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1439.8799999999999s)]
*  We're asking what you think. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  Pardon me. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1441.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm granting that your book is a meticulous piece of work. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1442.8799999999999s)]
*  So go ahead. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1445.56s)]
*  The only citations of Russians talking in there is either Russian media exposing something [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1447.68s)]
*  about the Russian state or just directly conveying their statements because I'm saying here's [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1454.28s)]
*  what they said, not because I'm saying here's how you know it's true because they said it. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1459.14s)]
*  I'm saying here's an example of a claim that they made. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1464.46s)]
*  Why did Putin go in when he did? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1468.42s)]
*  There's no Russian propaganda in any of my arguments. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1472.0200000000002s)]
*  As he said, I'm not accusing you of that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1475.68s)]
*  I'm asking you why did Putin go in when he did? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1478.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I know, but I'm refuting his false accusation that the other side of the story is somehow [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1482.14s)]
*  falling for the lies or repeating the lies of the Russians when it has nothing to do [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1487.5s)]
*  with our conversation here. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1492.62s)]
*  Now that I'm done refuting that, I want to go back to your previous question about why [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1494.1s)]
*  they lied in the 1990s. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1497.54s)]
*  In 1990, it was because the Soviet Union still existed and they still had troops in Eastern [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1499.86s)]
*  Europe. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1504.9s)]
*  The USSR did not finally fall until Christmas 1991. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1505.9s)]
*  And so of course they had to tell the Russians what they needed to hear to get them out of [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1509.34s)]
*  the way, to get them to acquiesce. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1513.34s)]
*  And they continued to lie. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1515.44s)]
*  One of the greatest examples of this, you can read at Brookings by James Goldgeier, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1517.0s)]
*  wrote all about this, was Warren Christopher in 1993 went to Moscow and lied right to Yeltsin's [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1521.0800000000002s)]
*  face, told him again, we're going to do, this is when they replaced the CSCE with the Partnership [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1527.64s)]
*  for Peace. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1532.68s)]
*  And so we're going to do the Partnership for Peace and you and Ukraine will be equal partners [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1533.68s)]
*  in it. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1537.38s)]
*  So in other words, Ukraine's neutrality will be guaranteed. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1538.38s)]
*  There won't be a fight over Ukraine and we'll all be partners together. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1541.06s)]
*  And Yeltsin said this is the greatest stroke of brilliance. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1544.06s)]
*  Tell Bill I'm so enthused, etc., etc. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1546.7s)]
*  And then he come to find out in the beginning of 94 that Clinton announced that, psych, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1549.06s)]
*  we didn't mean that, we're actually going to expand NATO at your expense anyway. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1553.82s)]
*  And yes, they did grouse and complain all through the 1990s, including, you notice he [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1557.3799999999999s)]
*  just skipped 1999 when they brought, when they did the first round and brought the first [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1562.7s)]
*  three nations into NATO. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1567.28s)]
*  They launched the aggressive war against Serbia the same week or two weeks later and proving [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1568.74s)]

*  And the Russians went completely crazy. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1575.72s)]
*  And all of America's best friends in the Russian establishment, people like Chubais [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1577.9199999999998s)]
*  and Gaidar and all those who'd been friends with Clinton and Gore, they said this is the [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1583.52s)]
*  worst thing that you could do. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1589.2s)]
*  You're destroying the entire new warm relationship that we created. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1591.08s)]
*  We have no reason to do this. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1595.28s)]
*  And he cited George Kennan. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1596.9199999999998s)]
*  But let me add here, pardon me, I'm trying to talk fast for you, but listen, let me read [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1598.44s)]
*  George Kennan. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1602.2s)]
*  Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1602.96s)]
*  Let me finish it real quick. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1604.1599999999999s)]
*  Two thirds, sir, two thirds, super majority of the population of the Council on Foreign [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1606.04s)]
*  Relations was against NATO expansion. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1611.2s)]
*  OK, the entire population of the American embassy in Moscow was against it. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1614.36s)]
*  The experts were against it. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1619.32s)]
*  The very few powerful wonks and politically connected interests in the Clinton government [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1621.44s)]
*  overrode them and decided to do it anyway. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1626.72s)]
*  George Kennan and Pat Buchanan. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1629.28s)]
*  It was many, many, including Paul Netza and Robert McNamara and William Perry, the sitting [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1631.1599999999999s)]
*  secretary of defense at the time, said that they should not do this. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1636.3999999999999s)]
*  And for one reason, because it'll unnecessarily provoke the Russians. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1639.4399999999998s)]
*  They said the same thing in 2004 with the second round. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1643.56s)]
*  Why did they do it? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1646.08s)]
*  In other words, if the argument was clear that it was against our own interest to expand [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1648.96s)]
*  NATO, what was the motive? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1652.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's public choice theory, right? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1654.48s)]
*  It's some interests are satisfied. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1656.12s)]
*  So one of the things that was a very big two, two of the things that were extremely important. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1658.6000000000001s)]
*  And this is all from the New York Times. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1663.2s)]
*  This isn't conspiracy theory stuff. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1664.52s)]
*  OK, this is pure just journalism out there. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1666.48s)]
*  You can find it. I have all the footnotes. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1669.04s)]
*  It was the major incentives pushing for it. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1671.16s)]
*  We're lucky dollars in Polish votes and the Republicans were attacking the Democrats [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1674.64s)]
*  for being weak on it. And they said, we're going to corner the Republicans on this issue [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1680.76s)]
*  in Illinois and Pennsylvania, where there are a lot of Eastern European Americans whose [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1685.24s)]
*  votes they wanted to get. And Bruce Jackson from Lockheed launched the committee to expand [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1690.6000000000001s)]
*  NATO and spent millions of dollars lobbying and whining and dining policymakers and [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1696.0400000000002s)]
*  Eastern European leaders to get everybody all on board to build the consensus for this [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1701.48s)]
*  thing, because simply his job was getting rid of fighter jets at American taxpayer [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1705.72s)]
*  expense. And again, there are books about this. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1710.0s)]
*  There's a great article by Richard Cummings about it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1712.24s)]
*  And you can read about it in The New York Times. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1713.88s)]
*  Bruce Jackson Lockheed, NATO expansion. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1715.72s)]
*  It's in The New York Times. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1718.5600000000002s)]
*  This is what the incentives were. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1720.0400000000002s)]
*  It's called public choice theory. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1721.6000000000001s)]
*  It means there's no national interest. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1722.88s)]
*  There's just the individual interests of the men in charge. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1725.0s)]
*  And in this case, we're talking about William Jefferson Clinton and his men. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1727.92s)]
*  And they were terrible men and they made terrible decisions. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1731.64s)]
*  Now, we had to skip. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1734.1200000000001s)]
*  And I know it's a long, complicated subject, but we skipped all the way to 22 and the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1735.48s)]
*  current war, but just barely touching on 2014. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1739.3999999999999s)]
*  And of course, skipping completely omitting the fact that America for the second time [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1743.6s)]
*  in 10 years spent tens or maybe even hundreds of millions of dollars supporting a [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1749.6799999999998s)]
*  phony revolution against the elected government in Ukraine in the Orange Revolution. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1755.08s)]
*  Take a moment to explain what you mean, Scott. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1760.08s)]
*  For our listeners, what took place in 2014, the revolution or the coup according to [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1761.6399999999999s)]
*  some revolution, according to others. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1767.32s)]
*  Take a moment to explain that, would you please? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1768.56s)]
*  Well, it was essentially a street push. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1770.48s)]
*  It wasn't exactly a coup like the general overthrew him and replaced him. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1772.48s)]
*  But it was a right wing push in the street led by the descendants of those who served [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1775.52s)]
*  Hitler in the war in the OUN in World War Two. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  The direct descendants. I demonstrate this. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1784.56s)]
*  Don't shake your head. I demonstrate this with absolute hard facts and the best [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1786.56s)]
*  Holocaust historians. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1790.48s)]
*  Who was overthrown and by whom was he replaced? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1791.48s)]
*  That's exactly who they were. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1794.36s)]
*  Was the right sector and this Favoto party are the direct descendants of those who [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1795.92s)]
*  served the SS in the Second World War. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1800.2s)]
*  And they were the ones who led the push on American dollars to force. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1802.84s)]
*  And by the way, let me say this, I think is so important. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1807.36s)]
*  People said that Paul Manafort was Russians, Russia's agent controlling Trump or [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1810.24s)]
*  and before that, that he was Russia's agent working with Yanukovych. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1816.04s)]
*  But he was in fact representing America's interests because Yanukovych was not so [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1820.52s)]
*  pro-Russian. Yanukovych wanted to sign the association agreement with the [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1825.64s)]
*  European Union and Manafort's entire job working for him was trying to help him [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1830.64s)]
*  accomplish that. There's an excellent interview of Manafort who I would disagree [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1835.5200000000002s)]
*  with about this stuff. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1839.48s)]
*  You can watch this great interview with him with Patrick Bette David where he [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1840.48s)]
*  explains all this and what happened was and even Henry Kissinger, who you're [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1844.1200000000001s)]

*  It's in The Guardian. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1849.5600000000002s)]
*  Henry Kissinger said it was all Angela Merkel's fault because she played two [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  hard of hardball. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1855.76s)]
*  She wasn't willing to give easy enough loan terms. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1857.1599999999999s)]
*  She was demanding too much austerity. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1860.08s)]
*  And she, according to Henry Kissinger, was the one who ruined the deal. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1862.0s)]
*  And once she ruined the deal... [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1866.52s)]
*  The argument is that in 2014, a pro-Russian leader of Ukraine was overthrown by [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1867.52s)]
*  right-wing interests in Ukraine, cooperating with the United States funding and [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1874.36s)]
*  cooperating with right-wing interests in Ukraine. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1879.0s)]
*  They overthrow a more or less pro-Russian leader of Ukraine and replace him with a [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1881.48s)]
*  pro-Western leader of Ukraine. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1885.72s)]
*  That's the argument about 2014. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1887.52s)]
*  Well, that's what I'm saying. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1889.8799999999999s)]
*  This is what happened in the end of 2013 that got it kicked off, was he refused to [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1890.6s)]
*  sign this deal. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1894.8s)]
*  I stated that correctly. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1895.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1897.2s)]

*  Let me add one sentence the way you sum that up, OK, which is after the push was [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1905.04s)]
*  successful, all former Ukrainian presidents signed a letter. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1909.3999999999999s)]
*  Kravchuk, Kuchma and Yushchenko all signed a letter saying we must now just [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1914.44s)]
*  repeal the Harkiv Pact and kick Russia out of the Sevastopol naval base in on the [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1919.3600000000001s)]
*  Crimean Peninsula. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1925.28s)]
*  Only then did Russia, did Putin order his sailors and Marines to seize that [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1926.64s)]
*  peninsula in the Kudai Mane. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1931.64s)]
*  Neil, by the way, boys, I'm going to insist on coming to the present next. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1934.4s)]

*  Neil, go ahead. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1942.4s)]
*  Part of the problem with Scott Horton's argument is that the counterfactual [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1943.84s)]
*  acts plausibility. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1949.4s)]
*  Are you arguing that it would have been better for the countries of Central and [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1951.28s)]
*  Eastern Europe that they didn't join NATO in the period of NATO enlargement? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1956.08s)]
*  Would they have been more secure outside NATO? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1961.52s)]
*  The striking thing about Ukraine's fate is precisely that it happened when it was [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1965.16s)]
*  outside NATO. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1969.04s)]
*  It was the fact that it wasn't protected by Article 5 that left it vulnerable to [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1970.08s)]
*  Russian aggression. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1974.32s)]
*  So one obvious lesson of NATO enlargement is that it certainly benefited those [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1975.68s)]
*  countries that were fortunate enough to become NATO members. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1980.08s)]

*  NATO membership, a path to NATO membership after 2008, but that was never [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1994.84s)]
*  sincerely intended, leaving Ukraine and Georgia in a kind of limbo with some [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=1999.28s)]
*  possibility notionally of NATO membership, but no likelihood of it's happening. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2004.8s)]
*  And of course, both countries subsequently were the victims of Russian [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2008.72s)]
*  military aggression. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2012.36s)]
*  So the first and obvious point is that if you're not in NATO, you're far more [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2013.68s)]
*  likely to be the subject of Russian military aggression than if you are in [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2018.08s)]
*  NATO QED. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2022.0s)]
*  It was eminently sensible for the Czechs, for the Poles, for the Baltic states to [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2023.84s)]
*  join NATO. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2027.8799999999999s)]
*  And the counterfactual of a US policy that wouldn't have brought them into NATO [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2028.96s)]
*  is obviously a much less stable central and Eastern Europe. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2033.2s)]
*  Secondly, to hear Scott Horton defend the Yanukovych regime, one of the most [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2036.5200000000002s)]
*  corrupt regimes to have emerged since the collapse of communism- [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2041.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't defend the regime at all. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2044.0800000000002s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2045.92s)]
*  Well, you argued, if I can finish, you argued that a Nazi revolution or putsch [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2047.2s)]
*  occurred against Yanukovych, but Yanukovych was overthrown in a popular [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2056.64s)]
*  revolution against his egregiously corrupt rule. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2061.7599999999998s)]
*  I wonder, Scott, have you ever been to Ukraine? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2066.0s)]
*  No. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2069.16s)]
*  You see, it seems to me that that's one of the reasons that you are not really a [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2070.92s)]
*  terribly dependable authority on this subject. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2074.7999999999997s)]
*  Give me a break, man. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2077.3199999999997s)]
*  Listen, what that was, that was a popular revolution by some Ukrainians against [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2079.92s)]
*  the interests of many others. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2084.6s)]
*  Give me a break, dude. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2086.64s)]
*  Have you been to Russia? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2088.4s)]
*  You know what? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2091.16s)]
*  These are all red herring arguments. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2092.0s)]
*  You'd want to bring it back. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2093.56s)]
*  No, I kind of think they're red herring. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2094.36s)]
*  There's a counterfactual for you. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2095.36s)]
*  The difference between us, Scott, is the kind of what I'm talking about. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2096.68s)]
*  Is Connolly's rice bowl at Hoover where you guys work? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2100.44s)]
*  I've spoken with the people who were directly involved in Euromaidan and the [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2105.4s)]
*  revolution that overthrew Yanukovych. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2110.7999999999997s)]
*  And I can assure you that they are not Nazis. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2113.4s)]
*  Did you interview Dmitry Yurash? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2116.0s)]
*  And the claim that they are Nazis, Scott, is of course another part of Russian [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2118.12s)]
*  propaganda that you see on recycling in this conversation. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2123.2s)]
*  So I'm sorry, somebody who's been to neither Ukraine nor Russia is not in a [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2128.16s)]
*  terribly strong position, no matter how many copies of the New York Times they've read. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2132.96s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2136.68s)]
*  That's nothing but a red herring argument, as are all your arguments. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2137.84s)]
*  I didn't defend Yanukovych about corruption. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2140.4s)]
*  I think that wasn't addressed. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  What I said was he wanted to move to the West. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2144.3599999999997s)]
*  He was not Russia's puppet. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2148.08s)]
*  He that doesn't mean he was a good man. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2150.64s)]
*  He hired Manafort to help him move West. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2152.7599999999998s)]
*  But the West botched the negotiations. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2156.08s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2159.04s)]
*  No one but you heard me defend Yanukovych in that funny. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2160.12s)]
*  Also, here's for a counterfactual. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2165.04s)]
*  Our current CIA director was the ambassador to Moscow in 2008 when he explicitly [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2167.4399999999996s)]
*  warned Condoleezza Rice not to give a membership action plan to Ukraine and [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2176.4399999999996s)]
*  Georgia. And anyone can read it at WikiLeaks. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2182.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a famous memo. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2185.16s)]
*  It's called yet means yet. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2186.4399999999996s)]
*  And it's by William Burns. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2189.04s)]
*  And he's saying to her, this is the brightest of red lines. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2190.72s)]
*  The Russians, everyone in Russia is agreed, he says. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2194.04s)]
*  He's not just talking to Lavrov. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2197.3199999999997s)]
*  He's talking to everybody at all the think tanks and all the experts. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2198.6s)]
*  And they're all saying this is going to cause a war. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2202.3199999999997s)]
*  Lavrov said, if you bring Ukraine into NATO, it could cause a civil war. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2204.9199999999996s)]
*  This is our current CIA director who failed to prevent this. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2209.52s)]
*  Said, said the Russians said, if you do this, it could cause a civil war in Ukraine. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2213.3599999999997s)]
*  And which would be a situation that they would be forced to make a choice whether [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2219.04s)]
*  to intervene or not. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2222.7599999999998s)]
*  They do not want that. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2224.0s)]
*  Civil war that happened in Ukraine was an invasion by a neighboring country, which [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2225.04s)]
*  is a slightly different thing. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2231.3599999999997s)]
*  She ignored his advice and she gave a membership action plan or a half ass one [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2233.12s)]
*  because the Germans and French did everything they could to try to stop her [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2238.7599999999998s)]
*  and Bush. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2242.64s)]
*  So they compromised and gave this halfway offer, as you said. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2243.72s)]
*  But it's such a circular argument, question begging argument to say that, oh, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2247.3999999999996s)]
*  if only we just brought Ukraine into NATO first and we would have just not had a [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2251.48s)]
*  problem. No, Russia just would have invaded them then because I'm telling you, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2255.52s)]
*  and this is in the book, I cite this, I got I got more footnotes than you've ever [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2258.92s)]
*  seen in your life and direct quotations from American experts from the 1990s [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2263.32s)]
*  through the 2000s, through the 2000 teens and into the 1920s, including your [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2268.6s)]
*  beloved Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski and all of the very top graybeards saying [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2273.84s)]
*  that and including Ken Pollock, who helped you live in a war with Iraq back 20 [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2279.3199999999997s)]
*  years ago. They all said Ukraine itself is the absolute touchiest of issues. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2284.12s)]
*  The most neuralgic issue is what Burns said, because there is a massive ethnic [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2290.6s)]
*  Russian population in the East. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2296.3599999999997s)]
*  It used to belong to Russia in a way that Latvia and Estonia never truly did. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2298.48s)]
*  They were like occupied imperial possessions, but they are a separate ethnicity [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2303.24s)]
*  and and have a different history. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2308.0s)]
*  Whereas Novo Russia is so tied to Russian history, it's an extremely touchy [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2309.76s)]
*  subject and it has been since independence. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2315.96s)]
*  And they all recognize that and they all weren't against it. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2318.72s)]
*  And at various times, Kissinger, Brzezinski, Ken Pollock and all these other [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2321.56s)]
*  Council on Foreign Relations guys said we ought to make a separate deal regarding [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2326.64s)]
*  Ukraine. We ought to promise never to bring them into NATO. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2331.08s)]
*  We ought to guarantee their permanent neutrality. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2334.12s)]
*  Kissinger wrote this in The Washington Post in 2014 and that will avoid picking [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2336.68s)]
*  this fight. Now you say, well, if only we'd given them a war guarantee earlier, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2342.24s)]
*  there never would have been a fight. But that's not true. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2346.04s)]
*  There just would have been a full scale war earlier because the Russians were [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2347.84s)]
*  never going to accept that. That's the fact. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2350.72s)]
*  Well, the reality, of course, Scott, is that the Russians were in no way able to [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2353.64s)]
*  go to war with NATO and they've consistently avoided going to war with NATO [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2357.4s)]
*  for a very good reason. They're entirely outmanned and outgunned by NATO, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2362.0s)]
*  but they could go to war with Ukraine. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2367.28s)]
*  Now, let's grant that there was a meaningful debate about whether or not Ukraine [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2369.56s)]
*  should be offered NATO membership. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2374.44s)]
*  The same argument was made about Georgia. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2377.28s)]
*  And that debate went on within US policy circles before, during and after 2008. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2380.44s)]
*  And as you rightly say, Henry Kissinger was one of those who was skeptical about the [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2385.88s)]
*  idea of making Ukraine a NATO member, though he later changed his mind about that. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2389.88s)]
*  And the reason he changed his mind was, of course, that Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2395.8s)]
*  Now, I don't think anything that you've said so far has persuaded me or I suspect [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2400.1600000000003s)]
*  anybody listening that Russia was right and justified in launching a war. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2405.52s)]
*  That's not my argument. So, well, it does sound a little bit like it because [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2411.2400000000002s)]
*  No, that's ridiculous. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2416.04s)]
*  Again, you've done nothing but tilt at windmills this whole time. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2417.2400000000002s)]
*  You make up counterfactuals that I never said. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2420.2s)]
*  You make up quotes I never said. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2422.44s)]
*  You call me Russian propaganda. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2424.12s)]
*  You've actually argued with something I said or go home and take a nap. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2425.88s)]
*  So the question I'm asking you is, even granting that there were good arguments [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2431.88s)]
*  against Ukraine becoming a member of NATO. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2437.04s)]
*  It's kind of an uptalking. You sound like a little girl. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2439.28s)]
*  You have to go up in your reflection at the end of every sentence like that. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2441.56s)]
*  Let him ask a question. Go ahead. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2445.12s)]
*  I'm showing as much patience as I can with a rather juvenile debater. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2449.2s)]
*  If you grow all of this, it doesn't make Russia's invasion of Ukraine [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2456.2400000000002s)]
*  legitimate any more than, say, Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was legitimate. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2460.7200000000003s)]
*  Unless you unless you're going to argue that this was a justified invasion. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2465.04s)]
*  What exactly is your position? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2470.64s)]
*  Were we wrong to resist it? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2472.6s)]
*  Were we wrong to support Ukraine in defending itself against invasion? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2474.56s)]
*  What's what's your position on that? I don't understand. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2478.2s)]
*  Well, you know, you wrote this article in Bloomberg News. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2481.32s)]
*  Putin and Biden misunderstand history in the Ukraine war that came out in March of 2022. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2483.7599999999998s)]
*  We said you quoted David Sanger from the New York Times, and you also cited [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2489.44s)]
*  all your own sources. And I'm paraphrasing here. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2492.64s)]
*  Anyone who's anyone in Washington and London knows that the goal here [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2496.0s)]
*  is to lock Russia into a long term engagement in Ukraine [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2500.68s)]
*  at the expense of the people of Ukraine's lives in order to weaken Russia. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2505.4s)]
*  That's your great article. We've all cited it so many times. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2510.52s)]
*  You wrote in here that prolonging the war runs the risk of not just leaving [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2513.96s)]
*  tens of thousands of Ukrainians dead and millions homeless, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2517.2799999999997s)]
*  but also of handing Putin something that he can plausibly present at home as victory. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2520.7599999999998s)]
*  Betting on a Russian revolution, which is what they were saying. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2524.72s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to win this war and it's going to weaken Russia [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2527.68s)]
*  and his government's going to fall. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2530.04s)]
*  And you said betting on a Russian revolution is betting on an exceedingly rare event. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2531.6s)]
*  Even if the war continues to go badly for Putin, if the war turns in his favor, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2536.16s)]
*  there will be no palace coup. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2540.04s)]
*  And so you were cautioning against extending the war. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2541.64s)]
*  You explained in here, you said this explains why Joe Biden is so quick [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2545.04s)]
*  to level the accusation that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2550.92s)]
*  meaning to preclude the chance of peace negotiations to prevent [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2554.96s)]
*  peace from taking place, isn't that right? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2559.8s)]
*  This doesn't change anything about the question I asked you, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2562.6400000000003s)]
*  which is, do you think we were wrong to support Ukraine in its war of self-defense? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2566.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm just agreeing with you, agreeing with me here that, of course, it was wrong. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2572.2000000000003s)]
*  You're diametrically opposed to me. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2576.2000000000003s)]
*  You just explained that this isn't a war of self-defense. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a war of America bogging down Russia to weaken and break Russia. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2581.2s)]
*  You're the source for it. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2586.56s)]
*  It's got to do with Ukraine. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2588.3199999999997s)]
*  But the point made in that article, which was you say was published [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2591.16s)]
*  early in the war, was that the war should be ended as soon as possible [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2596.9199999999996s)]
*  in the circumstances that were favorable to Ukraine in 2022. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2601.3199999999997s)]
*  But this doesn't alter the question that I'm asking you. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2604.8399999999997s)]
*  Are we wrong to have supported Ukraine in its war for its independence [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2608.76s)]
*  against Russian aggression? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2613.88s)]
*  Well, you're assuming the premise that history begins on the 24th [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2615.48s)]
*  when the Russian tanks roll in. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2619.48s)]
*  And then what should we do then? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2620.88s)]
*  But why do you get to frame it that way? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2622.2000000000003s)]
*  Usually invasions have a date. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2623.6800000000003s)]
*  And we all know the date when the Russians invaded Ukraine. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2625.84s)]
*  Uh-huh. We also all know that they... [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2629.2400000000002s)]
*  Are you arguing that we should simply have let them roll over [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2631.2000000000003s)]
*  and take control of Kiev? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2635.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm arguing that Joe Biden should have engaged in diplomacy [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2637.6s)]
*  throughout the year 2021 and into 2022 instead of the policy [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2640.96s)]
*  that they adopted, which was to warn Russia, you better not, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2646.84s)]
*  but not to engage in any official real diplomacy to try to end the war. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2651.28s)]
*  So he refused to negotiate even the potential of neutrality for Ukraine. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2656.04s)]
*  They have this concept. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2661.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just jargon. It doesn't mean anything. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2662.84s)]
*  It's called the open door. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2664.96s)]
*  And that means that if a country wants to join NATO, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2667.08s)]
*  that's between them and NATO. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2669.88s)]
*  And no other nation's interest can ever, ever, ever be taken into account [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2671.64s)]
*  no matter what. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2676.24s)]
*  And so even though you and I agree with something you said earlier [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2677.3199999999997s)]
*  in the debate, we said they never truly intended to bring Ukraine into NATO. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2679.84s)]
*  But in other words, a real war guarantee. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2683.48s)]
*  But what they did do was arm them up. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2685.88s)]
*  You talked about Ukraine arming up like it happened magically [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2688.16s)]
*  or they did it themselves. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2690.7599999999998s)]
*  It was the Obama and the Trump governments and then the Biden governments [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2691.96s)]
*  that arm them up. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2695.3599999999997s)]
*  And I'm so glad that you brought that up because you're right [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2696.4399999999996s)]
*  that it was not enough to deter Russia. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2700.0s)]
*  And in fact, at the beginning of the war, a great journalist named [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2702.04s)]
*  Zach Dorfman, who wrote this in-depth series about the CIA in Ukraine [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2705.7999999999997s)]
*  for Yahoo News, he quoted CIA officers who were in charge [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2710.7599999999998s)]
*  of importing those weapons from the United States into Ukraine. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2716.2s)]
*  In the I'm not sure about at least Trump, late Trump and into the Biden years. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2719.9199999999996s)]
*  Pardon me. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2724.16s)]
*  But so many Ukraine. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2725.08s)]
*  Wait, wait, just because I stopped to drink a Dr. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2726.08s)]
*  Pepper doesn't mean you get to jump in here. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2728.04s)]
*  I'm going to jump in. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2730.24s)]
*  Scott, the CIA officers told Zach Dorfman that they warned their bosses [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2731.6s)]
*  to warn the politicians that you have miscalibrated [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2737.92s)]
*  by pouring these weapons in you. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2742.48s)]
*  It's not enough to deter Russia, but it is enough to provoke them. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2744.44s)]
*  It's enough to make them feel like it's now or never, which is what you said. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2748.2s)]
*  That was why Russia invaded, because Ukraine was building up [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2753.0s)]
*  and it was now or never. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2755.64s)]
*  But it was America that was building them up and putting them in the situation [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2757.24s)]
*  where it was now or never. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2761.52s)]
*  And that's why you omitted that part of it, is it was for an intervention [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2763.36s)]
*  that made it that way. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2767.04s)]
*  We we spent now three fifths of our time on antecedents on [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2768.12s)]
*  before the war. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2773.16s)]
*  The Russians invaded in February of 2022. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2774.36s)]
*  Since then, the United States has given Ukraine [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2777.68s)]
*  60 billion dollars in military assistance. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2780.84s)]
*  These have to be round numbers, but these are the best I could find. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2783.44s)]
*  And over 100 billion dollars in economic and humanitarian aid. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2786.6800000000003s)]
*  Too much or too little, Scott? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2790.88s)]
*  Well, look, the whole thing should be called off immediately. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2795.28s)]
*  We need to negotiate the high watermark of Ukraine's effort here. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2797.8s)]
*  What's in September of 2022, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2802.04s)]
*  when they had their brilliant faint in Kursk on, they retook half a curse on [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2805.04s)]
*  and they retook essentially all of our key then it has been all downhill [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2809.0s)]
*  from their former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mullen [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2813.36s)]
*  and the current at that time chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Milley. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2816.4s)]
*  Both said, now's the time to negotiate while you're only this far behind. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2819.84s)]
*  The rest of the establishment, the White House and the media, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2825.0s)]
*  they all said, no, no, no, as much as it takes for as long as it takes [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2827.84s)]
*  until Ukraine is restored to 2013 borders, including Crimea and the rest, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2832.32s)]
*  which was always an absolute pipe dream. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2837.72s)]
*  And by pursuing that with the failed escalation of 2023 [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2840.28s)]
*  and the absolute grind of a war that's taken place in the Donbass, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2844.16s)]
*  they've done nothing but lose territory since then. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2848.56s)]
*  And the Americans do nothing but insist that they lower their conscription age [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2851.12s)]
*  and lower the age at which they send new new cat and father [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2855.6s)]
*  cannon fodder into battle to die in a losing war. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2859.32s)]
*  And people can dress this all up as virtue. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2862.12s)]
*  We can't abandon our friends and all these things. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2864.48s)]
*  But that was what they said about Afghanistan for 20 years. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2866.4s)]
*  We're backing this Afghan national government and its army, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2869.04s)]
*  the Tajik and Hazara and Uzbek coalition to keep the posthumed Taliban out. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2871.76s)]
*  But it didn't work. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2878.0s)]
*  And we got hundreds of thousands of people killed and in the end, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2879.1200000000003s)]
*  lost the war anyway. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2881.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's the same thing that we're doing here. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2883.52s)]
*  It's the same thing that happened in Vietnam. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2885.08s)]
*  These attack missiles aren't game changers against Russia. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2887.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2891.04s)]
*  but unless you're willing to actually lower the conscription age to 18 and do [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2893.8799999999997s)]
*  mass conscription and send them all to the front, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2897.9199999999996s)]
*  which they're not willing to do because they're facing a terrible demographic [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2899.9599999999996s)]
*  crisis right now, they're only setting middle aged men to the front to fight. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2903.04s)]
*  They're not willing to risk their young men. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2906.7599999999998s)]
*  And Lindsey Graham demands that no lower the age, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2908.4399999999996s)]
*  send younger and younger men over there to die in a war that they've already lost. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2911.7999999999997s)]
*  The question now, gentlemen, is whether the Russians are going to take Harkiv [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2915.72s)]
*  and Odessa or whether we're going to be able to negotiate a peace [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2919.3999999999996s)]
*  before it gets that bad. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2922.6s)]
*  Neil, this is you in a recent interview. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2924.16s)]
*  I'm quoting you, Neil. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2925.92s)]
*  It's not very easy to see how Ukraine can get Russia out. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2927.36s)]
*  So it's important that we get an armistice. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2932.0s)]
*  And the analogy I would use is with the Korean war. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2934.8399999999997s)]
*  Close quote. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2938.16s)]
*  Neil, could you explain yourself on that one? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2939.2s)]
*  Well, I argued from very early on, in fact, even from the first month [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2941.88s)]
*  of the war, that it might well be understood as the Korean war of our cold war, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2945.6s)]
*  the first hot war really that clarifies the true geopolitical lie of the land. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2951.28s)]
*  We've got this far in the debate without anybody mentioning [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2956.2000000000003s)]
*  that Russia's war effort would not have been sustainable [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2959.76s)]
*  without large scale economic support from China, China, as well as weapons [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2962.36s)]
*  from Iran and now weapons and men from North Korea. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2966.6800000000003s)]
*  So an axis of sorts has formed in support of Russia's war effort. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2970.6800000000003s)]
*  And on the other side, Ukraine has been supported not only by the United States, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2975.88s)]
*  but actually European Union countries have delivered more in financial terms, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2979.2s)]
*  though not in military terms, to Ukraine than the United States. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2984.2s)]
*  So the parallel with the Korean War was that you have a year [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2988.24s)]
*  of very kinetic warfare and then something like attrition and stalemate. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2992.24s)]
*  And that's been to some extent true until really USAID was cut off, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=2998.3999999999996s)]
*  which caused a significant deterioration of Ukraine's position [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3004.68s)]
*  in that six month period. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3008.12s)]
*  Now, Scott, who likes getting hot under the collar, will be surprised. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3009.92s)]
*  Perhaps he stopped reading my columns to realize that we agree [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3013.08s)]
*  that the war's prolongation after 2022 was a major error. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3017.08s)]
*  The Biden administration's made a succession of mistakes. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3021.2s)]
*  The first one was to fail to deter Putin in 2021. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3023.64s)]
*  And the second one was not to end the war in 2022. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3027.6s)]
*  We don't disagree about that. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3030.04s)]
*  The issue really is whether the new Trump administration will be able to end the war [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3031.8399999999997s)]
*  when the balance of military advantage is clearly tilted in favor of Russia. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3036.8s)]
*  It's very hard to get people to negotiate an end to a war if one side is clearly winning. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3041.0s)]
*  And this is the legacy that the Biden administration has left [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3046.52s)]
*  to Donald Trump and his national security team. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3050.52s)]
*  As I go every year to Ukraine and therefore know the country rather better than Scott, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3053.48s)]
*  I can assure you that the mood is extremely bleak in Kiev right now. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3058.48s)]
*  And it has been really for most of this year. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3062.72s)]
*  There's a great deal of bitterness that the Biden administration [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3066.56s)]
*  encouraged the 2023 counteroffensive, but didn't supply the wherewithal for it to succeed. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3070.08s)]
*  Peter, you asked, have we given too little or too much? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3075.72s)]
*  Correct. Ukraine. The answer is very simple. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3079.0s)]
*  Too little for them to win, just enough for them not to lose. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3081.2s)]
*  But now actually not even that much. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3085.76s)]
*  And in a desperate attempt to correct matters, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3088.2s)]
*  restrictions are being lifted on the use of attack arms and storm shadows. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3091.32s)]
*  But it's too late because the potential targets were long ago moved by the Russians out of range. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3094.64s)]
*  So although Scott likes getting angry, actually, we agree on this. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3099.64s)]
*  I think the Biden administration has bungled this and it's succumbed to the delusion [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3104.12s)]
*  that it was in American interest for the war to be prolonged. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3109.2s)]
*  Whereas I think Kissinger understood before his death that as in any case of this sort, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3112.3199999999997s)]
*  when there are very, very unequal competence. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3118.8399999999997s)]
*  And remember, Russia is in economic terms 11 times larger than Ukraine. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3121.72s)]
*  In those circumstances, you've got to get the war over as soon as you can, really. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3126.3599999999997s)]
*  And it should have been ended by negotiation in 2022. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3130.96s)]
*  It's much harder now. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3134.3999999999996s)]
*  So, Neil, back to the North Korean analogy extremely briefly. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3135.72s)]
*  There's an armistice in Korea. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  And all these decades later, South Korea is a rich, democratic country. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3143.2799999999997s)]
*  It has never been able to reunify the country. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3148.7599999999998s)]
*  But if something like that happened in Ukraine, that is to say there were a settlement, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3152.32s)]
*  the Russians under the settlement keep Crimea and about a fifth of Ukraine proper, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3158.08s)]
*  a fifth of non-Crimean Ukraine. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3163.32s)]
*  And two decades from now, three decades from now, we look at Western Ukraine, including Kyiv, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3167.52s)]
*  and say, here's a country that's prosperous, that's democratic. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3173.68s)]
*  That would be a victory, correct? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3179.2000000000003s)]
*  It would be a victory by analogy with the Korean case. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3181.56s)]
*  But the nightmare scenario is that Ukraine ends up being South Vietnam, not South Korea. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3184.76s)]
*  In other words, it's not in a sufficiently strong state at the end of the peace negotiations [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3190.28s)]
*  to survive a second phase or, I suppose, third phase of Russian aggression. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3195.56s)]
*  And that will mean that a lot depends on what kind of security guarantees are provided to Ukraine. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3200.36s)]
*  I think it's highly unlikely that NATO membership will be the way that this is resolved. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3205.8s)]
*  I don't think the Trump administration has many members that think that way. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3211.2s)]
*  But it's still possible for Ukraine to have some of the kind of security guarantees that South Korea had. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3216.56s)]
*  After all, South Korea is not a member of NATO. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3221.28s)]
*  This NATO issue we began with is important. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3223.84s)]
*  Peter, if I may just make one point. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3226.56s)]
*  Scott regards this as a sort of flashpoint and a major reason why war happened. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3229.4s)]
*  Finland, of course, is now a member of NATO, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3234.48s)]
*  one of the unintended consequences of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3237.7200000000003s)]
*  And Finland is in many ways as big a problem from a Russian vantage point as Ukraine. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3241.48s)]
*  Scott, are you expecting Vladimir Putin to attack Finland next, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3246.96s)]
*  now that it's been part of NATO enlargement? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3250.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope not. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3255.12s)]
*  It clearly could be construed as an offensive threat to them. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3256.6s)]
*  And why would it happen? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3261.08s)]
*  Don't you? And the reason is that it's a native. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3262.64s)]
*  I can't hear you when you're trying to talk over me. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3265.52s)]
*  We're going to put more words in my mouth. Go ahead and try. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3267.68s)]
*  My point is just that the reason it won't happen is that Finland is a NATO member. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3270.56s)]
*  And Ukraine's problems, I said before, was that it was never a NATO member. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3275.16s)]
*  And that's what made it vulnerable. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3278.6s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, that's funny. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3280.12s)]
*  Wait, wait a goddamn minute. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3282.08s)]
*  Listen, Russia never invaded Finland this whole time. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3283.76s)]
*  It's just what they would have, but we just brought him into NATO last year. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3287.4s)]
*  We just brought him into NATO last year. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3291.6000000000004s)]
*  And Putin said when America brought Finland in, they asked him, he said, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3292.92s)]
*  listen, we're against this and it does create new strategic problems for us. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3295.96s)]
*  On the other hand, we don't have an ongoing border dispute with Finland. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3300.28s)]
*  We don't have nearly complicated as complicated politics [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3305.0s)]
*  in dealing with Finland as we have in Ukraine. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3309.1200000000003s)]
*  Ukraine is an entirely different issue. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3312.08s)]
*  In Finland, the danger is Western military forces being based there. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3314.8s)]
*  But there's no ongoing crisis as far as, for example, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3319.12s)]
*  millions of ethnic Russians whose liberties are being threatened [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3323.76s)]
*  on the other side of the border, as was the extremely complicated [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3327.88s)]
*  and dangerous situation in Ukraine. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3331.6s)]
*  So just for the record, you're just always begging the question. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3333.84s)]
*  Listen, there was no threat to the rights of ethnic Russians [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3336.48s)]
*  in pre-war Ukraine. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3340.92s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3342.28s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3343.7200000000003s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3345.12s)]
*  And I document the myriad ways in which the Russian language [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3345.96s)]
*  and Russian speakers were being persecuted, their language was being. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3351.08s)]
*  Why did the civilian population of Eastern Ukraine [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3354.44s)]
*  not welcome the Russians then? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3358.44s)]
*  Why did they fight them? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3360.36s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm not following you. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3361.36s)]
*  Well, there's no such thing as the people of Eastern Ukraine. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3364.04s)]
*  There are many people in Eastern Ukraine who absolutely did. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3367.64s)]
*  There are many dead people in Eastern Ukraine, thanks to your friends, the Russians. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3371.3599999999997s)]
*  Keith, my friends, the Russians, you're pathetic. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3374.68s)]
*  Listen, Keith Gesson, my friend from The New York Times, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3377.3199999999997s)]
*  was there and witnessed hundreds of thousands of people vote yes [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3380.44s)]
*  on independence in 2014. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3383.7999999999997s)]
*  And it wasn't because he loves Russia. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3386.16s)]
*  It was because they felt that they were being attacked, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3388.7599999999998s)]
*  militarily attacked by their own, what they thought was their own [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3392.12s)]
*  national government protection force in Kiev. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3395.56s)]
*  And so they were turning to others. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3397.96s)]
*  The staggering thing about this conversation is you're almost total ignorance of Ukraine. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3399.68s)]
*  I'm really wondering why we're bothering having it. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3403.48s)]
*  What's amazing is you don't know anything about what I know about Ukraine. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3405.7599999999998s)]
*  And what's really amazing is that somebody like you [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3409.88s)]
*  Take a trip there Scott. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3412.24s)]
*  Take a trip. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3413.24s)]
*  Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3414.24s)]
*  A British imperialist who said that we need to get seven thousand [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3415.24s)]
*  Americans killed in Iraq for your interest is allowed to show his face in public [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3419.52s)]
*  policy anywhere ever. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3424.96s)]
*  Scott, we're coming to the end. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3426.72s)]
*  We have six. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3428.3199999999997s)]
*  I bodied your wife in front of everybody. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3429.3199999999997s)]
*  We have six minutes left. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3430.92s)]
*  Scott, question to you. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3432.16s)]
*  What kinds of guarantee? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3434.16s)]
*  Donald Trump has said again and again and again that he wants to end the war. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3435.56s)]
*  He even said at one point he would end it even before taking office. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3439.2799999999997s)]
*  It seems clear, although if you want to attack this premise, feel free. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3443.3999999999996s)]
*  It seems clear as I look at it that the United States would have to engage in some [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3447.92s)]
*  offer of military guarantees, economic guarantees to support to make the [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3453.08s)]
*  Ukrainians feel that they could settle with the Russians. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3458.56s)]
*  To what extent should we be willing, should the Trump administration be willing [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3462.6s)]
*  to provide guarantees, economic and military guarantees to Ukraine? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3468.72s)]
*  Scott, no. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3472.7999999999997s)]
*  Or to put it another way, how should Donald Trump settle this? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3474.44s)]
*  Well, Mr. Ferguson was right that the Russians are in a position of strength, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3478.04s)]
*  which is going to make it very difficult for Trump and who has surrounded himself [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3482.04s)]
*  with hawks. Mark Rubio is going to be the secretary of state for crying out loud. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3485.04s)]
*  So I don't know what luck they're going to have trying to resolve this. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3489.08s)]
*  There have been plenty of reasonable proposals put together by very [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3492.52s)]
*  distinguished gentlemen far more credentialed than myself. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3496.16s)]
*  That would say that they would have a permanent guarantee of neutrality in their [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3499.44s)]
*  constitution. They would be allowed EU membership, but not NATO membership. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3502.88s)]
*  And I don't know what security guarantees European countries might be willing to [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3508.08s)]
*  give, but America should not give security guarantees to anyone. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3511.56s)]
*  You know, back 20 years ago in a debate with Robert Kagan at AEI, Mr. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3515.68s)]
*  Ferguson said, well, if the American people can't afford the war in Iraq, we'll [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3519.48s)]
*  just have to cut benefits for Medicaid and Medicare in order so that we can build [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3525.12s)]
*  up our military force. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3530.24s)]
*  And in fact, America is bankrupt and we have a Brit telling us we've got to cut our [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3531.7599999999998s)]
*  welfare programs for our elderly people so that we can afford militarism. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3536.4s)]
*  That war wasted between five and eight trillion dollars. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3540.64s)]
*  Now the national debt is thirty six trillion. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3544.4s)]
*  The interest on the debt is two trillion dollars per year. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3547.0s)]
*  I'm talking to guys from the Hoover Institution. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3550.04s)]
*  Let me lecture you guys a little bit about that. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3552.08s)]
*  I'm asking you a question about what Donald Trump should do. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3554.2400000000002s)]
*  Now, Mr. Ferguson, we can't afford it. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3557.2s)]
*  If you want a world empire, you should get the British. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3560.56s)]
*  I think that's the real colossus, which argues clearly the United States does not [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3562.92s)]
*  is not likely to be able to manage a world empire. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3568.12s)]
*  But my question for you, Mr. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3571.24s)]
*  Horton, is should the United States have provided troops to South Korea? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3573.8799999999997s)]
*  Should it have provided military military presence in post-war Japan? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3578.3599999999997s)]
*  Always trying to contain the Soviet Union during the Cold War. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3583.3599999999997s)]
*  Was that also a mistake? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3587.3999999999996s)]
*  Always truncating the antecedents. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3589.72s)]
*  It was the South that started the Korean War with American help. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3591.48s)]
*  And this is documented. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3595.44s)]
*  I forgot what's his name. The great scholar. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3597.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that Noam Chomsky had changed his name to Scott Horton. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3599.08s)]
*  No, please. You know, people can search at antiwar.com. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3603.32s)]
*  Just Romando has the review of the historian's book. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3606.72s)]
*  I forget his name off the top of my head. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3609.68s)]
*  But it's the great historian of the Korean War who shows how America [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3611.4s)]
*  was supporting South Korean forces. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3614.88s)]
*  Just to be clear, Stalin authorized the invasion of South Korea. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3616.92s)]
*  Jesus, any serious historian of the Cold War will tell you that [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3622.2s)]
*  if you trouble to read their work. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3625.76s)]
*  I'll respond to John Gaddis. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3627.5600000000004s)]
*  Neil, this is you once again in that recent interview I quoted earlier. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3629.32s)]
*  I'm quoting you, Neil. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3632.8s)]
*  If we are to make sure that Putin is not only stopped in Ukraine, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3634.28s)]
*  but stopped altogether, there has to be a real and serious effort [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3637.0s)]
*  by the European members of NATO to get not just to 2 percent of GDP [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3640.2400000000002s)]
*  that's on defense spending, but to three and a half percent, close quote. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3644.76s)]
*  So. An amendment of the question I've just asked, Scott, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3649.44s)]
*  what should the Trump administration be willing to offer, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3654.52s)]
*  so to speak, to get this settled? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3657.88s)]
*  But also, is there not an opening here for the Europeans to step up [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3660.72s)]
*  and provide us a way to shift our attention to China? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3665.72s)]
*  But Scott said earlier that Trump has surrounded himself by hawks. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3669.7999999999997s)]
*  I quote J.D. Vance in 2022, quoting J.D. Vance. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3673.92s)]
*  I got to be honest with you. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3677.6s)]
*  I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3678.7999999999997s)]
*  Neil, what should Trump offer and what should the Europeans do? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3682.56s)]
*  It's worth adding that J.D. Vance in a recent interview with the New York Times [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3686.0s)]
*  changed his position and made the point that it would be quite wrong [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3690.3199999999997s)]
*  if Russia were allowed to take Ukraine. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3694.3599999999997s)]
*  Ukraine must, in fact, not be handed over to Russia. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3697.6s)]
*  So his position has shifted. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3701.3599999999997s)]
*  Clearly, the Europeans are at least a decade away from strategic autonomy. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3703.9599999999996s)]
*  It will take them a very long time to rebuild their eroded defenses [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3708.04s)]
*  and defense industrial complex. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3711.84s)]
*  The ultimate goal, and this is something that President Trump long argued for, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3714.1200000000003s)]
*  but he's not the first president to make the argument, must be for there to be [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3717.92s)]
*  meaningful burden sharing so that the costs of NATO are not disproportionately [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3722.2000000000003s)]
*  shouldered by American taxpayers. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3725.84s)]
*  That's long been my position. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3728.0s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump has already moved Europeans quite some way down that road. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3729.92s)]
*  But it would be wrong. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3734.84s)]
*  Indeed, it would be a delusion to imagine that the Europeans can provide [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3735.88s)]
*  sufficient deterrence in the short run to prevent a third [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3738.92s)]
*  Russian war of aggression against Ukraine at some point in the near future. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3743.1600000000003s)]
*  This isn't going to get settled, Peter, in the sense of there being a full peace [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3747.96s)]
*  agreement. And armistice is, I think, the most likely outcome, a ceasefire. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3752.48s)]
*  And in that ceasefire, I think it's highly likely that Russia will remain [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3758.32s)]
*  in control of somewhat less than 20 percent of Ukrainian territory. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3762.44s)]
*  But I don't think the Ukrainians will be obliged to recognize that [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3766.12s)]
*  as a legitimate annexation, nor should they be, because the international order [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3769.3199999999997s)]
*  has to be based on something other than the kind of right of might [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3772.7999999999997s)]
*  that Scott Holden has in mind. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3777.0s)]
*  We can't let the invasion of Ukraine be acknowledged as legitimate [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3778.68s)]
*  any more than we could let the invasion of Kuwait be recognized as legitimate. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3781.96s)]
*  The United States will therefore have to help Ukraine with its defenses, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3787.16s)]
*  just as it helps Israel and has long helped Israel with its defenses. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3791.3199999999997s)]
*  Otherwise, Ukraine, like Israel, will be menaced by superior [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3795.1200000000003s)]
*  hostile forces. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3800.1200000000003s)]
*  So this is the simple reality. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3801.5600000000004s)]
*  And it's nothing to do with empire. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3802.96s)]
*  My book, Colossus, argued that America was not likely or able to run an empire. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3805.2000000000003s)]
*  But it is the basis of American primacy. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3810.4s)]
*  And we must want American primacy to endure in Europe as well as in Asia. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3813.52s)]
*  The United States has to prioritize. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3818.6000000000004s)]
*  It faces a hostile axis of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3820.84s)]
*  They threaten American interests in multiple locations. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3824.84s)]
*  The new Trump administration will prioritize, I feel sure, China [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3828.04s)]
*  over these other threats, because China is by far the biggest and most dangerous. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3831.6400000000003s)]
*  But he can't walk away from Ukraine, as Scott Holden seems to imply, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3835.92s)]
*  because the complete collapse of Ukraine, victory for Putin's aggression, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3840.6400000000003s)]
*  would be a very, very dark day for European and for global security. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3845.8s)]
*  The question for you, Mr. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3850.92s)]
*  Holden, is who would be next? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3852.36s)]
*  We have quite some experience in European history, if you study it, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3854.16s)]
*  of aggressive authoritarian regimes invading countries. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3857.92s)]
*  And if you do nothing, as we did, of course, in 1938, 39, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3862.52s)]
*  when it was the partition of Czechoslovakia that happened. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3866.16s)]
*  What happens is not surprising. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3869.0s)]
*  They invade somewhere else. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3871.0s)]
*  And sooner or later, you do have the nightmare of World War Three. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3872.3999999999996s)]
*  So deterrence, peace through strength, is crucial to what the Trump [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3875.44s)]
*  administration has to do. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3879.56s)]
*  And that must include deterring Russia from any further aggression against Ukraine. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3880.68s)]
*  All right. Scott, things here. Mr. Robinson. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3885.6s)]
*  I just wanted to say we're pretty much we're nearly out of time. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3888.3199999999997s)]
*  Closing statements, Scott. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3892.08s)]
*  Yes, sir. I'll try to be quick here. First of all, I have one correction. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3893.3599999999997s)]
*  I made an error in the heat of my argument there. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3896.44s)]
*  Mr. Ferguson and his friends got 4000 Americans killed in Iraq, not seven. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3899.64s)]
*  Seven is from Iraq and Afghanistan, which I know he supported as well. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3904.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's funny that you say we should call it primacy, not empire, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3908.68s)]
*  because in July of 2003, in your big debate with Robert Kagan at AEI, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3911.64s)]
*  your entire point was that we should dispense with all the euphemisms [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3916.6s)]
*  like primacy and predominance and hegemony and just go ahead. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3921.4s)]
*  The American people must embrace empire. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3926.2s)]
*  It worked for the British. It was fantastic. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3929.8s)]
*  And I'll be posting that. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3932.28s)]
*  And where you say the American people, they'll just have to take cuts [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3933.68s)]
*  to their elderly pension programs so that we can afford militarism [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3936.2s)]
*  in the Middle East and your giant failed progress in Mesopotamia. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3939.64s)]
*  I'll be posting that on my Twitter feed so everyone can read it. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3942.56s)]
*  Where 2003 you is mocking 2024 you for using euphemisms like primacy. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3945.52s)]
*  And in fact, you even say I read it, re read it this morning. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3951.64s)]
*  Even say there, of course, George Bush shouldn't call it empire. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3953.88s)]
*  When we're addressing the public, we should always use these euphemisms. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3957.24s)]
*  But between you and me, Bob Kagan, we know what we're doing here. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3960.92s)]
*  It's all for the world. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3964.72s)]
*  I'm talking about something that happened 20 years ago. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3965.72s)]
*  Could you give us a closing statement on the present? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3967.32s)]
*  I'm an American. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3969.84s)]
*  I'm an American and I truly resent British people coming over here. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3971.36s)]
*  I'm also an American, Scott. I'm a US citizen. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3975.72s)]
*  Well, nominally, but you represent really you're going to call my question. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3978.2s)]
*  You're going to call my nationality into question and my naturalization into question. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3982.36s)]
*  That's fun. Well, everything out of your mouth is against America's interests. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3986.0s)]
*  So I don't know why anyone would listen to you. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3990.0s)]
*  I don't think it's in America's interest to hand Ukraine to Russia, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3991.8s)]
*  which is what you seem to want to do. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3993.92s)]
*  You thought it was a great idea for America to hand Baghdad over to Ayatollah Sistani, right? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=3995.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, you can look at the Middle East and draw your own conclusions about [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4001.28s)]
*  how American foreign policy works. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4004.56s)]
*  Anyone can see what you did in Iraq. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4006.4s)]
*  You and your buddy, Bob Kagan. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4008.6800000000003s)]
*  The use to talking about Iraq tells me you've lost the debate on Ukraine. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4010.28s)]
*  No, I was just making a correction about how many people you killed there. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4013.84s)]
*  On the question of a closing statement on Ukraine, Scott, because we are out of time. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4017.04s)]
*  It's a rather small number by comparison with the number of Ukrainians Russian [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4022.3199999999997s)]
*  aggression has killed all of the there are 37 million people driven out of their [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4025.68s)]
*  homes by the terror wars, at least four million people killed, according to the [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4031.2s)]
*  cost of war project at Brown University. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4035.04s)]
*  You're absolutely wrong about that. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4037.2s)]
*  Ukraine is still going on in Somalia and all across the Middle East. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4038.9599999999996s)]
*  And anyway, on the question of Ukraine, Mr. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4043.2799999999997s)]
*  Robinson, you and the rest of your audience will notice that the Hawks never [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4046.0s)]
*  have any actual specific details about what they want to see happen. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4049.72s)]
*  They always resort to these slogans about we just can't get in. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4053.3999999999996s)]
*  You want to happen. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4056.64s)]
*  We cannot let Putin win. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4057.9199999999996s)]
*  But I'm asking what's your plan? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4060.2799999999997s)]
*  Because the fact of the matter is to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine would take [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4062.7599999999998s)]
*  American Navy and Marines and army to drive them out. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4068.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't even think the plan is already suggested his plan, which is an armistice [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4073.3599999999997s)]
*  for now. Would that be acceptable to you? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4078.44s)]
*  Well, but he also says they cannot be [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4081.2000000000003s)]
*  allowed to win and they cannot be allowed to take what they've taken. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4083.04s)]
*  So which is it? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4086.4s)]
*  But the armistice doesn't give any formal recognition to the Soviets. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4087.48s)]
*  It simply puts off for possibly decades. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4091.12s)]
*  His analogy was Korea, which is [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4093.2000000000003s)]
*  right. So so what is your plan, Scott? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4095.8s)]
*  Close your closing statement. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4099.4800000000005s)]
*  We are over time now. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4100.96s)]
*  Well, pardon me then for the mistake. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4102.4s)]
*  If you're truly saying that, no, the policy of trying to reverse what's [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4104.12s)]
*  happened in the invasion so far should be abandoned. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4107.5599999999995s)]
*  Then I agree with you about that. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4109.44s)]
*  And if you're you know, as far as what [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4111.04s)]
*  security guarantees America should give to Ukraine after this, it should be none. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4113.16s)]
*  America should read Kiev the facts of life, which are there's nothing more that [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4116.719999999999s)]
*  can be done for you in this situation. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4121.04s)]
*  You guys need to come to peace. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4123.12s)]
*  And by the way, here's one thing America [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4125.0s)]
*  definitely could do for Zelensky and that would be to provide him some Marine Corps [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4127.0s)]
*  bodyguards because he's surrounded. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4131.36s)]
*  And listen, this is important. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4133.959999999999s)]
*  Nazis like Dmitry Yurash and Andrey [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4135.48s)]
*  Perubiy and Andrey Bolesky have threatened to murder Poroshenko and Zelensky [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4139.0s)]
*  repeatedly when they talk about trying to make peace. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4144.12s)]
*  So Zelensky tried to implement the Minsk [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4146.719999999999s)]
*  2 deal in 2019 and they threatened to murder him. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4149.24s)]
*  And gentlemen, we're done. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4152.639999999999s)]
*  And the New York Times said these are credible threats. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4154.24s)]
*  Scott, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4156.88s)]
*  60 seconds ago, I thought I heard a note of partial agreement. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4158.84s)]
*  I'm going to latch onto that to close out this conversation. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87z870sgdYE&t=4162.0s)]
