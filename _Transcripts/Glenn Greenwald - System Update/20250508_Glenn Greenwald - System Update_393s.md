# Should There Be Limits On What Professors Can Say? With Christopher Rufo
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ)
*  Last question. On this question of the use of DEI practices by universities, to me it seems like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  there's a crucial distinction here, which is on the one hand you have very strong objections that, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  as I said before, I find at least plausible if not valid, that when universities are choosing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=21.0s)]
*  who gets into the school and who doesn't based on the applicant's race, that at least it's racism, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=27.4s)]
*  it's immoral, and it may be a violation of Civil Rights Act. You could probably even say that it is. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=36.32s)]
*  And so there are schools that have been doing that. There have been legal challenges. The [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=42.28s)]
*  Supreme Court has ruled that that type of admission practice is illegal as well. And so that's one [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=45.44s)]
*  thing. Are these universities violating federal law in terms of their admission practice, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=53.4s)]
*  which obviously is a legitimate concern for the federal government to have? Then there's DEI as [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=58.32s)]
*  a kind of ideology or belief system that gets taught in classes or where material is included [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=63.76s)]
*  in the curriculum that basically says, just to take a kind of common example that you focused on, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=70.36s)]
*  there's something inherently imperialistic or colonizing or domineering about whiteness and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=76.12s)]
*  white people. A view that I personally find to be, I would say, racist and offensive, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  but which I believe people have the right to express. Just like when Amy Wax goes into class [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=94.48s)]
*  and says, hey, FBI statistics show that black people commit crimes at wildly disproportionate [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=101.44s)]
*  rates in terms of the percentage of the population. A lot of people view that as racist. A lot of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=107.64s)]
*  people view that as just bringing facts or a certain viewpoint, and it should be permitted. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=112.88s)]
*  Is that something that you think the government should be trying to prohibit as well? Not DEI [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=117.0s)]
*  in how it does administrative work like admissions and hiring, but even what is taught by professors [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=122.56s)]
*  in the classroom? I don't define that as DEI, and in fact, I've said this since a speech at [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=131.48s)]
*  Stanford a number of years ago. I think DEI should be really restricted to administrative policy, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=140.36s)]
*  so it should be about administration, admissions, hiring, contracting, funding, and other institutional [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=147.48s)]
*  questions. But those DEI prohibitions should not apply to the actual academic work or classroom [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=154.84s)]
*  speech, et cetera. I think that's a really important distinction. Sometimes some political [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=163.76s)]
*  figures on the right have blurred that. I think that's a mistake. That's been my position [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=170.2s)]
*  consistently. Look, the Civil Rights Act itself is another example of this theme that we've been [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=176.24s)]
*  talking about. Some libertarians say that the Civil Rights Act is an infringement on speech and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=184.56s)]
*  free association, and therefore is incompatible with the Bill of Rights and should be repealed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=190.0s)]
*  I point out, I don't support that. That's not my belief. I also point out that the Civil Rights [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=198.4s)]
*  Act is the most popular piece of legislation in the United States. Even as a practical matter, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=203.56s)]
*  it's not going to get repealed, even if some people argue that it should. The real question [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=210.28s)]
*  before us is, okay, do we have a Civil Rights Act that applies to some groups or to all groups? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  The reason I oppose DEI is the same reason that I oppose the Antisemitism Awareness Act. I don't [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=223.08s)]
*  think that we should be codifying into law group preferences of any kind. We have a complex, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=228.84s)]
*  multiracial country. That's the demographic reality. I think that the only fair way for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=234.76s)]
*  the government and for institutions of higher education to have any moral legitimacy and to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=241.08s)]
*  have any coherence with the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act, you have to have a strict, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=248.2s)]
*  colorblind equality policy. While I'm, of course, sympathetic to entertaining speech, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=254.44s)]
*  I think that there is a restriction already on administration because of the Civil Rights Act. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=264.6s)]
*  That's been the law of the land for many years. My argument is that it should be enforced equally [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=271.32s)]
*  to all groups. DEI is a violation. When it's put into practice administratively, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  it's a clear violation of the law. My ideal, my gold standard, the thing I'm moving towards [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=283.96s)]
*  is simply to say every individual will be judged on his or her accomplishments, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=291.88s)]
*  not on his or her ancestry. I think that's the way to reduce this kind of obsession and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=298.52s)]
*  this animosity and this conflict on race. It will create, on the other side, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=306.12s)]
*  a true representation of accomplishment. That's, I think, what we really want to see. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what I'm fighting for, and I think we can get there. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=320.68s)]
*  All right. Matt, yeah, I think that's a view that has gained more and more support with each passing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=323.0s)]
*  year. I would venture to guess that it's probably the view of a majority of Americans now at first, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=328.2s)]
*  affirmative action and quotas were intended to be temporary, like most temporary things, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=334.36s)]
*  like the Patriot Act, for example, that was temporary. They turned into permanent [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=338.68s)]
*  policies. I think a lot of people have agreed that we've gotten to the point where not only [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=342.68s)]
*  don't we need them anymore, they're actually quite pernicious. All right, Chris, it was good to end [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=347.0s)]
*  on a note of agreement and even on the parts where we disagreed. I really enjoyed our conversation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  I very much appreciate your taking the time to come on and talk about it. It's always great [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=357.24s)]
*  to have you on, and I hope to do so again. All right. Thanks. Appreciate it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_AbL3hEfQ&t=360.44s)]
