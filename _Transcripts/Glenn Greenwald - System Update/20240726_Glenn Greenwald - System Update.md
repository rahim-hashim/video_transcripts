# Cenk Uygur and Michael Tracey Debate Trump's Perceived Threat to Democracy and More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g)
*  Now my next guest, this one is going to be exciting for me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm excited to welcome Cenk Uygur. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=10.72s)]
*  He is the founder of the Young Turks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=15.88s)]
*  I formerly worked for the Young Turks in a previous life. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=19.32s)]
*  I always respected and appreciated the autonomy [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=22.96s)]
*  that I was given within the Young Turks to do my own thing, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  even when it rustled some feathers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=28.32s)]
*  And maybe everyone didn't always agree. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=30.68s)]
*  So Cenk has my admiration for that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=33.2s)]
*  And Cenk actually technically ran for president [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=36.28s)]
*  for the Democratic primary nomination in 2024, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=39.64s)]
*  largely he says because he was so insistent [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=42.6s)]
*  that Joe Biden was going to be a disaster electorally. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=45.32s)]
*  So I want to check in with Cenk and see what he makes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=48.92s)]
*  of the current DNC machinations to coronate Kamala [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=51.44s)]
*  in this bizarre private process and see if that satisfies [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=55.92s)]
*  the grievances that he articulated. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=61.68s)]
*  So Cenk, welcome to System Update with Glenn Greenwald. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=63.24s)]
*  Although I'm not Glenn Greenwald, I'm Michael Tracy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=67.08s)]
*  and I am filling in for the time being. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  So how are you? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm good and I'm familiar with both of your work. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=73.04s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I know. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm good. Thanks for having me on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=78.72s)]
*  Yeah. So Cenk, you, as we said, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=80.36s)]
*  you ran for president. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=85.56s)]
*  Obviously you never maintained that you stood [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=86.88s)]
*  a particularly good chance of winning the nomination. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=90.08s)]
*  That wasn't really the point. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  The point was you wanted to force the issue [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  and get Democrats to realize that if they pressed ahead [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=95.92s)]
*  with Joe Biden, they were going to be in for a nightmare, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=99.96s)]
*  that Donald Trump could romp, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=103.44s)]
*  that Joe Biden didn't have the capacity [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=106.6s)]
*  to run a vigorous campaign. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=109.0s)]
*  And I want to just pull up a primary ballot. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=112.56s)]
*  Your name was on one of these ballots, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  along with Dean Phillips and Ariane Williamson [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=118.64s)]
*  and of course, Joe Biden, but conspicuously missing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=121.0s)]
*  from that list of candidates was Kamala Harris. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  So one of the points that I've been making is that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=128.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris is being ushered to the nomination [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=130.28s)]
*  through a process that has remarkably little actual [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=135.44s)]
*  small D democratic input from voters. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=139.44s)]
*  She hasn't had to win a single vote, a single primary. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=143.28s)]
*  She got a grand total of zero delegates in 2020 [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=146.12s)]
*  and zero in 2024, at least if you go by state [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=149.4s)]
*  and territory primary election outcomes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=152.28s)]
*  So I thought we were going to get this open convention [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=155.72s)]
*  process where they could have a mini primary [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=158.12s)]
*  or something truncated to actually gauge the will [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=160.36s)]
*  of the electorate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=163.12s)]
*  And in fact, Joe Biden was denouncing these insider [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=164.4s)]
*  maneuvers against him just in the past couple of weeks [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=168.04s)]
*  as he said that they would thwart the will [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=170.48s)]
*  of the primary voters. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=172.6s)]
*  And we're now even told that the DNC is going to have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=174.92s)]
*  a virtual nomination still, a virtual roll call [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=176.64s)]
*  before the convention, basically negating the whole purpose [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  of the convention, which they were going to do with Biden. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=183.32s)]
*  Now they're going to keep doing with Kamala [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=185.64s)]
*  so that nobody can even contest it apparently on the floor [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=187.76s)]
*  or the whole purpose of a convention has now been overturned. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  So what do you make of it? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=194.2s)]
*  I mean, does this satisfy your criticisms [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  of how the primary process was conducted [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=198.88s)]
*  now that Kamala is just having the red carpet rolled out for? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, let's start with a fun fact. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=205.92s)]
*  I have received more votes for president [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=208.0s)]
*  than Kamala Harris has. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  That is a fun fact, that is a very fun fact. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=212.76s)]
*  Yeah, and not only am I just an online talk show host, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  but I'm a naturalized citizen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=221.12s)]
*  So that's why I was only on seven ballots. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=224.32s)]
*  That's a civil rights issue [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=228.32s)]
*  we somebody should get back to someday. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=229.72s)]
*  But that was of course not the primary reason that I ran. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=232.24s)]
*  I ran as I stated from the beginning [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=237.68s)]
*  and in almost every interview that I did, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=239.96s)]
*  it was an act of desperation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=242.32s)]
*  Cause I felt like we were all on board the Titanic [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=244.4s)]
*  and we all saw the iceberg, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=248.28s)]
*  or at least a lot of us saw the iceberg apparently. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=252.2s)]
*  And I was actually surprised later in the process [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=254.88s)]
*  to find out that Blue Maga existed [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=257.2s)]
*  and that they actually had not seen, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  they didn't see the iceberg at all until the debate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  But I saw it, I know a bunch of people saw it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=263.88s)]
*  and I thought, well, it doesn't look like anybody's gonna [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=266.56s)]
*  do anything about it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=268.8s)]
*  So I'm just gonna lunge into the captain's quarters [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=270.0s)]
*  and try to move the wheel because otherwise we're toast [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=272.48s)]
*  and Donald Trump's gonna win [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=276.0s)]
*  and God knows what happens to democracy, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=277.12s)]
*  So, but you know what? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=280.6s)]
*  All the folks who decided to try to make a difference, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  whether it was like, and it is strange, bad fellows. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=286.68s)]
*  I don't know anyone who criticizes Nancy Pelosi [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=291.0s)]
*  more than I do. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  And so me and Nancy Pelosi on the same side, that is weird. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  And Ezra Klein and James Carville and David Axelrod. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, let's also note Axelrod top advisor [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=304.72s)]
*  to Barack Obama, James Carville top advisor to the Clintons [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=308.6s)]
*  and no one got the memo. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=312.0s)]
*  I'm like, it's the Obamas and the Clintons [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=313.68s)]
*  are telling you there's something wrong with Joe Biden [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=316.4s)]
*  and you knuckleheads aren't getting it, right? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=319.04s)]
*  So there's the old fights Michael [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=321.72s)]
*  between progressives versus establishment. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=324.16s)]
*  And in this particular election, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=326.72s)]
*  since I'm one of the few Democrats [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=328.88s)]
*  who actually think that democracy is on the line, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=330.2s)]
*  it led to a completely different coalitions. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=333.44s)]
*  People who were perfectly happy to lose to Donald Trump [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=336.8s)]
*  and people who really, really didn't wanna lose [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=339.88s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=341.84s)]
*  So me, Carville, et cetera, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=342.8s)]
*  were the ones who didn't wanna lose to Donald Trump. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=344.92s)]
*  Blue Mago was like, who cares? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=346.76s)]
*  As long as we obey democratic leadership, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=348.52s)]
*  that's what Morning Joe taught me. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=351.48s)]
*  Oh, I have to bow my head. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=353.12s)]
*  The top value of the democratic party is obedience, right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=354.28s)]
*  I'm like, man, you guys have lost a thread. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=357.92s)]
*  You completely forgot what the democratic party [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  was supposed to be at. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  So am I satisfied with the result? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=363.76s)]
*  Well, I'm enormously satisfied [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  that Joe Biden's out of the race [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=368.84s)]
*  because we went from about a 0% chance of winning [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=370.8s)]
*  to about a 50% chance of winning. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=373.44s)]
*  So hard to not be satisfied with that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=375.52s)]
*  Now, when you talk about, okay, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=378.12s)]
*  but what about the process of democracy? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  Was that fulfilled here? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=383.52s)]
*  Oh, of course not. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=385.12s)]
*  But look, democracy has a number of issues [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=386.24s)]
*  in current day American politics. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=390.8s)]
*  And then I'm gonna get to, yes, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=394.68s)]
*  but what's the best we can do, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  So number one, come on, the donors control everything. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=397.92s)]
*  We don't have a real democracy anyway, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  And I talked about this in my book, Justice is Coming. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=404.04s)]
*  Person in Northwestern did a 20-year study, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=406.6s)]
*  1,800 policy issues. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  The bottom 90% of Americans have zero effect [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  on public policy, absolutely zero, okay? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=415.56s)]
*  The top 10%, they don't control everything, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=418.92s)]
*  but when they want something, they get a 45% of the time. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=421.24s)]
*  So already it's hilarious and ridiculous. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Reid Hoffman today gave $7 million [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  to Kamala Harrison, demanded that Lena Kahn will be fired. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=434.44s)]
*  She'll be fired. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=435.28s)]
*  APAC went and bought all of Congress, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=437.47999999999996s)]
*  then Yahu, a notorious war criminal, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  one of the most evil men of my lifetime, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=443.0s)]
*  getting standing ovation after standing ovation. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=444.91999999999996s)]
*  So what democracy? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=446.96s)]
*  But secondly, when you get into the primaries, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=449.88s)]
*  the democratic primaries are a joke [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=452.08s)]
*  and have been for a long time. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=453.68s)]
*  So under the bullshit rubric of unity, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=456.0s)]
*  notice they never have unity around progressives. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=460.2s)]
*  There's never any unity [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=462.84s)]
*  other than corporate democratic leadership. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=464.08s)]
*  So this was a sham primary. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=467.32s)]
*  Again, I know because I was in it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=470.24s)]
*  In Florida, they just canceled the election. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=471.76s)]
*  North Carolina, Tennessee, they didn't just take me off. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=474.64s)]
*  A lot of states took me off [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=476.88s)]
*  because of the naturalized citizen issue. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=477.91999999999996s)]
*  That's a totally different thing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=479.52s)]
*  But they took Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=481.16s)]
*  off of the balance of North Carolina, Tennessee. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=483.48s)]
*  The joke of a primary. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=485.8s)]
*  And I kept saying the whole time [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  and mainstream media just didn't pay any attention [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=488.8s)]
*  because running against Joe Biden [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=490.6s)]
*  was a violation of etiquette. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  And so I was the bad guy. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=494.04s)]
*  I was a radical for wanting democracy. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  And I would say like, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=498.16s)]
*  if you're gonna try to defend democracy [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=499.32000000000005s)]
*  in a general election, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  wouldn't it be nice if you had one in the primaries? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=502.32000000000005s)]
*  And people in mainstream media were like, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=504.88s)]
*  how dare you bow your head to Joe Biden? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  He's the most young dynamic guy that anybody's ever seen. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=509.2s)]
*  But Michael, at this point, that ship is sailed. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=512.6s)]
*  So then the next layer of it is, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=515.08s)]
*  okay, I call for an open convention [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=517.0s)]
*  as Ezra Klein did and others did. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=519.08s)]
*  And that's obviously the last message we have of democracy [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=521.8s)]
*  at this point. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=525.08s)]
*  And at this point, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=526.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris has gotten the majority of the pledge delegates. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=527.64s)]
*  No one's even running against her. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=531.72s)]
*  I mean, the Democratic Party, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=533.2s)]
*  which is incredibly frustrating. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=536.08s)]
*  So she's gonna be the nominee. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=540.04s)]
*  Let us at least go to the convention. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=542.32s)]
*  Nope, nope. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=544.16s)]
*  They're lying about Ohio this [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=545.48s)]
*  and we can't get on the ballots that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=548.0s)]
*  And so they're gonna do a virtual roll call on August 7th [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=549.64s)]
*  and snuff out any delegates changing their mind [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=553.28s)]
*  before the convention, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=556.76s)]
*  because the DNC is authoritarian by nature. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=557.68s)]
*  So they just can't help themselves. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=561.12s)]
*  But with a straight face, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=564.24s)]
*  they'll say they're wanting to protect democracy. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=565.44s)]
*  And these same guys who wanted to keep their job [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=567.96s)]
*  because Biden hired them, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=570.52s)]
*  were willing to totally risk democracy [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=572.4000000000001s)]
*  and give Donald Trump about a 99% chance of winning. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=575.96s)]
*  So Jenk, on that note, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=581.24s)]
*  I wanna just quote to you. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=585.24s)]
*  This was a letter that Joe Biden delivered [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=586.6s)]
*  to congressional Democrats on July 8th. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=589.88s)]
*  This was the same day that he had his infamous defiance [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=593.1600000000001s)]
*  morning Joe call him. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=595.96s)]
*  Here's what he wrote in that letter. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  And maybe I'm unusual because I actually read the letter. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=598.88s)]
*  And I remember it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=602.0s)]
*  It was only a couple of weeks ago. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=602.84s)]
*  I know everything we just throw down the memory hole [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=603.92s)]
*  at warp speed nowadays. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  But he says, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=608.52s)]
*  "'The voters of the Democratic Party have voted. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=609.84s)]
*  "'They have chosen me as the nominee of the party. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  "'Do we just now say that this process didn't matter, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=614.92s)]
*  "'that the voters don't have a say? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=617.8s)]
*  "'I declined to do that,' he says. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=619.56s)]
*  "'I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=621.84s)]
*  "'of the voters of the Democratic Party [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=625.88s)]
*  "'who have placed in me this year.' [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=627.76s)]
*  "'It was their decision to make, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=629.56s)]
*  "'not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=630.6s)]
*  "'not any selected group of individuals, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=634.12s)]
*  "'no matter how well intentioned. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=635.96s)]
*  "'The voters and the voters alone [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=637.4s)]
*  "'decide the nominee of the Democratic Party.'" [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=639.0s)]
*  And this is the kicker, okay, Jenk? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=641.28s)]
*  Biden says, "'How can we stand for democracy in our nation [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=644.08s)]
*  "'if we ignore it in our own party? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=647.6s)]
*  "'I cannot do that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=650.4s)]
*  "'I will not do that.'" [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=651.48s)]
*  So how are the Democrats, with a straight face, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=653.48s)]
*  gonna start screaming as they have incessantly forever? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  And you apparently agree on the substance of this point. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  I might quibble a little bit. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=663.84s)]
*  I think a lot of the rhetoric around democracy [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=665.12s)]
*  and Trump overturning it [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=667.72s)]
*  tends to be a bit histrionic and overblown, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=669.6s)]
*  but that's more of a substantive conflict we may have. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=672.12s)]
*  But in terms of the consistency [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=677.96s)]
*  of the Democrats' own messaging, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=679.44s)]
*  Joe Biden himself is the one who said [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=681.16s)]
*  that it would be undermined [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=683.9599999999999s)]
*  if they allow this insider push to go forward. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=685.48s)]
*  So are we just gonna now memory-hole this letter? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=690.04s)]
*  Is Joe Biden really now gonna be so cast by the wayside [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=692.9599999999999s)]
*  that everybody's supposed to forget Ezra Klein, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=696.8s)]
*  Matthew Iglesias, Thomas Friedman, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=699.12s)]
*  The Washington Post, Vox, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=701.64s)]
*  name your Democratic-aligned pundit or media outlet. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  Are we all gonna forget that two and a half weeks ago, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=706.92s)]
*  Joe Biden said that if you go through with this ouster of me, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=710.4s)]
*  it means that our own party, the Democratic Party, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=713.84s)]
*  is thwarting democracy? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, to me, it just seems, I feel crazy. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=719.12s)]
*  Yeah, look, Joe Biden wrote that same letter [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=723.2s)]
*  for the same reason that he said, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=726.12s)]
*  you know what, I demand to have a primary in Florida. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=728.36s)]
*  I can't believe they canceled that election. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=731.44s)]
*  And I demand that everybody be put back on the ballot [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=733.96s)]
*  in North Carolina and Tennessee during the primaries. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=736.76s)]
*  And I demand that we do debates during the primaries [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=741.2s)]
*  so the candidates could be tested [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=743.84s)]
*  and that the voters get what they want. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=746.08s)]
*  Oh, right, he didn't do any of that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=747.8000000000001s)]
*  No, he's monumentally full of crap. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=749.36s)]
*  He loved that the primary was totally authoritarian, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=752.88s)]
*  totally rigged to not only make sure that he was a candidate, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=756.96s)]
*  but that he was protected and hidden in a basement [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=761.36s)]
*  and that he wouldn't have to actually run against any of us. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=764.28s)]
*  I mean, look, they were hiding him from me, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=767.16s)]
*  Marianne Williamson, and Dean Phillips. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  They knew he was gonna lose. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=772.24s)]
*  If you can't beat us in an open debate [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=773.9599999999999s)]
*  or in an open and fair contest, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=776.56s)]
*  of course you were gonna get your ass handed to you, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=779.0s)]
*  even by a moron like Donald Trump. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=781.24s)]
*  So that letter is garbage, it's trash. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=784.0s)]
*  He never meant a word of it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=787.36s)]
*  So I don't really care about that letter [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=789.24s)]
*  just because I already know that Joe Biden's a hypocrite. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=790.88s)]
*  But look, that goes to the point that I'm making. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=793.56s)]
*  So I'm one of the few people who actually believe it [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=795.28s)]
*  because I think Donald Trump had fake electors [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=798.4799999999999s)]
*  and that's a real coup attempt against democracy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=802.2399999999999s)]
*  And he's a spoiled little brat [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=806.28s)]
*  and he wanted to take his toy and go home when he lost. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=808.0s)]
*  And so he's a super dangerous guy to have in charge [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  and just never believed in democracy, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=817.4s)]
*  praises dictators at every turn. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  Let me stop you there. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=822.56s)]
*  Let's delve into this a little bit for a second. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=823.4s)]
*  Okay, yeah, finish your thought. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=825.96s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=826.8s)]
*  Hold on, let me just finish the thought. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=827.64s)]
*  Go ahead, yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=828.48s)]
*  So, but I have proven that I'm not a hypocrite on that. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  That I actually believe in democracy [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=833.6s)]
*  all the way through the process [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  and I actually believe that he's a danger to democracy. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=836.96s)]
*  That's why I did the desperate thing that I did, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=839.52s)]
*  which helped a little bit [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=841.72s)]
*  in setting the party in the right direction. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  But everyone else who pretended [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=845.76s)]
*  this is the most important election of our lifetime [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=849.24s)]
*  and democracy was on the line, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=851.04s)]
*  and they're like, yeah, we don't mind losing [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=852.64s)]
*  as long as we're obeying Joe Biden. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  Those guys apparently never meant it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=855.48s)]
*  Yeah, so let's delve into this notion [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=857.84s)]
*  that Donald Trump represents [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=859.92s)]
*  some profound threat to democracy. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=861.32s)]
*  This couldn't be more standard rhetoric [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=862.84s)]
*  among democratic partisans. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=865.48s)]
*  And you say you believe it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=867.64s)]
*  I believe you that you're sincere [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=868.96s)]
*  and you are contention on that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=870.88s)]
*  And I will also acknowledge that you're consistent [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=872.48s)]
*  in matching your actions with your words [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=875.32s)]
*  because you took the rather drastic step [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=877.92s)]
*  of even running yourself to try to make clear [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=880.16s)]
*  that you thought the threat was so severe [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=883.28s)]
*  that it compelled you to throw your own hat in the ring. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=886.92s)]
*  So I fully acknowledge that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=890.0799999999999s)]
*  But I don't know, shouldn't we step back for a moment? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=891.88s)]
*  Does Donald Trump throwing a hissy fit [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=895.36s)]
*  after the 2020 election [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=897.6s)]
*  and trying to come up with cockamamie theories [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=899.52s)]
*  as to how Mike Pence could potentially take [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=902.52s)]
*  a different set of electors [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=907.28s)]
*  than the one sent by the states [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=908.76s)]
*  and that was denied by Pence. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=910.8s)]
*  And then he whips up a mob of yahoos [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=913.28s)]
*  who really had no ability [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  or even seeming intention to overthrow [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=921.88s)]
*  the United States government. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=924.6s)]
*  I mean, temporarily delaying a legislative proceeding [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=925.92s)]
*  on January 6th of 2021 [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=929.88s)]
*  never even had the ability or the possibility [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=932.4399999999999s)]
*  of actually in any way implementing a coup [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=937.32s)]
*  in the United States government. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  That's outlandish rhetoric to underscore [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=943.4000000000001s)]
*  the preexisting grievances [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=947.0s)]
*  that people have about Donald Trump. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=948.36s)]
*  So I agree and people on the right get mad at me [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=949.5600000000001s)]
*  all the time because I don't buy into the election fraud [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=952.08s)]
*  stuff that I don't feel has ever been [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=954.88s)]
*  remotely empirically proven. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=956.6400000000001s)]
*  But Donald Trump throwing a tantrum [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=958.44s)]
*  and then leaving power and now running again. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, so let me ask you this. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=965.6s)]
*  What would Trump do if he were to win this time [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=966.8s)]
*  that would actually sabotage democracy? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=970.04s)]
*  Would he not obey the constitution [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=972.88s)]
*  and leave power after a second term? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=975.88s)]
*  Would he defy the 22nd amendment? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=977.7199999999999s)]
*  I think that's the correct amendment. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=979.9599999999999s)]
*  Like what tangibly would he do [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=981.3599999999999s)]
*  that would throw, flush democracy down the toilet? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=984.0s)]
*  That's what I'm not clear on the specifics [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=988.04s)]
*  of what people are alleging when they make this argument. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=989.88s)]
*  Yeah, so he would do anything and everything to keep power. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=993.28s)]
*  He has said that he would suspend the constitution. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=997.2s)]
*  So he's not unclear about it, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1000.52s)]
*  but Michael, you're incredibly wrong [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1003.48s)]
*  about what he did after the 2020 election. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1006.12s)]
*  It was not some sort of like, yeah, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  is he a spoiled brat who didn't like that he lost [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1011.64s)]
*  and he's a loser and he has been his whole life? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1014.32s)]
*  Yes, but it was not inconsequential [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  and it totally could have worked. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1019.12s)]
*  So let me explain that plot. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1021.8s)]
*  So, and Peter Navarro wrote a whole book about it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1023.52s)]
*  They have memo after memo, which I've read, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1026.08s)]
*  including a memo that said fake elector memorandum. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1028.32s)]
*  So, and in fact, I just interviewed Rudy Giuliani [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1032.48s)]
*  at the RNC and he admitted a part of the plot. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1034.96s)]
*  So the idea wasn't just a delay on that day. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1037.52s)]
*  So what I, look, mainstream media is super frustrating [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1040.28s)]
*  because oftentimes they're simpletons [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1043.44s)]
*  and they can't really, they just wanna show you pictures [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1045.36s)]
*  and they can't really explain concepts. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1048.52s)]
*  So the guys who entered the Capitol on January 6th, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1051.16s)]
*  it's not like they were gonna keep the building [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1055.44s)]
*  and that somehow that was going to be the coup. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1057.68s)]
*  And I feel like Democrats and mainstream media [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1060.4s)]
*  leave people with that impression. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1062.24s)]
*  That's preposterous. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1063.48s)]
*  No, their job in this plot [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1064.92s)]
*  was simply to delay the proceedings. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1066.88s)]
*  So why would delaying the proceedings matter? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1069.4s)]
*  Because the next step in that plot, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1071.92s)]
*  again, written by Eastman, who is Trump's lawyer is, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1074.2s)]
*  then you say, well, since we couldn't certify the election, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1078.16s)]
*  we have no choice but to go back to the state legislatures [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1082.92s)]
*  and ask who are their electors that they wanna send up. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1086.44s)]
*  Now, at that point, that's when they had the fake electors [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1090.44s)]
*  that were ready to go. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1093.72s)]
*  But, Jack, this was a care-brain scheme [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1094.8400000000001s)]
*  that Eastman cooked up in concert [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1097.0800000000002s)]
*  with other Trump operatives to try to invoke some, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1099.3600000000001s)]
*  I think, unsound, unfounded constitutional strategy [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1103.24s)]
*  whereby they could delay the certification of the votes [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1108.32s)]
*  and have the veracity of the election outcomes [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1112.04s)]
*  in individual states re-tabulated. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1115.8400000000001s)]
*  And the idea was they would prove that some fraud took place [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1119.52s)]
*  and therefore the legitimate electors [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1123.48s)]
*  would be awarded to Trump. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1126.16s)]
*  I don't think that that was a defensible strategy. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1127.72s)]
*  All I'm saying is to conflate that with an attempt [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1131.72s)]
*  to overthrow the government, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1134.0800000000002s)]
*  or abolish democracy, or carry out a coup. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1135.8s)]
*  I mean, this is insane democratic hyperbole [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1139.3600000000001s)]
*  and all the more ridiculous given what Biden just said [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1143.1200000000001s)]
*  is the undemocratic tendencies [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1146.1200000000001s)]
*  within the Democratic Party itself. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1147.96s)]
*  I mean, they even had Democrats in individual states [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1149.28s)]
*  try to strike Trump from ballots [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1153.52s)]
*  by invoking this insurrection clause of the Constitution. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1155.68s)]
*  And the Supreme Court unanimously said [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1158.92s)]
*  that that was not legitimate. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1162.64s)]
*  So I just think that if you wanna talk about democracy, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1163.48s)]
*  I'm not saying you, but if Democrats or whomever [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1165.2800000000002s)]
*  wants to venerate the sanctity of democracy, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1167.96s)]
*  well, you have points that are scored on each side [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1170.92s)]
*  in terms of democratic infringements, right? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1174.44s)]
*  Including on the Democratic side and the Republican side. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1176.8400000000001s)]
*  Doesn't mean that they're equal. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1178.96s)]
*  And I agree that what Trump did [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1180.16s)]
*  after the 2020 election was discreditable, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1181.48s)]
*  but it seems like there's this inveterate need [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1183.76s)]
*  for Democrats to just chronically exaggerate [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1186.96s)]
*  what that actually signified. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1189.64s)]
*  And the reality is there was never a chance. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1192.2800000000002s)]
*  It was impossible that it ever would have [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1196.5600000000002s)]
*  actually overthrown the government. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1197.92s)]
*  No, you're totally wrong about that, Michael. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1200.6000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, look, again, consistent. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1202.8400000000001s)]
*  I thought the idea of taking Trump off the, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1206.2s)]
*  because the insurrection act off the ballots was absurd. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1209.48s)]
*  I spoke out against that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1213.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, you wanna say Democrats are hypocrites [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1215.5600000000002s)]
*  and don't really believe what they mean? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1217.44s)]
*  Of course, they're politicians [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1219.04s)]
*  and politicians controlled by donors. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1221.32s)]
*  That's not an issue for me. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1223.48s)]
*  But when you're excusing what Trump did and minimizing it, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1224.92s)]
*  I think you're factually- [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1228.36s)]
*  I'm not excusing it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1229.2s)]
*  I'm saying it hasn't been [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1230.04s)]
*  proportionately depicted. Let me finish. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1230.92s)]
*  Yeah. Let me finish. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1232.84s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1234.68s)]
*  So the part that you didn't let me finish [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1235.52s)]
*  is that when they kick it back to the states [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1237.48s)]
*  and they bring in the fake electors, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1240.48s)]
*  and Rudy Giuliani, I asked him, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1242.84s)]
*  hey, Trump already had an alternate slate of electors [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1245.16s)]
*  as each candidate does, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1248.84s)]
*  why don't you guys just use that [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1250.6s)]
*  instead of the fake electors? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1252.08s)]
*  He said, because half of them wouldn't do it [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1253.6399999999999s)]
*  because they knew that it was illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1255.6399999999999s)]
*  So now what would be the next step? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1258.28s)]
*  The next step is they would then not say, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1261.1599999999999s)]
*  oh, the fake electors win. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1263.76s)]
*  They would say, well, now we have these electors [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  and these other electors, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1267.6399999999999s)]
*  and golly gee, we don't know who the real electors are. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1269.1599999999999s)]
*  So I guess we're gonna have to go [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1272.48s)]
*  to what the constitution says next, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1273.9199999999998s)]
*  which is that in a case of this kind of deadlock, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1275.9199999999998s)]
*  the house decides, but the house votes by state, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1278.76s)]
*  and the Republicans had more states [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1282.96s)]
*  than the Democrats did. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1285.12s)]
*  So the minute you bring in the fake electors, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1286.48s)]
*  they're gonna say there's confusion [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1289.48s)]
*  and they're gonna win on that [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1291.0s)]
*  because the press will go, I don't know, 50-50. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1292.64s)]
*  I can't tell who the real electors are, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1294.84s)]
*  in which case you go to the house and yes, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1296.92s)]
*  then the Republicans would have put Trump in [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1299.28s)]
*  and voila, there's your coup [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1301.52s)]
*  when he definitely didn't win the election. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1303.32s)]
*  So it was a perfectly realistic plot. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1305.48s)]
*  That's what was so scary about it. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1307.72s)]
*  And to be fair to the Eastmans and Navarros, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1309.76s)]
*  it was a smart plot. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1312.8400000000001s)]
*  They actually definitely could have done it [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  and they were in the middle of doing it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1316.64s)]
*  And if you think it was inconsequential [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1318.28s)]
*  and they didn't really mean it, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1320.52s)]
*  maybe I should ask Mike Pence. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1321.4s)]
*  I mean, they were chanting, hang Mike Pence, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1323.16s)]
*  hang Mike Pence. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1324.88s)]
*  People looking to murder Trump's vice president. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1325.8400000000001s)]
*  Trump said, when informed of that by his chief of staff, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1328.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't mind. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1331.8s)]
*  So this guy's kind of a murderous dictator. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1332.96s)]
*  So you're telling me, oh no, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  he won't try another coup attempt. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1337.76s)]
*  They had a three hour conversation in the White House [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1339.68s)]
*  where they considered martial law [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1342.64s)]
*  and rolling out the tanks against the American people. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1344.44s)]
*  And to the credit of the Trump, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  the rest of the Trump team, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1349.52s)]
*  they threatened to resign en masse if he did that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1350.8s)]
*  But General Michael Flynn was making that argument [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1354.04s)]
*  and Donald Trump was very receptive to that argument. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1356.96s)]
*  So no, he's definitely a dictator wannabe [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  and you'd be taking a wild, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1362.68s)]
*  terrible risk with democracy if you put him back in. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1364.56s)]
*  Here's my problem with that variation [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1368.1599999999999s)]
*  of a Trump critique, Cenk. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1371.04s)]
*  And I think you'll probably have some sympathy with this. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1372.32s)]
*  My frustration is that Trump has governed [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1374.76s)]
*  in a far more quote, establishment fashion [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1377.56s)]
*  or a far more conventional fashion [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1381.28s)]
*  than these hyperbolic portrayals of him [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1384.72s)]
*  would lead the average person to believe. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1387.6799999999998s)]
*  I call him Jeb Bush with a wacky Twitter account. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1390.12s)]
*  That was how the first term largely went. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1393.44s)]
*  There were a couple of exceptions around the margins. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1395.68s)]
*  But he tried to do a regime change in Venezuela. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1398.0800000000002s)]
*  He bombed Syria several times. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1402.0s)]
*  He vetoed a war powers resolution [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1404.72s)]
*  to keep immiserating Yemen. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1406.96s)]
*  He started arming Ukraine [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1409.92s)]
*  and he defied what Obama had done on that score. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1412.1200000000001s)]
*  He abrogated arms control treaties with Russia. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1415.56s)]
*  And on and on and on, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1419.88s)]
*  a lot of these actual policy measures that he introduced, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1421.56s)]
*  I mean, the one big legislative item [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1424.9199999999998s)]
*  that the Republicans passed [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  when they had unified control of government [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1428.36s)]
*  in the first part of Trump's term [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1430.1599999999999s)]
*  was just corporate tax cuts. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1431.76s)]
*  It wasn't something that was dictatorial, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1433.12s)]
*  So I feel that the more grounded critique of Trump, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1436.24s)]
*  at least in my estimation, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1439.6s)]
*  kind of gets lost in the hysteria [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1441.1599999999999s)]
*  when people run around screaming [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1443.52s)]
*  that, oh, Trump is this dictator. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1445.32s)]
*  My criticism would more be, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1446.84s)]
*  Trump actually isn't taking on the deep state. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1449.24s)]
*  We had the Project 2025 guy on this show last night [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1452.3200000000002s)]
*  and I've got him basically to admit [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1455.0800000000002s)]
*  what that whole supposedly devious plan prescribes [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  is basically just bipartisan continuity [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1460.56s)]
*  when it comes to national security and foreign policy. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1462.68s)]
*  On Israel, Trump brags that he's the best president [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1466.24s)]
*  Israel could ever have hoped for [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1469.24s)]
*  and Netanyahu reiterated that yesterday. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1470.6000000000001s)]
*  So I guess in general, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1472.72s)]
*  and I wonder if you have any sympathy [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1474.96s)]
*  with this point of view, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1476.44s)]
*  my issue is that when people fixate so relentlessly [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1477.92s)]
*  on some of these speculative, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1482.5600000000002s)]
*  and I would say overblown notions of Trump [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  wielding some kind of dictatorial power, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1486.48s)]
*  what gets lost in the fray [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1488.44s)]
*  is the reality of how Trump governed, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1490.3200000000002s)]
*  which was really very much establishmentarian, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1492.8000000000002s)]
*  maybe a few twists and tinkers around the margins, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1496.0s)]
*  but far from what a lot of his most ardent supporters [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1499.88s)]
*  try to valorize him as, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1502.8000000000002s)]
*  which is this warrior against the deep state [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1505.04s)]
*  who is opposed by every establishment faction, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1508.32s)]
*  which is just not true. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1512.2s)]
*  I mean, he's getting money poured into his coffers [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1513.48s)]
*  from every private equity tycoon in the world right now. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1516.76s)]
*  And I feel like that critique is elided [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1519.88s)]
*  when people of your disposition [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1522.96s)]
*  focus so relentlessly on the democracy is at stake line. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1525.28s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple of different points here. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1531.6s)]
*  So first of all, I actually agree with you [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1533.12s)]
*  that in the first term, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1535.9599999999998s)]
*  he managed mainly as a corporate Republican. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1537.32s)]
*  And that's why I would not have flipped out [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1541.8799999999999s)]
*  if he hadn't tried to do the coup attempt [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  and he said that he was gonna bring in [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  the same kind of establishment figures [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1552.32s)]
*  because they provided a break in the car. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1554.2399999999998s)]
*  And whenever he had some stupid idea, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1557.12s)]
*  they would talk him out of it or just ignore him. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1559.2399999999998s)]
*  And look, the administrative state is in charge [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1561.6s)]
*  both during Republican and Democratic administrations. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1563.76s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden says he can function [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1568.32s)]
*  between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1570.6s)]
*  and after eight, he can't do anything. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1573.48s)]
*  So obviously he's not fully in charge. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1575.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris was gonna give a speech on Palestine in March [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1579.6799999999998s)]
*  and it got edited by the National Security Council. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1582.8s)]
*  So obviously she's not in charge. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1586.1599999999999s)]
*  And during Donald Trump, he would give insane orders. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1588.1599999999999s)]
*  He said, I wanna increase the amount of nuclear weapons [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1590.8s)]
*  we have by 10-fold. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1594.08s)]
*  And they walked out of the meeting and Rex Tillerson said, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1596.28s)]
*  he's a fucking idiot, let's just ignore him. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1600.0s)]
*  And they all did. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1602.28s)]
*  And that happened over and over again [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1603.24s)]
*  because he's too stupid to realize [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1605.36s)]
*  they never even followed his orders. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1606.96s)]
*  That would have bankrupted the country anyway. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1608.24s)]
*  But one of the things I am concerned about [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1610.24s)]
*  this time around, Michael, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1612.0s)]
*  is that he's saying that he's not going to have [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1613.28s)]
*  the same establishment figures. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1615.32s)]
*  Now I load the establishment figures [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1617.24s)]
*  because they're all corrupt [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1618.96s)]
*  and they all work for the donors, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1619.8400000000001s)]
*  but they're not insane. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1621.5600000000002s)]
*  They have different problems. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1623.6000000000001s)]
*  Insanity is not one of them. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1625.04s)]
*  But if he removes all those people [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1626.76s)]
*  and he just goes with his instincts, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1629.04s)]
*  oh, then we're cooked. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1630.88s)]
*  His instincts are maniacal. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1632.8000000000002s)]
*  So, I mean, you could go back to the dictator stuff [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1634.88s)]
*  where every time he talks to ironically communist dictators [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1637.96s)]
*  like Kim Jong-un, Xi Jinping, et cetera, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1641.72s)]
*  he says, man, it's amazing. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1644.76s)]
*  People always stand up and applaud him [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1647.04s)]
*  and no matter what he says, they listen to it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1649.12s)]
*  Yeah, because otherwise he murders them. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1651.0s)]
*  Anyway, and then in terms of policy, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1654.3999999999999s)]
*  I think these mega policies are super extreme [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1658.6s)]
*  and without the establishment breaks in the car, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1661.04s)]
*  they're going to run that car right off that cliff. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1663.72s)]
*  So that's a second giant problem in re-electing Donald Trump. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1666.36s)]
*  But, Cenk, I can just hear the online right-wingers [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1670.6399999999999s)]
*  swelling with glee, hearing you postulate [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1674.32s)]
*  that in a second term, Trump is going to diverge dramatically [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1679.24s)]
*  from all these establishment influences [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1683.6799999999998s)]
*  because that's what they want, right? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1685.4399999999998s)]
*  But I was at the Republican National Convention [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1687.3999999999999s)]
*  last week too. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1689.4399999999998s)]
*  I saw you briefly, but I was running around like a maniac [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1690.28s)]
*  so we didn't get a chance to talk that much. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1692.72s)]
*  But I grilled a lot of Republicans on this very point. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1694.28s)]
*  And one thing that a lot of them told me was, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1698.12s)]
*  don't worry, all these hysterical liberal fears of Trump [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1700.8s)]
*  are once again overwrought [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1705.96s)]
*  because guess who he's going to be bringing back [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1707.32s)]
*  into the fold? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1709.1599999999999s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, who also had a prime speaking role [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1710.04s)]
*  at the convention again, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1713.28s)]
*  Robert O'Brien, who was another Trump national security [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1714.96s)]
*  advisor who was on Face the Nation recently [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1719.12s)]
*  and was saying, look, we need to sanction Russia [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1724.04s)]
*  even harder than Biden. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1726.0s)]
*  That's how we're going to force some kind of settlement [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1727.44s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1729.1599999999999s)]
*  He's surrounded by people associated with this thing [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1730.52s)]
*  called the America First Policy Institute [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1733.24s)]
*  who are submitting to him policy proposals [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1735.32s)]
*  about how the US has to keep arming Ukraine. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1737.84s)]
*  So it's the polar opposite of these MSNBC style histrionics [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1741.12s)]
*  about how Trump is Putin's puppet. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1746.4s)]
*  He's going to totally depart [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1748.2s)]
*  from mainstream policy consensus. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1750.0s)]
*  I just don't really buy it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1752.48s)]
*  And I think it's kind of unjustifiably almost glamorizing [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1754.08s)]
*  or valorizing of Trump to assume that he even has [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1759.24s)]
*  the organizational focus or presence of mind [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1762.1999999999998s)]
*  or even interest to do something [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1766.52s)]
*  that's genuinely anti-establishmentarianism. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1767.96s)]
*  Who are these anti-establishment figures [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1770.72s)]
*  that he's supposedly going to be filling [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1772.36s)]
*  his administration with? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1774.12s)]
*  I don't know who they are. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1775.36s)]
*  Everybody who's been basically cultivated [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1776.6799999999998s)]
*  by this so-called Project 2025 thing [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1779.08s)]
*  are they're just conventional DC conservatives. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1781.12s)]
*  So I just don't really see this outcome [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1783.56s)]
*  that your warning is so much likelier [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1787.08s)]
*  under a second Trump term. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1789.0s)]
*  Yeah, so here again, I partly agree. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1791.8s)]
*  So Trump is both complicated and simple. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1794.84s)]
*  So he's complicated in that you can't pigeonhole him [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1798.6s)]
*  as purely establishment or purely populist. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1801.72s)]
*  I mean, again, I think he's a fake populist. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1805.0s)]
*  Or put aside the word populist. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1807.9199999999998s)]
*  Jamie Dimon as his secretary of the treasury. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1810.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1812.6399999999999s)]
*  So I get it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1814.3999999999999s)]
*  And he's definitely not purely MAGA. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1815.44s)]
*  So he's complicated in that he doesn't fit [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1818.92s)]
*  into the political spectrum [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1821.88s)]
*  in the conventional way that we think of it. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1823.1200000000001s)]
*  But he's simple in that he's very easy to solve. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1825.96s)]
*  He just cares about what's good for Donald Trump, period. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1829.76s)]
*  End of sentence. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1834.24s)]
*  Doesn't care about anything else, okay? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1835.52s)]
*  So why does he then seem like an establishment character [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1838.3600000000001s)]
*  when he says, oh, maybe I should bring Jamie Dimon in? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1842.28s)]
*  Steve Mnuchin, he had more Goldman Sachs bankers [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1844.8799999999999s)]
*  in his cabinet and his administration [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1848.48s)]
*  than any other president in history. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1850.72s)]
*  So he brings in all of these establishment figures [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1852.84s)]
*  because A, he wants money. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1855.44s)]
*  And he's always very clear about that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1857.9199999999998s)]
*  He's like, look, the Saudis give me 30, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1859.44s)]
*  40 million dollars in apartment. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1861.44s)]
*  What am I gonna do? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1862.6399999999999s)]
*  Not like them? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1863.46s)]
*  So he very likely did money laundering [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1864.72s)]
*  for the Russians earlier in his career. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1868.04s)]
*  So he's like, what am I gonna do? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1869.72s)]
*  Not like them? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1870.6799999999998s)]
*  They gave me money for free. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1871.56s)]
*  I want these oil companies. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1873.36s)]
*  I want them to give me a billion dollars [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1874.1999999999998s)]
*  in campaign donations. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1876.08s)]
*  And then in return, I'll let them rob the place blind. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1878.04s)]
*  Take away all the regulations, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1881.9599999999998s)]
*  take away any taxes they need to pay, et cetera. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1883.76s)]
*  So he's a very transactional, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1887.4399999999998s)]
*  old school, corrupt politician. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1889.6799999999998s)]
*  So that has its own set of problems. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1892.56s)]
*  I mean, on Israel, he moved the US embassy in Israel [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1894.6599999999999s)]
*  and risked World War III. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1899.6799999999998s)]
*  Also in killing Soleimani, he risked World War III [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1901.44s)]
*  because Sheldon Adelson gave him [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1904.76s)]
*  a hundred million dollars in 2016. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1906.8400000000001s)]
*  And then for a job well done, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1908.8000000000002s)]
*  he gave him another a hundred million dollars in 2020. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1910.2s)]
*  And Miriam Adelson was at the Republican convention. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1912.88s)]
*  And Miriam Adelson, you might've seen, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1917.6000000000001s)]
*  was at the Republican convention last week [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1919.1200000000001s)]
*  in one of the VIP suites flanked by Ted Cruz, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1921.16s)]
*  Glenn Yonkin, Carrie Lake, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1924.5800000000002s)]
*  and has pledged a minimum of another 100 million [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1926.48s)]
*  to a Trump super PAC for 2024. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1930.3s)]
*  So that's why I'm trying to suggest [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1932.74s)]
*  that it's probably more of the same [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1934.74s)]
*  more than it is gonna be some radical departure. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1937.12s)]
*  Otherwise, why is he getting showered [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1939.74s)]
*  with even more Adelson money than he had the first time? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1941.3999999999999s)]
*  I think if anything, you could foresee something like Trump [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1945.02s)]
*  just allowing Israel to annex the entire West Bank. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1949.18s)]
*  And actually on that note, Jankin, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1953.06s)]
*  I wanna wrap up on this and I appreciate your time. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1954.5s)]
*  I wanna go to a clip of Kamala Harris actually [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1957.7s)]
*  from APAC, the APAC convention in 2017 [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1960.46s)]
*  and get your reaction to it. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1964.5s)]
*  So let's play that clip, please. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1966.1000000000001s)]
*  So let me be clear about what I believe. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1967.66s)]
*  I stand with Israel because of our shared values, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1970.9s)]
*  which are so fundamental to the founding of both our nations. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1974.92s)]
*  I believe the bonds between the United States and Israel [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1979.74s)]
*  are unbreakable and we can never let anyone [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1982.8200000000002s)]
*  drive a wedge between us. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1986.5s)]
*  Our bonds are rooted in our shared history [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1989.9s)]
*  and are strengthened by the ties between our peoples. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=1996.42s)]
*  And in the words of Shimon Peres, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2001.3400000000001s)]
*  whose loss we mourn so deeply, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2003.5800000000002s)]
*  for Israel's existence, we need the friendship [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2006.6200000000001s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2010.3600000000001s)]
*  And of course, he knew that feeling goes both ways. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2013.3400000000001s)]
*  And there's no question that friendship [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2018.4599999999998s)]
*  and our partnership must be unwavering. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2021.62s)]
*  Okay, so Jake, there's Kamala Harris in March of 2017, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2025.1799999999998s)]
*  shortly after she was first elected Senator [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2033.5s)]
*  and probably was already planning to run for president. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2035.3999999999999s)]
*  And so one of the customary things that you do [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2037.9399999999998s)]
*  when you're an ambitious politician in that role [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2040.22s)]
*  is to go to the APAC conference [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2042.6999999999998s)]
*  and recite all the standard lines [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2044.58s)]
*  and bask in the applause for proclaiming [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2047.0s)]
*  how unshakable the US-Israel relationship is. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2050.08s)]
*  And the reason why I bring that up is in part because, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2053.5s)]
*  now one of the issues that obviously you raised [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2055.96s)]
*  in your Democratic primary campaign against Biden [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2057.64s)]
*  was the Israel-Gaza issue. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2060.8s)]
*  It's something that you cover quite a bit [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2062.52s)]
*  and you obviously have strong feelings on. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2064.32s)]
*  But I am just aghast that Kamala Harris [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2067.2s)]
*  is now going to be coronated Democratic nominee [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2072.32s)]
*  without ever once having to undergo a serious challenge [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2076.02s)]
*  on what her stance is on the Israel-Palestine conflict, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2081.78s)]
*  the Gaza war, maybe another war with Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2086.14s)]
*  in the next few weeks, who's to say, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2089.58s)]
*  she just magically bypassed that entire process. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2091.86s)]
*  That's supposed to be one of the main functions [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2095.32s)]
*  of a primary, right? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2097.66s)]
*  That you subject the politician to scrutiny, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2098.72s)]
*  you contrast them and compare them with other candidates. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2101.34s)]
*  We're told that she's perceived as having some difference [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2104.26s)]
*  with Joe Biden, but of course, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2107.34s)]
*  she is a member of the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2109.6200000000003s)]
*  so therefore incurs all that record vis-a-vis the Gaza war. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2111.82s)]
*  And if you believe it's a genocide, right? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2117.86s)]
*  Then Kamala Harris is complicit [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2121.0200000000004s)]
*  in the perpetration of a genocide. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2123.2200000000003s)]
*  Swapping out Joe Biden didn't resolve that quandary, did it? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2125.38s)]
*  So it's just amazing. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2129.48s)]
*  Are you as amazed as I am that Kamala Harris hasn't had [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2132.58s)]
*  to give one foreign policy pledge on a single issue, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2136.1800000000003s)]
*  whether it be Israel, China, Ukraine, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2138.98s)]
*  before she just swoops into the nomination [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2141.62s)]
*  in the New York Times and MSNBC, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2143.66s)]
*  they're all cheering with adulation. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2145.86s)]
*  It doesn't even occur to them [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2149.2200000000003s)]
*  that maybe that would have been a good idea [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2150.1800000000003s)]
*  to get her on the record on at least a couple of issues, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2151.94s)]
*  especially foreign policy or national security, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2154.66s)]
*  where the president has by far [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2157.2200000000003s)]
*  the most unilateral authority. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2158.46s)]
*  So what do you make of that situation? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2161.14s)]
*  Yeah, so no, I'm not surprised. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2164.54s)]
*  So I explained this in Justice is Coming, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2168.18s)]
*  that so we live under corporate rule [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2171.8599999999997s)]
*  and mainstream media is the marketing arm of corporate rule. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2175.22s)]
*  So of course they're not gonna ask [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2179.22s)]
*  the simplest, most basic questions. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2180.8599999999997s)]
*  So Michael, you're bringing up her policy on Israel. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2183.72s)]
*  I'm gonna come back to that in a second, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2186.5s)]
*  but what policies has she explained? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2187.94s)]
*  She hasn't explained any of her policies. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2190.9s)]
*  So for example, in 2020, for a while, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2192.94s)]
*  she was pretending to be for Medicare for All. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2195.26s)]
*  Then she switched it to Medicare for Some. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2197.5s)]
*  So is she for Medicare for Some now? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2201.26s)]
*  Whatever the hell that means, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2203.42s)]
*  Medicare for None, Medicare for All, what's her policy? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2204.54s)]
*  No one even bothers to ask. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2207.96s)]
*  So I could list you a dozen domestic policies [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2210.1s)]
*  and foreign policies that mainstream media [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2212.84s)]
*  hasn't even thought to ask of her [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2215.06s)]
*  because they're like, oh, she's a corporate Democrat. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2217.38s)]
*  Great, wonderful, woohoo, right? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2220.18s)]
*  And that's why they didn't mind [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2222.8199999999997s)]
*  if it was Biden or Kamala Harris [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2224.02s)]
*  because they're like, who cares? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2225.3399999999997s)]
*  They're not in charge anyway. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2226.4199999999996s)]
*  Corporate rule's in charge, status quo's in charge. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2228.3399999999997s)]
*  The donors are in charge. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2230.8599999999997s)]
*  And then now, of course, they're never gonna explain that [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2232.2599999999998s)]
*  to their audience or their viewers or their readers, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2234.58s)]
*  but that's the reality. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2237.06s)]
*  So that's why they're not even bothering. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2238.06s)]
*  Look, I tried to make this system in my own small way [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2239.66s)]
*  as fair as we possibly could be and should have been. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2243.3599999999997s)]
*  So that's why I ran against Biden. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2247.06s)]
*  That's why I asked for an open convention, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2248.58s)]
*  demanded an open convention. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2251.62s)]
*  But by the way, for all these people [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2252.9s)]
*  who think it's such a great idea to not test your candidates, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2255.66s)]
*  you are empirically incorrect. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2258.42s)]
*  In 2016, the Republicans had the most vicious primary [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2260.62s)]
*  I've ever seen, and they won. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2265.34s)]
*  In 2020, the Democrats had a primary with 27 people [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2267.74s)]
*  that was super active and contentious, and they won. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2271.58s)]
*  No, very quickly, as a point of information, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2275.58s)]
*  remember when Howard Dean was the chair [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2278.82s)]
*  of the Democratic National Committee [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2280.38s)]
*  after the 2008 election? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2281.7799999999997s)]
*  And the 2008 primary, the Democratic primary [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2283.58s)]
*  between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2286.18s)]
*  was extremely prolonged. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2287.94s)]
*  And I spoke, I wasn't a journalist at this point, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2289.62s)]
*  I was just hosting Howard Dean to come speak [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2292.3s)]
*  at my college event, but he told me privately [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2295.34s)]
*  that he attributes the reason why Obama went on to win [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2298.42s)]
*  Indiana and North Carolina in the general election in 2008, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2302.74s)]
*  which were staunchly Republican states, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2307.18s)]
*  especially Indiana, that one was a shocker, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2309.66s)]
*  was because that extended primary process [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2312.02s)]
*  forced Democrats to do lots of organizing in states [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2315.58s)]
*  that they otherwise wouldn't devote [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2319.5s)]
*  organizational resources to. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2321.06s)]
*  So that just further bolsters your point [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2323.22s)]
*  about it being the opposite of empirically proven [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2325.7s)]
*  that even a bitter primary were down [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2329.4199999999996s)]
*  to the disadvantage of the eventual nominee. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2332.14s)]
*  So first primaries in Kamala Harris on Israel. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2334.7s)]
*  So on the primaries, look, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2337.78s)]
*  when you have a contested primary, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2340.62s)]
*  you get literally billions of dollars in free media. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2342.06s)]
*  Throwing that away is political malpractice. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2346.5s)]
*  And they say, oh, that's okay, we're gonna throw that away [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2349.26s)]
*  because Democratic leadership is so wise [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2351.66s)]
*  that they're going to anoint a leader, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2355.78s)]
*  and that leader is always going to win. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2358.1s)]
*  So all you have to do as Democratic voters [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2360.62s)]
*  is obey authority figures, which was the whole, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2362.8599999999997s)]
*  like it's exact opposite of what the Democratic Party [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2366.3399999999997s)]
*  was supposed to do, right? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2368.7s)]
*  And those rocket scientists said that Hillary [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2370.42s)]
*  was a guaranteed win in 2016, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2373.42s)]
*  and that Joe Biden was a guaranteed win in 2024. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2375.7799999999997s)]
*  So if you believe those guys, you're a schmuck. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2378.98s)]
*  So no, you should have contested primaries [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2382.2999999999997s)]
*  and pick the strongest candidate. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2385.22s)]
*  That's super obvious unless you're brainwashed [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2387.58s)]
*  by mainstream media and the DNC. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2390.22s)]
*  Now to Kamala Harris's position on Israel, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2392.22s)]
*  it is identical to every politician in America. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2394.74s)]
*  They all have the same exact position, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2398.5s)]
*  which is Israel will get whatever they want. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2401.58s)]
*  We've given them $300 billion [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2404.66s)]
*  because they're our special ally over the years. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2407.3399999999997s)]
*  All right, if they're such a special ally, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2411.14s)]
*  when are they gonna give us the 300 billion back? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2412.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, I see, this special friendship [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2415.2999999999997s)]
*  only goes in one direction, where we start wars for you, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2418.22s)]
*  we give you hundreds of billions of dollars, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2421.3399999999997s)]
*  we let you commit every war crime in the world, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2423.54s)]
*  we protect you in the UN, but is Kamala Harris [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2425.4599999999996s)]
*  different than any other Republican or Democrat? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2428.2999999999997s)]
*  No, they all kiss Israel's ass, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2430.5s)]
*  and they do it because AIPAC funds their elections. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2432.9399999999996s)]
*  Mystery solved. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2435.98s)]
*  Yeah, so Cenk, let's conclude with this. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2438.58s)]
*  I know a couple of months ago, correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2440.58s)]
*  but you went on some kind of hiking excursion [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2443.58s)]
*  out there in LA with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2445.9s)]
*  Is he a viable alternative at this point to you, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2448.78s)]
*  or are you on board with whatever the Democratic Party [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2451.2200000000003s)]
*  barfs out as an alternative to Trump? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2457.06s)]
*  I mean, it seems like this is a climate [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2459.26s)]
*  that really should have been [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2461.42s)]
*  as ripe as ever for a third party. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2463.6600000000003s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has gotten some traction, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2466.58s)]
*  he has identified a certain void in the electorate [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2469.1800000000003s)]
*  for what at least certain elements want, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2473.14s)]
*  who are disillusioned from the two-party system. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2476.7s)]
*  So I guess this is a concluding thought. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2478.62s)]
*  Why is it that he seems to be rising up [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2480.62s)]
*  as a truly viable alternative, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2484.3799999999997s)]
*  at least to the point where you would be more willing [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2485.9s)]
*  to entertain him as somebody to advocate for and to vote for? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2488.3799999999997s)]
*  Why just revert back to the default of whoever [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2492.8599999999997s)]
*  the Democrats deign to beset us with? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2495.58s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a difference on whether I think [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2499.54s)]
*  he's got a shot and whether I think that, you know, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2502.66s)]
*  he should be considered. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2506.82s)]
*  He doesn't have a shot because mainstream media [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2507.94s)]
*  totally assassinated him, right? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2510.1s)]
*  Character assassination, every slight thing in his life. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2511.74s)]
*  Maybe not the greatest part of the year [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2516.74s)]
*  is with respect to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2517.54s)]
*  But I take the point, you meant metaphorically. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2519.1s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2522.14s)]
*  That's why I said character assassination. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2522.98s)]
*  And so look, for example, that the brain worm, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2526.14s)]
*  like he shouldn't have said that even in a divorce [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2530.1s)]
*  deposition many years ago, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2531.98s)]
*  because of course it could be used against you. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2533.2599999999998s)]
*  But it turns out millions upon millions of people [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2535.4199999999996s)]
*  have the same condition. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2539.1s)]
*  Now, did you get that from mainstream media? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2540.94s)]
*  No, you didn't get it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2542.74s)]
*  All you got was, ha ha, crazy guy, brain worm, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2543.66s)]
*  ha ha, not backed by the establishment, right? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2545.7799999999997s)]
*  So I'm not in that camp. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2549.02s)]
*  So we had Bobby Kennedy Jr. on the show on the Young Turks. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2550.22s)]
*  We gave him a super fair hearing. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2554.7799999999997s)]
*  If you watched that interview, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2556.18s)]
*  I think everyone across the political spectrum [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2557.14s)]
*  will think that was fair. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2559.66s)]
*  And so what's my issue? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2561.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of positions he has [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2563.5s)]
*  that I think are actually really great [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2566.9s)]
*  and that nobody talks about. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2568.54s)]
*  And there's a couple of positions he has [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2570.06s)]
*  that are potential deal breakers. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2571.62s)]
*  So look, I believe in vaccines. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2574.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know when it became a populous thing to hate science, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2577.98s)]
*  but I don't hate science. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2581.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't think that Bob on Facebook knows better [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2583.7s)]
*  than 99% of the doctors in the world. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2586.2999999999997s)]
*  So that's tough for me. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2588.8999999999996s)]
*  And I know that his position is a little bit more complicated. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2591.1s)]
*  Actually, Trump's position on vaccines is arguably worse. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2593.4199999999996s)]
*  And then the second problem is Gaza. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2598.3399999999997s)]
*  And I know, yeah, all the politicians are the same. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2599.9399999999996s)]
*  I just said it, but he's just so bad on Israel [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2602.1s)]
*  that they're just the most beautiful moral army [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2606.4199999999996s)]
*  in the world in preposterous statements like that. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2610.14s)]
*  Especially if you're gonna position yourself [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2612.14s)]
*  as opposing the military industrial complex [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2613.7s)]
*  and you're fighting all these establishment interests [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2615.98s)]
*  and yet you're among the most vehement political figures [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2618.2599999999998s)]
*  in the entire country in championing Israel [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2621.2599999999998s)]
*  in its ongoing offensive. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2625.22s)]
*  I mean, that's almost an irreconcilable contradiction. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2626.66s)]
*  Yeah, there is a potential explanation. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2631.9s)]
*  But anyway, so, but like if he meant it [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2633.9s)]
*  on the military industrial complex, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2637.7799999999997s)]
*  he says he'd cut the Pentagon's budget in half. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2639.2599999999998s)]
*  The half that they can't ever seem to find [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2642.5800000000004s)]
*  when they can't pass on it. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2644.86s)]
*  Now that's an unrealistic one. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2647.82s)]
*  I would love it, but it's never gonna happen. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2649.1000000000004s)]
*  But at least if he went in that direction, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2650.6600000000003s)]
*  I would like that. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2652.1400000000003s)]
*  His stance on money and politics is fantastic. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2653.1800000000003s)]
*  He's for a convention, an Article 5 convention [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2656.86s)]
*  to get around Washington [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2660.7000000000003s)]
*  and propose a constitutional amendment [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2663.5800000000004s)]
*  by the American people. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2665.5s)]
*  I love that. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2666.6200000000003s)]
*  That's as populous as it gets. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2667.46s)]
*  It's exactly what a group I founded called Wolf Pack [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2669.06s)]
*  is trying to do. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2672.18s)]
*  It's nonpartisan. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2673.02s)]
*  And then finally, his best policy, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2674.38s)]
*  I mean, money and politics is the most important issue. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2676.38s)]
*  So that's his best policy. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2678.58s)]
*  But one that's not being talked about at all [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2680.42s)]
*  and that's fantastic is his housing policy. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2682.7799999999997s)]
*  He says he would prevent private equity [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2685.7799999999997s)]
*  from buying residential homes. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2687.46s)]
*  Now that is doable. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2689.1s)]
*  They weren't buying residential homes [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2690.58s)]
*  just a couple of years ago. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2691.9s)]
*  They're the ones that have driven up [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2693.2599999999998s)]
*  the housing market prices [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2694.38s)]
*  so that it's unaffordable for the average American. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2695.62s)]
*  And they're the ones choking off wealth creation [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2697.98s)]
*  in this country [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2700.66s)]
*  because we mainly create wealth through purchasing homes. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2701.7000000000003s)]
*  And now the bankers are gonna buy all those homes [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2704.94s)]
*  and drive us out of the market. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2707.18s)]
*  If he prevented that, that alone might be worth it. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2708.58s)]
*  So I've got an open mind [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2711.58s)]
*  and I'm not a robot for mainstream media. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2713.78s)]
*  So I look at his upsides and his downsides [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2716.82s)]
*  as I do with Trump and Kamala Harris. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2718.98s)]
*  And at the end, I'll make a decision [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2721.2200000000003s)]
*  on who I think is the best. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2722.5s)]
*  But right now, his deal breakers [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2723.7000000000003s)]
*  are hugely problematic for me. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2725.98s)]
*  So very likely I'll vote for the Democrat. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2728.86s)]
*  All right, well, Cenk Uygur, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2731.7000000000003s)]
*  we really appreciate you joining us. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2733.5s)]
*  Like I said at the outset, I did in a previous life [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2735.62s)]
*  even work for the Young Turks briefly. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2738.54s)]
*  And I appreciated it largely because [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2740.58s)]
*  you followed through on your pledge to me [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2743.58s)]
*  and gave me the autonomy to do what I wanted to do, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2746.62s)]
*  not withstanding any disagreements [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2750.2200000000003s)]
*  that you and I might have, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2752.06s)]
*  or I might have had with other people who were on the staff. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2753.42s)]
*  And so I respect that you follow through on that promise. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2755.98s)]
*  And I do think that it's an honorable thing, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2759.18s)]
*  especially for somebody who runs a big media organization, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2761.26s)]
*  who could micromanage things, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2764.42s)]
*  who could impose his will on others. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2765.94s)]
*  You were tolerant of disagreements. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2767.98s)]
*  That's a laudable trait. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2770.18s)]
*  And it's one that I even try to embody in my own dealings. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2771.94s)]
*  I'm not running a media organization. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2775.3s)]
*  I'm just filling in Greenwell right now. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2776.7400000000002s)]
*  But at least in spirit, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2778.78s)]
*  it's something that I've definitely tried to replicate. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2779.94s)]
*  So thank you for that. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2782.22s)]
*  And we'll talk again soon. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2783.94s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhukvcaf4g&t=2787.9s)]
