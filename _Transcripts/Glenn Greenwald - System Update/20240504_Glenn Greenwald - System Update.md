# Students Smeared as "Terrorists" to Justify Free Speech Crackdowns
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0)
*  Here is the NYPD video that they created to heap praise on themselves, to treat themselves [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=0.0s)]
*  as some kind of brave, heroic fighting force because they successfully stood down unarmed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=16.04s)]
*  from 19 year old kids at Columbia. And again, you would think that based on this video, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=24.08s)]
*  they had just successfully arrested the leaders of all five families that constitute organized [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=30.959999999999997s)]
*  crime in the United States and at the same time dismantled all of these street gangs [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  that plague New York City and confronted Al-Qaeda and ISIS as well. Listen to how they talk [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=41.36s)]
*  about what they did here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=47.56s)]
*  Here's the chief of the department's conference room. They're showing the planning of this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=51.64s)]
*  incredibly brave operation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=57.0s)]
*  Can you believe they're putting this with melodramatic music as though they're so, such [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=74.0s)]
*  high tension as the good guys are going to confront the dangerous bad guys, the unarmed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=79.39999999999999s)]
*  students at Columbia? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=85.32s)]
*  This is very similar, this picture, like they're in the situation room to the one that the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=97.32s)]
*  Obama White House released where Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Brennan were all [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=102.52s)]
*  watching the Navy SEALs go in, confront and ultimately kill Osama bin Laden. This is the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=108.56s)]
*  kind of ethos, the kind of film spirit that they're trying to copy. And again, the implication [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  is that they're confronting dangerous terrorists rather than who they confronted, which are [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=125.04s)]
*  people who didn't resist, who marched out, who used no weapons, who wield no weapons, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=128.96s)]
*  who didn't even fight the police at all. But this is what the New York City Police Department [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  is trying to imply. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Police officers with all kinds of helmets and military gear and the big truck that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=163.88s)]
*  they're using to go and confront these students to enter this dangerous building. I mean, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=179.04s)]
*  they're really acting like they entered some sort of ISIS camp and took down the world's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=185.56s)]
*  most pardoning, well-armed and dangerous terrorists. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=193.04s)]
*  Oh my God, they have like sleeping bags on the floor they found. These people are monsters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=196.04s)]
*  They're like a minute away from blowing up the entire New York subway system. Can you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=203.04s)]
*  believe the New York City Police Department filmed itself in this incredibly simple rudimentary [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=210.04s)]
*  operation and then produced a propaganda video complete with dangerous music and suspenseful [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=217.04s)]
*  lighting and a narration that suggests that these police officers are not just trying [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=224.04s)]
*  to kill the terrorists, they're trying to kill the terrorists. They're trying to kill [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=231.04s)]
*  the terrorists. They're trying to kill the terrorists. They're trying to kill the terrorists. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=236.04s)]
*  Complete with dangerous music and suspenseful lighting and a narration that suggests that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=241.04s)]
*  these police officers were engaged in one of the most dangerous operations seen in the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=246.64s)]
*  history of the New York City Police Department and yet with great skill and courage, they [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=251.44s)]
*  were able to carry it out and protect the good people of New York City from these terrorists [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=256.68s)]
*  who were occupying this building. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=260.44s)]
*  It's a little bit of a place and when we actually came in here, they actually had the desk barricaded [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=262.44s)]
*  up to the windows. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=269.44s)]
*  Oh wow, they had like school chairs like the kind that you find in nursery school like [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=270.44s)]
*  those little desks, those little chairs with the attached desk, these little wooden desks. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=274.14s)]
*  They piled about eight of them up and put them against the door and yet the New York [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=278.64s)]
*  City Police Department was able to overcome that incredibly sophisticated show of resistance [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=282.94s)]
*  and force to try and stop them. They didn't blink. They stared down these wooden chairs. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=289.94s)]
*  They got through the wooden chairs. They put those sleeping bags that they found and they [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=295.08s)]
*  collected them and they did not allow them to remain on the floor. Courage like that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=299.52s)]
*  is unfathomable. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=305.52s)]
*  Oh wow, he feels totally safe with like a thousand heavily armed police officers. He [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=306.52s)]
*  feels totally safe with police officers equipped with paramilitary gear and night vision and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=330.52s)]
*  goggles and massive guns. He feels totally safe because they're such professionals even [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=333.82s)]
*  though they're facing down about a hundred unarmed college kids. He's not scared at all. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=341.32s)]
*  They're showing themselves removing those school chairs and then they're going in with [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=350.52s)]
*  shields and there's hundreds of them and they're taking out college students in handcuffs. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=363.52s)]
*  There's more scenery of the wooden chairs, the wooden school chairs. There's like a stroller [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=372.52s)]
*  there. Oh, there's a broken window. So this is the mindset. It's very much the mindset. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=378.52s)]
*  All of this is about continuously escalating the level of fear to make you think that basically [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=387.52s)]
*  there are al-Qaeda sleeping cells occupying every American campus. And it's not just rhetoric, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=393.52s)]
*  it's being accompanied with all kinds of action. Now, watching Fox News ever since October [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=399.52s)]
*  7th, I've been talking about this for a long time. And just as a reminder, the first show [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=405.52s)]
*  that we did after October 7th was that Monday, October 9th. And I began the show by talking [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=410.52s)]
*  about the dangers of 9-11 and the way in which people might react to a terrorist attack and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=416.52s)]
*  completely lose their minds, lose any sense of proportionality. And then, you know, the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=423.52s)]
*  United States, in addition to suppressing all kinds of civil liberties, went on a spree of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=429.52s)]
*  invasions and bombing campaigns that lasted more than a decade over a single day attack. And it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=434.52s)]
*  was very predictable that the same thing was going to happen here. And that's why after October 9th, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=441.52s)]
*  when I explained why I thought what Hamas did was unjustifiable, I proceeded to urge that people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=445.52s)]
*  remember the lessons of 9-11. And yet, from the beginning, starting on October 7th, watching Fox [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=450.52s)]
*  News reminded me, it was like watching Fox News on October 13th, 2001. And throughout 2002 and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=456.52s)]
*  2003, they were speaking of these protesters that were scorned and contempt the way they did the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=465.52s)]
*  protesters who were trying to stop the invasion of Iraq while the Fox News company and every one of [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=470.52s)]
*  its personalities was cheering that war and demanding that war, a war that turned out to be a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=477.52s)]
*  bloody disaster for everyone in that region, for the United States, for our military who lost their [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=481.52s)]
*  lives there over nothing. And Fox News is just right back to doing what they're doing. Listen to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=487.52s)]
*  the tenor of their coverage. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=494.52s)]
*  But beyond that, are you worried that we could see these scenes being used as an opportunity for a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=496.52s)]
*  terror attack? You know, I'm not saying it's going to happen in the next 45 minutes while we're on [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=503.52s)]
*  air, but let's say it's another day of this tomorrow because the powers that be have let this thing [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=508.52s)]
*  foam in. Could you see a lone wolf or an organized group or something seizing on this moment to create [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=513.52s)]
*  a terror attack or, if not that, just to use this as a dry run for one in the future? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=519.52s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. I think when you see these crowds and everything that's going on and based on what was [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=526.52s)]
*  happening in New York, they probably have made some plans altering what they're looking at doing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=532.52s)]
*  So you always have that and then you always have the lone wolf actor that may take the opportunity that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=537.52s)]
*  just gets into this and then it is his or her opportunity to do something that they want to personally [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=544.52s)]
*  get that response from. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=551.52s)]
*  That's...I mean, they were looking at this student protest at UCLA and the only violence at this protest [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=553.52s)]
*  ended up being the following day when a bunch of pro-Israel counter demonstrators showed up and began [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=562.52s)]
*  trying to dismantle the encampment, throwing metal barriers and blockades at the protesters, throwing [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=567.52s)]
*  chemical weapons into them like tear gas and the like, pepper spray. There were protesters that were [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=573.52s)]
*  injured, pro-Palestinian protesters that ended up being the only real violence at any of these protests [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=582.52s)]
*  and yet Fox News looked at this protest and said, should we expect a terrorist attack to emerge out of this? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=587.52s)]
*  Here from the free press, which is Barry Weiss's site, and Barry Weiss of course is one of the most [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=595.52s)]
*  fanatical supporters of Israel that the country knows right next to Ben Shapiro. I mean, it shapes and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=602.52s)]
*  defines everything she does and says. From Francesca Block, the title was, quote, the micro intifada, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=607.52s)]
*  how American protesters are being trained in militancy. Quote, guides created by radical groups are [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=616.52s)]
*  teaching pro-Palestinian students to use violence on campus. Instructions show how to barricade doors [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=623.52s)]
*  with heavy furniture, create a, quote, shield against police using trash cans, ropes, sheets of cardboard [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=630.52s)]
*  or a corrugated metal banner, and to pick locks using a, quote, technique developed by firemen and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=636.52s)]
*  criminals. If these less destructive methods don't work, the guide says, quote, more aggressive options [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=642.52s)]
*  are abundant such as using a crowbar to open a window. Notice that none of them suggest, let alone [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=648.52s)]
*  encourage, the use of actual violence against protesters. And again, the only violence, the only real violence [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=659.52s)]
*  that we've seen since these protests began was at UCLA when counter demonstrators showed up to support [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=668.52s)]
*  Israel and began physically attacking the pro-Palestinian protesters who were there. And the tenor of this [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=674.52s)]
*  media coverage constantly is hysteria. Hysteria, it is unhinged beyond belief. Depicting these people who are [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=681.52s)]
*  protesting a war as starting a violent intifada, as being part of Hamas, part of terrorist organizations. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=690.52s)]
*  This is the environment, the fear-mongering environment that has ushered in all of these government measures. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=702.52s)]
*  This is the framework, the groundwork that you need to lay. Here is Warah Ingram who decided to invite on a [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=710.52s)]
*  student at North Carolina because the students at North Carolina became heroes of the American right and the [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=719.52s)]
*  pro-Israel wing of the Democratic party because protestors had raised a flag of Gaza and they took the flag of Gaza [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=725.52s)]
*  down and put the American flag up and they were depicted, oh look, these are the patriots we love. And so Warah [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=734.52s)]
*  Ingram had on one of these great American patriots there to defend the American flag, only the problem was he [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=739.52s)]
*  wasn't there to defend the American flag as he says himself, he was there to defend the Israeli flag. Here's what he told her. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=746.52s)]
*  Isaac Mala, Isaac, what motivated you to defend the flag? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=753.52s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all, thanks for having me on. I really appreciate it. And I'll say when we talk about motivation for the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=758.52s)]
*  flag, the primary reason I was on that call right before this ever even began to become an American issue, I was on there [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=764.52s)]
*  because I'm Jewish and I'm Orthodox and a lot of members that were holding up that flag were. And so we were there really just [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=770.52s)]
*  kind of holding up our Israeli flags and trying to stop hate and there's been a lot of anti-Semitism around the country. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=778.52s)]
*  So we were there first and foremost for our country of Israel. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=784.52s)]
*  These were the people who were depicted as the American patriots we all admire and love so much, these great devotees to the United [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sdrMUm0zm0&t=788.52s)]
