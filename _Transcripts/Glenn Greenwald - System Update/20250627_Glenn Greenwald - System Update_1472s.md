# Trump at the NATO Summit: Key Takeaways from The Hague
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw)
*  Hello, everybody. It's Michael Tracy. I am here in the Netherlands for the annual NATO [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=0.0s)]
*  Summit. That's right. I, Michael Tracy, was admitted to attend and cover this year's annual [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  NATO Summit in The Hague of all places after having been rejected from attending last year [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=23.6s)]
*  when the NATO Summit was held in my home country of the United States, namely in Washington, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=33.04s)]
*  D.C. They didn't let me into that one. They didn't let me into the one the year prior, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=39.6s)]
*  which was in Lithuania. They did let me into the one the year prior to that, which was in Spain. So [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=43.36s)]
*  who knows exactly what the calculus is here. There's maybe some inside baseball that explains [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=49.28s)]
*  some of it that I'll share at a later date. But for now, I wanted to give you a couple of highlights [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=55.84s)]
*  of my initial forays into this year's NATO Summit. As I record this, I'm about to head out [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  for the second day of the festivities, which includes the big parliamentary style meeting [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  of all the NATO member states. Trump is here. He, we're told, I'm not sure if this is true, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=81.12s)]
*  but it's amusing. Regardless, supposedly he slept overnight at the King's residence or something. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=86.0s)]
*  Well, don't hold me to that one. But yeah, there's a lot going on today, so I'll be heading out. But [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=92.4s)]
*  I wanted to give a couple of highlights of the first day. And so obviously one of the big topics [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=98.96s)]
*  on everybody's mind, understandably enough, is the fact that the U.S. just bombed Iran, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  that Israel launched a preemptive strike, as they called it, on June 12th, with the U.S. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  aiding and abetting Israel as usual, with overwhelming levels of coordination and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=122.16s)]
*  intelligence and arm supplies. And then, as we all know, that culminated in Trump bombing Iran [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=129.12s)]
*  over the weekend. And now we have what is tentatively, tentatively looking like some [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=136.4s)]
*  sort of a ceasefire, although it's hard to really know, given how overwhelming of a deluge [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=144.88s)]
*  of genuine disinformation there has been over the past two weeks about the nature of this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=150.88s)]
*  operation vis-à-vis Iran. But anyway, one of the things that I think is worth exploring [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=154.96s)]
*  about this development with respect to the NATO summit is how do the NATO member states square [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=164.0s)]
*  their constant vigorous denunciations of Russia for, they claim, violating international law, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=176.88s)]
*  violating international norms, violating the so-called rules-based order with the invasion [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=184.56s)]
*  of Ukraine, which is fair enough if you want to make that argument. However, if over and over [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=189.44s)]
*  again it's shown indisputably to never be applied with any degree of consistency, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=194.24s)]
*  then it stands to reason that such rhetoric will probably ring hollow over time. And so I asked [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=202.16s)]
*  yesterday the prime minister of Sweden about this very topic. And one thing to bear in mind as you [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=211.12s)]
*  listen to this is obviously like essentially one of the foremost priorities for every [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  European state is to bend over backwards to not do anything that conceivably antagonize Trump, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=229.04s)]
*  right? So they're all banding together to declare that they will achieve 5% [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=236.16s)]
*  of their national spending, GDP, on defense or military spending at the urging and demand of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=244.56s)]
*  Trump. And so now that he's bombed Iran, none of these NATO member states are likely to come out [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=252.24s)]
*  and condemn Trump for doing so, even if at the expense of the United States. And so I think [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=260.48s)]
*  none of these NATO member states are likely to come out and condemn Trump for doing so, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=268.0s)]
*  even if at the same time they go around preening about the supposed sanctity of international [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=273.52s)]
*  law and norms. So here's my exchange with the prime minister of Sweden yesterday. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=280.64s)]
*  Prime Minister, do you regard the U.S. bombings on Iran over the weekend as consistent with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=286.0s)]
*  international law or the Israeli preemptive strike against Iran that then escalated into [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=293.52s)]
*  a large-scale bombing campaign that's consistent with international law? And how does that square [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  with NATO's standing to condemn Russia as violating international law if the largest [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  power in the bloc is committing such an act? Well, I will not be the judge on that. I think I [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  will stick to what I've said previously that there are a few core aspects here. One core aspect is, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=321.04s)]
*  of course, that Iran should not be able to develop nuclear weapons. That is a core international [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  interest. It's of existential importance to Israel, but it's also very, very central, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=335.04s)]
*  of central importance also to other countries. That is one thing. The other thing is, of course, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  the sooner you can get back to more peaceful forms of negotiation, the better it is. And I think we [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=348.08s)]
*  might be heading in that direction. So do you support the U.S. bombing Iran? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=355.68s)]
*  I'm just saying that I think every conclusion right now, every kind of very firm, decisive [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=361.68s)]
*  conclusion right now on what's going to happen is premature. So I say that it is of vital interest [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=367.12s)]
*  to stop the Iranian nuclear developments. And it is, of course, also much better if we can de-escalate [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=374.48s)]
*  and if we can avoid further military developments. Yes, so the Prime Minister's name is Ulf [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=382.48s)]
*  Kristersson. I should have probably mentioned that. And you notice he's hemming and hawing. He's not [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=391.36s)]
*  really giving a straight answer, which is basically what you would expect. But I think it's still [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=397.04s)]
*  illustrative that a prime minister from a country like Sweden, which just joined [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=401.84s)]
*  formally the NATO alliance last year, is now in a position where despite its lineage, meaning this, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=408.88s)]
*  the country of Sweden's lineage of being like an international mediator or peacemaker, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  had been neutral officially on a military level for hundreds of years, going back to the literal [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  era of Napoleon. Now it's joining NATO and the prime minister is in a position where he has to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=431.84s)]
*  engage in mental gymnastics to rationalize or at least implicitly validate Trump bombing Iran on [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  absurd pretenses, apparently putting a premium on Israeli intelligence [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=452.8s)]
*  as the predicate for the strike on Iran. Because remember, it was reported in the New York Times [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=465.44000000000005s)]
*  and elsewhere that the administration suddenly insisting that Iran was, quote, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  weeks away from potentially acquiring a nuclear weapon was a product of Israeli intelligence [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=477.92s)]
*  or Mossad intelligence that had been filtered through to the United States and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=486.0s)]
*  contradicted much of the U.S. intelligence that had come out. You know, infamously, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=492.56s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard testified at her Senate hearing in March to present her national intelligence estimate [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  and flatly contradicted these subsequent appraisals of the intelligence with respect to Iran. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=508.16s)]
*  But then even she decided to, you know, to be a good team player and put out a tweet last Friday [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=519.36s)]
*  echoing the Israeli intelligence that contradicted her own American intelligence [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=528.0s)]
*  assessment from just a few months prior in which she said that they had not found Iran to be [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=532.0s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. And so that's something that also has been coming up at this NATO [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=538.0s)]
*  summit, or at least I've been bringing it up, which is what does it say about the nature of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=546.4799999999999s)]
*  the U.S.-Israeli relationship that intelligence which, again, flatly contradicts the United States [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=551.12s)]
*  is own intelligence is being used as the justification or pretext for an unprecedented [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=564.0s)]
*  American strike on Iran. And I was able to ask Senator Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  who's, I believe, only one of two senators who is here. The American delegation, as far as I've been [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=582.0s)]
*  able to tell, is somewhat smaller than it's been in the past, though maybe I haven't seen everything, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=588.4s)]
*  but like based on what I've known and observed so far, it's only Senator Chris Coons and Senator [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=594.72s)]
*  Gene Shaheen of New Hampshire, both Democrats. And they were both at a big, chummy, politico [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=599.84s)]
*  happy hour function last night that I was also at, which I'll cover in greater depth someplace else. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=611.76s)]
*  But for now, here's my exchange with Chris Coons. In terms of the Iran action, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=619.12s)]
*  there have been reports that the predicate for the Trump administration's strike relied more on [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=626.0s)]
*  an Israeli intelligence assessment that claimed that Iran was within weeks of acquiring a nuclear [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=633.36s)]
*  weapon that may well contradict the U.S. intelligence estimate, as I'm sure you know with DNI Gabbard. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  Public exchange between the president and his characterization of his own [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=645.92s)]
*  direction of national intelligence as being dead wrong suggests that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=650.24s)]
*  So would it be valid to use Israeli intelligence as a predicate for such an action, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=654.16s)]
*  even if it might contradict U.S. intelligence? Is there anything inherently wrong with that? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  A president should rely principally on American intelligence and an analysis delivered to him by [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=665.76s)]
*  the American intelligence community and the joint chiefs and his military advisors. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  I think routinely, historically, the American intelligence community has [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  integrated input from partners and allies around the world in their analysis. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=684.32s)]
*  But if the president made a decision to carry out a military strike principally based on Prime [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=690.48s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu and whatever was conveyed to him by Israeli intelligence, if that contradicted [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=696.96s)]
*  directly the advice he got from the American intelligence community and his military advisors, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=704.64s)]
*  that'd be concerning. But I don't know that, and I don't know these details. This is all a conjecture. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=711.2s)]
*  If that were the case, what would that tell you about the nature of the U.S.-Israeli relationship? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=716.08s)]
*  Obviously, you're a strong supporter of Israel. However, has it gotten exceptionally close to the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  point where now that provokes some worry in terms of outsourcing something as vital as a [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=725.2s)]
*  pre-war intelligence assessment to a foreign nation? Well, the president's responsible for [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=730.0s)]
*  his decisions. And the fact pattern in which this becomes more concerning is the Iranians claim that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=735.6s)]
*  they relocated fissile material before the strikes on Fordow and Isfahan, which raises the very low [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  possibility that Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence might in the future say, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=751.36s)]
*  Everybody back in the bus, please. Everybody back in the bus, please. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=757.36s)]
*  We have found them. Here they are. Now you need to take another strike at this site, which we've just [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=761.6s)]
*  uncovered. So as you might have heard there, I was in a sort of strange situation when that interview [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=766.32s)]
*  was going on. Funnily enough, I arrived yesterday on one of the White House press corps's [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=773.52s)]
*  chartered buses because part of the press [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=781.76s)]
*  affairs here are being handled, at least from the American standpoint, and in terms of like how I'm [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=789.36s)]
*  managing this, the situation is being handled by in part the White House press operation. And so they [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=794.16s)]
*  took us on a bus to the NATO summit yesterday from the hotel that we're staying at. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  And they brought us through to the incorrect entrance. So we were delayed from getting in [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=807.28s)]
*  by about two hours, because initially they brought us to the main like delegate entrance, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=813.4399999999999s)]
*  which is where Chris Coons and Jean Shaheen happened to be. And they let us off the bus. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=817.52s)]
*  And I just figured that I would go up and get a quick interview in with Senator Coons there. And [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  all of a sudden we were being corralled back into the bus and banished and told to go find our [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=829.44s)]
*  media entrance, which was a logistical hassle to even figure out how to get through. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=839.6s)]
*  So that's one of my little, maybe not that interesting, anecdotes, but one that I figured [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  I would share anyway, because hey, why the hell not? Finally, and there's so much more material [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=853.84s)]
*  that I'm going to be coming out with in various capacities, but just wanted to give you and Glenn [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  and all the viewers a little bit of a taste of the highlights from just the first day. I remember [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=868.0s)]
*  the second day has yet to start, at least as I'm recording this. Another interesting thing that [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=873.12s)]
*  happened is there was a press briefing held with a NATO official and we were instructed, demanded, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=880.88s)]
*  required without even asking our consent in advance that by attending this press briefing, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=890.48s)]
*  we were not to refer by name to this NATO official. We were instructed that he can only be [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=898.48s)]
*  referred to as a senior NATO official. Well, I haven't really been able to give it enough thought [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=905.76s)]
*  to conclude one way or another whether I'm going to uphold that dictate that was just handed down [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=912.56s)]
*  to me or imposed on me without my even being consulted in advance, but at least for now, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=918.24s)]
*  I'll give you the disembodied voice of this person who was a NATO official who was holding a press [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=924.56s)]
*  briefing. And just as a little bit of context for the question that I ended up asking, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=930.0s)]
*  it was much different, radically different from any other questions that were asked within this [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=936.4s)]
*  NATO press briefing room as I guess would be expected given that you're plopping me in the [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=941.28s)]
*  middle of all these people and I don't really have the same mentality as to the everlasting [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  virtue of NATO or the unquestioned moral supremacy of everything that's going on here. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=952.64s)]
*  Um, so, you know, most of the questions were basically just the standard thing of asking how [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  Ukraine can be more fulsomely supported with arms provision or like how do we get them more ammunition [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=970.0s)]
*  and all this stuff. And this person, this NATO official made a point to give a elaborate assessment [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  or estimate of Russian casualties thus far and maybe the estimates are right, maybe they're not, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=986.4s)]
*  I don't know for sure. Nobody really does because it's a fog of war. Um, but I noticed that he said [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=994.48s)]
*  nothing at all about the Ukrainian casualties. So he gave an estimated figure for the number of [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1001.84s)]
*  Russian casualties over the course of 2025. So I simply asked, okay, can you give us the equivalent [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1006.0s)]
*  Ukrainian figure? And as you'll hear, he doesn't answer the question because he says he would have [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1012.64s)]
*  to defer to the Ukrainian authorities on that matter. So NATO is admitting that at least in [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1021.76s)]
*  their public facing communications, they are not going to make any independent assessment [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1026.8s)]
*  of Ukrainian casualty figures. Even at this stage of the war, we're over three years now and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1032.8s)]
*  and untold resources expended on the conflict from these NATO member states, not least the US. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1039.76s)]
*  And still they are like on principle refusing to offer any independent assessment of the rates of [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1049.76s)]
*  Ukrainian casualties. Only the Russian casualties are what they'll inform us about, not the Ukrainian. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1057.84s)]
*  So you'll hear that and you'll hear a few other interesting [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1062.64s)]
*  exchanges, I think. So here is me with the vaunted senior NATO official. Here you go. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1069.44s)]
*  Hi, since you've given estimates for Russian casualties over the course of 2025, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1076.96s)]
*  what is the estimate for Ukrainian casualties over that equivalent time frame and in general? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1084.96s)]
*  You mentioned the pause on US intelligence sharing from March. What were the impacts of that pause [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1092.3200000000002s)]
*  while it was underway? And finally, in terms of these increasingly audacious, long-range Ukrainian [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1100.72s)]
*  drone attacks, to what extent does NATO play any kind of supplementary role [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1110.96s)]
*  in enabling Ukraine to carry out those longer and longer-range attacks? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1119.12s)]
*  So first, let me start at the end there. NATO is not a party at this conflict. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1127.04s)]
*  And so when it comes to NATO, some allies are providing assistance to Ukraine in terms of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1134.72s)]
*  material and intelligence and other things like that, but NATO itself is not playing any enabling [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1144.8s)]
*  role in the conflict. On Ukrainian casualties, generally speaking, I'll leave that to Ukrainian [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1156.56s)]
*  colleagues to answer, but President Zelensky, as earlier this year, talked about 46,000 Ukrainian [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1163.84s)]
*  soldiers have been killed, 380,000 have been wounded. He previously mentioned that Ukraine [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1171.84s)]
*  sees at least 50 to 100 combat losses a day. And UNHCR has said that over 40,000 Ukrainian [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1176.9599999999998s)]
*  civilians, civilian casualties have occurred, about 13,000 dead. The real number is probably [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1185.28s)]
*  higher than that. And recent months have shown some of the highest numbers due to the deliberate [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1191.36s)]
*  drone and glide bomb strikes on populated areas that Russia has been carrying out. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1197.52s)]
*  On the impact of the pause of U.S. intelligence, I think it is probably best to leave that to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1203.68s)]
*  Ukraine to describe as well. I mean, there were, I think as we all know, it wasn't a complete and [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1209.84s)]
*  total shutdown, and so certain defensive things were still enabled. So I think I would leave it [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1217.84s)]
*  to Ukraine to further describe that. So you'll notice I also ask about these recent [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1225.36s)]
*  longer and longer-range strikes that Ukraine has been perpetrating deep inside Russia, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1234.3999999999999s)]
*  hitting strategic nuclear bases most infamously in the past month. And you would think, given the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1241.76s)]
*  elaborate interconnection between NATO and Ukraine, that there could be some potential [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1252.24s)]
*  intelligence sharing that might have gone into Ukraine marshaling the resources to conduct that [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1259.2s)]
*  operation. But according to this person, they still are sticking by the talking point that [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1265.44s)]
*  NATO is not, in fact, party to the war, which is kind of an amazing thing to still be claiming. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1271.6s)]
*  And then I also asked him about the—what did I ask him here? I'm trying to refresh my memory [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1279.68s)]
*  because I'm in a bit of a manic haze—oh, about the American intelligence pause. So you'll recall [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1288.96s)]
*  in early March, after Zelensky's meltdown meeting with Trump in the Oval Office, there was what was [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1298.16s)]
*  referred to as a pause or a suspension of U.S. arms and intelligence support for Ukraine. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1306.96s)]
*  It wasn't a full pause. I think he mentioned there were still some, let's say, defensive capabilities [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1315.92s)]
*  and intelligence sharing that was active at that point. But it'd still be interesting to know [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1321.2800000000002s)]
*  what the impacts of that—I think it was nine-day pause—were in real time operationally. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1327.7600000000002s)]
*  You still don't have a clear picture of that. Now, the Trump administration later rescinded that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1333.28s)]
*  pause, and U.S. arms provision to Ukraine continued at roughly comparable rates as they had been [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1338.32s)]
*  flowing during the Biden administration. But it is still a curiosity as to what impact that [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  temporary pause really had. But yet again, this NATO official says, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1355.76s)]
*  somehow I'm the only one who comes up with questions that he can't answer [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1363.92s)]
*  out of deference to Ukraine. Everything else that he was asked by the journalists at that meeting, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1368.08s)]
*  he was more than happy to answer because it was like, oh, how many drones do you think that Russia [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1374.64s)]
*  could produce per day if it continues at the current level of manufacturing capacity? Well, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1382.72s)]
*  that kind of thing. He had no issue answering that, even with speculative answers. But my questions, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1388.4s)]
*  he had to politely defer to some unknown Ukrainian authority who wasn't there, who wasn't accessible, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1396.56s)]
*  etc. So those are just some highlights from today's or yesterday's session. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1403.1200000000001s)]
*  And I have more, hopefully in the coming days. So stay tuned. You can go to my website, mtracy.net [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1412.72s)]
*  for more information as it comes in. And I'm sure also some of that will be broadcast here on System [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1421.76s)]
*  Updates. So it's a grand old time here in the Netherlands. Very fitting that we're in The Hague. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1432.56s)]
*  That's where we all belong. So with that, I will see you later. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1438.4s)]
*  All the information you need is linked below. We hope to see you there. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2v70iUejuw&t=1468.4s)]
