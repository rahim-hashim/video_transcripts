# Pentagon CHAOS?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0)
*  And all this leads to this very strange undermining of Pete Hegseth who as all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=0.0s)]
*  reporting has suggested my own conversations also confirm is absolutely [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=13.56s)]
*  with JD Vance and Steve Witkoff on the side of restraint and Hegseth has been a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=17.92s)]
*  target of establishment forces in Washington from the time that he was [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=26.56s)]
*  nominated. Trump used a lot of capital to get him into that position not because [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=31.16s)]
*  he's some sort of foreign policy dissenter. He has not been in the past [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=36.28s)]
*  quite the opposite but his loyalty now is to Trump and he has been siding with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=41.92s)]
*  the America first foreign policy for the most part. He was obviously a big [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=47.76s)]
*  advocate of bombing Yemen and a lot of opposition to that but when it comes to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=50.72s)]
*  Iran he has been perceived as an impediment and the people closest to him [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=56.8s)]
*  are now being targeted and the Wall Street Journal always the voice of the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=61.92s)]
*  GOP establishment not just when it comes to economic policy and neoliberalism [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=65.12s)]
*  but also to GOP militarism is very excited by exploiting the Pete Hegseth [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=69.52s)]
*  problem in order to do the following this is their editorial from today [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  called the Hegseth Pentagon Chronicles quote no doubt the Moutway press would [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=77.76s)]
*  love to knock Pete Hegseth out as defense secretary but that doesn't come [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  close to explaining the mess at the Pentagon. The staff infighting dismissals [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  and leaks over signal app chats look to be a self-inflicted mistake of a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=92.0s)]
*  management neophyte. If Mr. Hegseth is wise here's what the Wall Street Journal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=96.04s)]
*  says he should do he'll use the staff shakeup to hire some loyal grown-ups who [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=103.04s)]
*  know the building instead of self-promoting isolationist he brought [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=108.64s)]
*  in look at that formulation. Hegseth hired a bunch of people who are become [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=113.12s)]
*  extremely skeptical of US foreign policy especially the idea of endless war in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=119.92s)]
*  the Middle East of war with Iran and Wall Street Journal is saying look we've [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=125.64000000000001s)]
*  stripped you of all your advisors now it's the time to get ordinary [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=130.84s)]
*  establishment militarists surrounding you as opposed to these war skeptics [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=134.68s)]
*  that you hired to be your closest of buyers that advisors that are now gone. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=140.36s)]
*  One of the people who was Hegseth's closest advisor who was the target and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=145.24s)]
*  kind of the fallout of this firing he was escorted out of the office last week [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=153.52s)]
*  under very strange circumstances is Dan Caldwell a former Marine who has fought [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=157.16s)]
*  in wars and has that sort of skepticism about these wars from having fought in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=164.16s)]
*  them that I've seen in many other people like him. Tulsi Gabbard has similar [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=168.6s)]
*  skepticism about regime change wars after having gotten thought in Afghanistan [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=173.68s)]
*  and Iraq lots of other people like that as well and Dan Caldwell was interviewed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=177.24s)]
*  today on Tucker Carlson. It's a 90 minute discussion you can find it on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=184.4s)]
*  Tucker show. It is about the dangers of US military conflict with Iran the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=189.4s)]
*  multifaceted dangers the bipartisan and multi-level pressures being applied to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=196.36s)]
*  the Trump administration to pursue a war with Iran notwithstanding the fact that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=203.56s)]
*  there are no American interests there and Dan Caldwell has an excellent grasp [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=208.08s)]
*  on the history of US foreign policy he's a young guy he is not part of this kind [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=213.44s)]
*  of Republican militarism machine talks about how there's been this very clear [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=218.04s)]
*  breakdown in left versus right when it comes to militarism and interventionism [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=224.2s)]
*  you find a lot of opposition to a war with Iran in the left and also the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=228.44s)]
*  populace right and those are the people who are being systematically targeted [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=232.04s)]
*  now within the Trump administration hoping to amplify the voices of people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=235.56s)]
*  like Marco Rubio and Mike Walton these other traditional neocons that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  populate the Trump administration and I cannot recommend enough listening to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=242.48s)]
*  Dan Caldwell speak to Tucker for 90 minutes about what he thinks what he [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=247.28s)]
*  learned from his short time in the Pentagon but also the broader [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  experiences and foreign policy theories that have led him to this skepticism [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  that has made him a threat to a lot of people in Washington now just want to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  conclude I want to bring on Lee Fung in just a second one of the points Dan [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=268.84s)]
*  Caldwell made is that Trump absolutely is committed to the diplomatic resolution [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=274.23999999999995s)]
*  he does not want to cast aside the possibility of a diplomacy in pursuit of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=279.56s)]
*  war even though people like Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham all the usual [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=286.08s)]
*  suspects Mike Wallace, Marco Rubio are encouraging that he's saying I think we [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  can do a deal that will result in assurances that Iran will not get a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=295.12s)]
*  nuclear weapon and a lot of the hardest-core neocons the most fanatical [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=299.44s)]
*  is real loyalists are going insane because the idea of stopping Iran's [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=304.52s)]
*  nuclear program is the pretext what these people want is a change in the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=311.24s)]
*  regime in Iran they want to go back to installing the Shah of Iran's monarchy [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=316.64s)]
*  that they installed back in 1954 and the Shah of Iran's son thinks he's the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=324.8s)]
*  legitimate ruler of Iran they want to put him back into office Tom Caldwell [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  Dan Caldwell called him the ultimate fail son you may remember the Iraq war [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=336.2s)]
*  the exact same strategies they had a bunch of like Iraqi exiles who had no [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=341.56s)]
*  connection to the Iraqi people hadn't lived there for 40 years people like [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=345.76s)]
*  Ahmed Sharmaldi who was going to float in and govern Iraq once they [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=348.96s)]
*  got rid of Saddam as a US puppet a puppet of neocons a puppet of Israel just like [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  the Shah of Iran was that is still their plan that is the real goal to scare [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=361.12s)]
*  Americans about Iran's nuclear program as a pretext for changing the regime of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=365.32s)]

*  also an attack on Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=424.8s)]
*  because she has been giving intelligence to Trump saying that there's no good [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=428.12s)]

*  the part of neocons to target and coerce Tulsi Gabbard into altering the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=444.8s)]
*  intelligence to say the opposite that Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=450.16s)]
*  be able to justify the war like to cane used to go to the CIA like Paul [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBFUBGt8-E0&t=455.96000000000004s)]
