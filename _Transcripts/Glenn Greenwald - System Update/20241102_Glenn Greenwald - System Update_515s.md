# Darren Beattie Reveals U.S. Role In Lawfare Against Pakistani Leader Imran Khan
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0)
*  Let's get to Pakistan because it's something I've been wanting to talk about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=0.0s)]
*  Just for those people who don't know, Imran Khan was this and is this major celebrity, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=10.56s)]
*  a beloved national figure in Pakistan because he was a huge star in cricket. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  The government of Pakistan has always been very important to the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=22.96s)]
*  It's a nuclear-armed power. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=25.76s)]
*  It's obviously in that region with Afghanistan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=27.0s)]
*  We've cared a lot about who runs that government. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=29.32s)]
*  We usually can control them or at least have pretty close relations with them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=32.04s)]
*  Then suddenly Imran Khan ran for president. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=37.04s)]
*  The country had an outpouring of love and elected him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=39.4s)]
*  Part of what he was doing was declaring independence from the West, from the United States. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=43.4s)]
*  Suddenly he gets charged with lawfare and convicted and removed from the presidency [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=48.68s)]
*  and put in prison. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=52.64s)]
*  Two of my former colleagues at the Intercept, Murtaza Hussain and Ryan Graham, were actually [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  the ones who broke the story based on leaked documents that the CIA gave the green light [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=58.88s)]
*  to and even encouraged the Pakistanis to remove and then imprison him. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=63.88s)]
*  In other words, to implement a coup that got very little attention. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  It was done under the Biden administration. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=74.64s)]
*  I didn't know until recently that this was something that you were so interested in. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  I do remember that when I thought about it that you did interview Imran Khan and you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=82.2s)]
*  made very clear your admiration for him at the time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  This was when he was under house arrest but before he went to prison. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=88.76s)]
*  Tell us what we should know about this and why this has become so interesting to you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=92.4s)]
*  It's a fascinating and very important story with a lot of critical interlinkages to our [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=99.0s)]
*  own situation in the United States. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=103.94s)]
*  It's kind of remarkable. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=106.28s)]
*  My interview with Prime Minister Khan, that was the last Western interview I believe before [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=108.36000000000001s)]
*  he was imprisoned. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=114.04s)]
*  His story is a remarkable one. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=117.04s)]
*  By introduction to the interview I say, kind of tee it up by saying, okay, he was an 80s [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=120.12s)]
*  playboy and celebrity who left all of the glamour and fame to a brutal and difficult [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=126.28s)]
*  life in politics where he challenged two of the most established and corrupt political [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  families in his country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=140.18s)]
*  He won in an astonishing populist upset but the deep state of his regime and the military [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  industrial complex and intelligence community still hated him, did everything they could [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=149.62s)]
*  to get rid of him and ultimately he was put out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  If you hear that initially you're going to think, is he talking about Donald Trump? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=163.54s)]
*  No, it's the story of Khan that has a lot of remarkable parallels and he is absolutely [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=168.06s)]
*  a beloved figure. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=175.5s)]
*  He was pro-Trump. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=177.3s)]
*  The story gets really, there's a lot of interesting intrigue here because the thing that you mentioned [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  of your former colleagues at the Intercept who did a great job on this, there is this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=185.46s)]
*  so-called cipher, this encrypted diplomatic cable whereby shortly after Khan, who had [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=190.54s)]
*  a little visit to Russia that inconveniently coincided with Russia's invasion but he didn't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=197.6s)]
*  know this, this was a pre-planned trip and that kind of became a pretext for the US State [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=203.96s)]
*  Department to say, hey, it would be really great if you got rid of him, reading between [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=211.12s)]
*  the lines something to that effect and literally the next day there was a no confidence vote. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=218.0s)]
*  He was ousted and then based on his defiance to the regime, he was not only ousted but [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=223.96s)]
*  much like Trump, buried in an avalanche of politically motivated charges and unlike Trump [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  thankfully he was imprisoned. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=240.56s)]
*  He's in prison now and part of the urgency of talking about this is that his situation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=243.08s)]
*  has deteriorated dramatically and it's very possible that he could even die in the coming [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=247.8s)]
*  months if something isn't done. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=254.52s)]
*  In my view, he is next to Assange who thankfully is now a free man. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=257.12s)]
*  This is now the number one political prisoner that we should be concerned about and the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=262.88s)]
*  other part of the story that's beyond the parallels with Trump is that he has a lot [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=271.24s)]
*  of the same enemies as Trump does. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=276.88s)]
*  One thing that I've reported on is that the sort of hidden hand behind his ouster was [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=280.48s)]
*  a woman that I'm, thank you and a lot of your viewers are familiar with, someone called [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=287.0s)]
*  Victoria Newland who is a nefarious figure, one of the premier architects of color revolution [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=290.96s)]
*  and regime change operations overseas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=299.44s)]
*  She was instrumental for instance in the Euromaidan and a lot of the operations in Ukraine and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=303.4s)]
*  other Eastern European countries. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=310.12s)]
*  She's deeply connected with that Atlantis-esque, Russia-obsessed faction of the intelligence [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  community that is particularly incensed and combative with Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=318.56s)]
*  She is speaking of the neocons, her husband who recently resigned in disgrace from the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=323.88s)]
*  Washington Post. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  He was pissed off because Bezos dared to say, okay, we're not going to endorse Kamala this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=332.68s)]
*  time and so he resigned in protest. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=338.6s)]
*  Her husband Robert Kagan was one of the architects of the Iraq War and Imran Khan before all [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  of this was very well known as one of the most effective and vocal critics of the Iraq [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  War. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=358.54s)]
*  It just so happens that one of the Iraq War's architects' wives is behind his ouster and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=359.54s)]
*  ultimate imprisonment. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=366.74s)]
*  Of course, Trump in one of his earlier policy statements called out Newland and her nefarious [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=368.82s)]
*  activities by name. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=376.98s)]
*  Newland herself actually resigned in disgrace within the past few months because Biden refused [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=379.98s)]
*  her a key promotion that she was counting on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=388.68s)]
*  So it's very interesting connections here. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  A lot of the same Russia-obsessives, the Atlantis-ists, the color revolution operative, the very people [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=395.72s)]
*  like Victoria Newland were absolutely key to ousting this pro-Trump. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=402.08s)]
*  He got along with Trump great. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=409.5s)]
*  Trump leader was a populist leader who has already aggravated the military-industrial [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=411.88s)]
*  establishment of Pakistan, which that's a whole other story, but the intelligence community [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=420.76s)]
*  of Pakistan is very much connected with our neoconservative establishment because we basically [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=425.76s)]
*  built them up tremendously in the immediate aftermath of 9-11 because of all of the Taliban [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  stuff going on. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=440.08s)]
*  Of course, the Taliban are back to controlling Afghanistan. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=441.28s)]
*  So a lot of good that did us, but that's a short bit of the history. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and bin Laden was hiding pretty securely in Pakistan when we found him near a military [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  base. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=453.0s)]
*  But in any event, Darren, I'd love to have you back on and talk about this a lot more [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=454.0s)]
*  once this election is over. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  You know how it is when there's an election approaching. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  There's not a lot of space to talk about things not directly related to the election. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  Although you make a very good case, one I hadn't previously realized that the situation [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=465.2s)]
*  in Pakistan within Mancun is actually quite relevant to the treatment and reaction to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=470.24s)]
*  Trump here in the United States. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=476.52000000000004s)]
*  So I'd love to explore that more with you in detail. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  Once this election is done, we have the space to do it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  I really appreciate your time coming on. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=484.0s)]
*  Great to be with you as always. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UQKZ7oSl0&t=485.0s)]
