# Upending the “West’s Dictatorship.” New MP George Galloway on the Next Era of Politics
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE)
*  The right honorable George Galloway newly elected member of parliament. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=0.0s)]
*  It is very nice to say that and it's even nicer to speak with you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=11.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us tonight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=15.76s)]
*  This is the Oscars for me being on with Glenn Greenwald. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=19.12s)]
*  But unlike some of the Oscar nominees, I will be speaking out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=22.3s)]
*  Absolutely and with no time limits, with no music cutting you off or anything like that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=26.68s)]
*  Alright, so I'm excited to talk to you for a lot of different reasons. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=30.92s)]
*  One of which is that the trajectory of your political career is so interesting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=34.36s)]
*  It's so rare. This is the third party that you have represented in parliament. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=38.84s)]
*  You were expelled from the Labour Party famously for criticizing Tony Blair in the Iraq War. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=45.32s)]
*  You represented the Respect Party. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  You now have a new party and a new constituency that just elected you by a massive, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=51.92s)]
*  massive mandate. You got more votes than the two major parties combined, Labour and the Conservative Party, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=56.44s)]
*  as well as everybody else running against you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  What do you think really were the main themes that propelled you to, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  I think what was a somewhat improbable victory given the massive establishment forces aligned against you? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, Gaza is obviously the elephant in the room. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=73.24s)]
*  Others don't want to mention it, but I figure there's an elephant in your room. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=77.64s)]
*  It's pretty foolish to pretend it isn't there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=83.64s)]
*  But it isn't just that, actually, because one of the main lessons from our by-election that has been missed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=86.84s)]
*  is that it isn't just me that crushed the big parties of the state, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=94.44s)]
*  but the guy who came second was a local independent, not mentioned in the betting markets, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=99.44s)]
*  not mentioned in a single by-election piece of coverage. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=106.44s)]
*  He came second and well ahead of the mainstream party. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=111.24s)]
*  So between me and an unknown independent, we got almost two thirds of the votes in a national by-election in Britain [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  that was very widely covered. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=125.64s)]
*  I mean, for a by-election, it was very big news indeed when it became clear that I had a shot at winning. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=128.04s)]
*  The cameras descended on us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=135.04s)]
*  We had 30 television crews at the count in Rochdale on election night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=137.44s)]
*  So Gaza was a big issue, but the lack of love for the main parties of the state [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=143.84s)]
*  are responsible for the ground on which this election was fought. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=154.24s)]
*  Nobody loves them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=160.24s)]
*  Anyone who moves for them does so out of interest, not out of love. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=162.44s)]
*  And when there is a chance of voting for someone that comes along with a chance of winning, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=167.64s)]
*  well, the British electorate like to give them a good kick up the two cheeks of the same ass that they represent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=174.44s)]
*  So it's interesting because there is this factor about your constituency, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=183.84s)]
*  which has a heavier Muslim population than most of the constituencies in the UK. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=188.24s)]
*  So I think there are a lot of establishment media outlets and pundits who are trying to dismiss this as an aberration, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  saying that you were able to exploit anger over the UK support for Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=200.44s)]
*  And yet at the same time, as you just pointed out, obviously it does go beyond that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  because there was this independent candidate who got more votes than the conservative and the Labour parties. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=209.24s)]
*  And a big part of your campaign was about things other than Gaza. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=215.04s)]
*  That wasn't just the only issue on which you ran. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=219.44s)]
*  You ran on a wide variety of issues. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  So when you say that there's anger toward the bipartisan establishment, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=224.04s)]
*  very similar to the United States where the Republicans and Democrats pretend to be at each other's throats, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=228.44s)]
*  but in reality have so much in common and people hate them for it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=232.64s)]
*  What are the sources of that dissatisfaction with those establishment parties? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  You're right to make that comparison with the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=242.84s)]
*  As Oscar Wilde said, we are two countries divided by a common language, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=247.04s)]
*  but we are increasingly the same kind of polity with the same lack of care on both sides of the Atlantic [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=251.04s)]
*  for the great majority of the electorate, in fact disdain for the great majority of the electorate, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=260.64s)]
*  who fall outside the Guardian reading liberal intelligentsia, Chatterati, if you like. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=267.24s)]
*  We've got the same thing as you've got in the United States on that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  But the way in which everything has been skewed towards a view, a post-industrial view of Britain [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=279.44s)]
*  where the city of London is the only thing that really matters [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  and inside the beltway Chatterati set the moral parameters, the cultural media parameters. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=295.44s)]
*  This is very widely, deeply felt, keenly felt in the north of England, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=305.44s)]
*  where of course Britain's wealth initially came from, that provided the power, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=311.44s)]
*  the powerhouse of Britain's industrial revolution and its former greatness. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=318.64s)]
*  No one can quite accept that if you don't pass muster with your pronouns with the editor of the Guardian, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=324.44s)]
*  you should be anathematized, you should be black guarded and shunned. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=332.04s)]
*  And that's the feeling people in the north have. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=337.04s)]
*  And the British political parties, I'm the author of the Two Cheeks of the Same Ass Gag, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=340.44s)]
*  but it's funny because everyone knows that it's true. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=347.44s)]
*  And in the past they counted on the fact that there was nobody else to vote for. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=351.44s)]
*  Indeed, Peter Mandelson, known to you and I, said that we don't care about the left, they've got nowhere else to go. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=357.44s)]
*  Well, as it happens, people do have somewhere else to go. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=366.44s)]
*  And when they see laid out for them a path to victory, they take it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=370.44s)]
*  When you first became very well known to Americans, it was 2005 when you had gone to the US Congress voluntarily, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=376.44s)]
*  and I think by all accounts made a very good accounting for yourself. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=385.44s)]
*  In fact, you humiliated a lot of the people on Congress who had spent two years defaming you, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=390.44s)]
*  accusing you of opposing the Iraq War because you were taking money from Saddam Hussein's regime. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=394.44s)]
*  And at the time, and I remember this very well, 2005 was the year I first started writing about politics. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=400.44s)]
*  You were universally described and I think perceived as being a man of the left. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=405.44s)]
*  Now if you go and read British media accounts about your victory, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=410.44s)]
*  all of which, or most of which, in the establishment sector of the media are spewing all kinds of unbridled contempt at you, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=414.44s)]
*  and I want to get to the reasons why in just a minute, but they basically call you anything but that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=421.44s)]
*  They'll use a whole bunch of adjectives for you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=426.44s)]
*  Even some will say that you are now somehow a man of the right, even though as someone who's followed your career, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=428.44s)]
*  I don't really think you've changed your core values in any way. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=434.44s)]
*  And trust me, I empathize very much with this bizarre notion that you suddenly get accused of having turned to a certain direction, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=437.44s)]
*  even though you haven't changed your views. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=445.44s)]
*  Do you still identify as a man of the left, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=447.44s)]
*  or do you think these labels are becoming largely archaic in the wake of our new political debates? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=450.44s)]
*  Well, so much in that question we could spend the rest of the night talking about it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=456.44s)]
*  I still call myself a socialist with a hyphen. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=462.44s)]
*  I'm still a follower of the late and great Mr. Tony Benn, the best prime minister we never had. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=467.44s)]
*  But I really don't like being called of the left anymore, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=474.44s)]
*  because for me the left has become synonymous with liberalism, small l liberalism, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=479.44s)]
*  and I'm actually not all that liberal. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=486.44s)]
*  I treat everyone as they would wish to be treated. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=489.44s)]
*  I was a pioneer, for example. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=493.44s)]
*  I got a Stonewall Award for parliamentary heroism in my stance for the rights of gay people, for example. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=495.44s)]
*  I don't let anyone describe me as any of the isthes and isms that they throw. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=505.44s)]
*  I mean, I get called a racist, even though I've got five mixed-race children, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=512.44s)]
*  and I've represented more people of color in the British Parliament than anyone in history. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=517.44s)]
*  This tendency of liberals who like to think of themselves as the left [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=523.44s)]
*  to call everyone one step to the right of them a fascist, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=530.44s)]
*  to blame anyone who gets their syntax or their pronouns wrong as other kinds of isthes and isms, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=534.44s)]
*  this is the reason why I actually cringe when I am described as left-wing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=544.44s)]
*  I stand for the workers. I'm the leader of the workers' party. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=552.44s)]
*  I fight for the rights of the workers and their families, and I'm content with that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=556.44s)]
*  But what I am is a visceral opponent of bullying, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=563.44s)]
*  whether it is bullying on a domestic scale, a national scale, or an international scale. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=569.44s)]
*  And if I see someone being bullied, I'll run to the side of the victim and stand with them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=576.44s)]
*  So in 2005 with the Iraq War, I think there were some exceptions. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=582.44s)]
*  There were some right-wing voices in the U.S., in the U.K. raising objections to the invasion of Iraq. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=588.44s)]
*  But by and large, you could, I think, create a left-right distinction that was somewhat reliable [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=596.44s)]
*  as an indicator of who was in favor of the war in Iraq and who was against. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=602.44s)]
*  Lots of Democrats, though, were in favor. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=605.44s)]
*  Lots of labor rights, including the leader of your party at the time, Tony Blair, was. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=607.44s)]
*  But you could kind of draw that distinction. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=612.44s)]
*  Since then, you have opposed things like the U.S. and EU wars in Libya, the regime change war in Syria, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=614.44s)]
*  the U.S.-NATO war in Ukraine. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=621.44s)]
*  I think there it's much more difficult to draw this left-right distinction since a lot of the opposition to those wars, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=624.44s)]
*  both in Europe and the U.S., came from both the right and the left. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=629.44s)]
*  You also are a critic of things like mass and uncontrolled immigration, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=633.44s)]
*  and yet at the same time are this steadfast opponent of support for Israel and its destruction of Gaza [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=637.44s)]
*  and the Israeli abuse of Palestinians in general. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=644.44s)]
*  To a lot of people, that may seem like a hodgepodge of issues that are really kind of confused and scrambled, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=648.44s)]
*  and that's why people are confused about your label. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=655.44s)]
*  I'm wondering if you see any throughline, any ideological coherence in what brings you to all of these positions [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=657.44s)]
*  that oppose this kind of neoliberal slash conservative foreign policy [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=665.44s)]
*  and devotion to controlling the world through military force. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=672.44s)]
*  Actually, I'm as constant as the Northern Star. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=675.44s)]
*  I have exactly the same political views I have had in public life for more than half a century, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=679.44s)]
*  and I believe that my views are consistent, one with the other. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=686.44s)]
*  What's happened is there's been a bizarre outbreak of cross-dressing, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=690.44s)]
*  so that the people on the left support the FBI and the CIA and the surveillance state [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=696.44s)]
*  and banning opponents from standing in elections and so on, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=704.44s)]
*  and yet still think that they are the left and still think they have the right to anathematize others [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=709.44s)]
*  and to ontologically miscall them, misgender them if you like, misname them. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=717.44s)]
*  So, you know, I just plow on. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=723.44s)]
*  All my views are consistent. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=727.44s)]
*  Of that, I'm very clear because my views are driven by my conscience, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=729.44s)]
*  which I consider my daily communion with God, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=734.44s)]
*  and if my conscience is telling me that this is the right thing to say and do, I do it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=738.44s)]
*  And I don't think I've been wrong yet. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=745.44s)]
*  Glenn, if I wrote a book, it would be called We Were Right About Everything. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=747.44s)]
*  We were right about Ireland, we were right about Iraq, we were right about Libya, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=751.44s)]
*  we were right about the Ukraine, and so on. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=755.44s)]
*  I don't think I've put a foot wrong. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=758.44s)]
*  It's the others that have done so. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=761.44s)]
*  It's the others who are now dressed in different garb, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=764.44s)]
*  but retaining the right of black-balling people, the right to veto people, and so on. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=768.44s)]
*  So I oppose the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, not because I loved Colonel Gaddafi. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=777.44s)]
*  I never met him, I never loved him. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=783.44s)]
*  But I can never accept an Arab and African country having its regime changed [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=785.44s)]
*  by a motley coalition of Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Sarkozy, and David Cameron. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=793.44s)]
*  I can't accept that colonial powers should be able to push around colonies [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=802.44s)]
*  or even their former colonies. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=809.44s)]
*  I am against mass uncontrolled immigration. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=812.44s)]
*  In fact, only Trotskyites and liberals are in favor of it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=816.44s)]
*  Mass immigration beggars the country from whom the immigrants are coming, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=822.44s)]
*  deprives them of the best and brightest and the most hardworking people in their countries, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=829.44s)]
*  and it drives down wages and living standards, conditions in the countries to which they emigrate. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=837.44s)]
*  That's obvious. I'm the leader of the Workers' Party. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=844.44s)]
*  If I was negotiating with my employer, and my employer could tell me, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=848.44s)]
*  there's 10,000 people standing at the gate ready to take the jobs of your members on less money, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=852.44s)]
*  so you better climb down. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=858.44s)]
*  You don't have to be Maynard Keynes to understand the simple economics of that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=860.44s)]
*  People on the left say, that's because we live in a capitalist society, etc. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=868.44s)]
*  If my aunt had a beard, she'd be my uncle. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=877.44s)]
*  We do live in a capitalist society, and I have to defend my members here and now. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=880.44s)]
*  I have to defend the poor countries who are having their workforce, skilled workforce. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=886.44s)]
*  Where I live, for example, almost all of the National Health Service people have come from Africa and Asia. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=893.44s)]
*  Well, what about the patients in Africa and Asia? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=901.44s)]
*  Why am I being able to enjoy the health care of these health care workers? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=905.44s)]
*  Because there has been this mass uncontrolled immigration. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=911.44s)]
*  So racism is a different matter. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=915.44s)]
*  Once somebody is in here, in this country, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=918.44s)]
*  I will give my life's blood to defend their rights as equals within this society. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=922.44s)]
*  But that doesn't mean I want to abolish borders. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=929.44s)]
*  As I say, only ultra-left and ultra-rich people want to abolish borders. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=932.44s)]
*  In fact, it used to be a long-time cause of the left to oppose open borders. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=941.44s)]
*  When I started writing about politics again in 2005, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=947.44s)]
*  the idea of open borders was considered to be a Koch Brothers plot or a Chamber of Commerce plot, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=949.44s)]
*  an attempt to make sure there's this huge surge of labor supply in order to drive down the wages of national workers. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=955.44s)]
*  This was commonplace left-wing doctrine, and then suddenly it got put through the culture war grinder, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=962.44s)]
*  and now it's viewed solely as whether you're racist or not. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=966.44s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=969.44s)]
*  A lot of people love to claim that they're anti-establishment, that the establishment fears them. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=970.44s)]
*  I don't know of many people who are more hated by the establishment in their country than you. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=976.44s)]
*  And if anybody has any confusion or doubt about that, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=982.44s)]
*  just go pick up any of the mainstream media articles that talk about George Galloway's victory, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=984.44s)]
*  and you will see a kind of vile and invective reserved almost only for people like pedophiles and terrorists, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=989.44s)]
*  and sometimes not even them. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=997.44s)]
*  I mean, you really provoke a lot of rage and anger. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=998.44s)]
*  And one of the things that's amazing to me about that is that pretty much the consensus in the UK now is that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1002.44s)]
*  the Iraq War, which you opposed and they supported, was a monumental disgrace. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1008.44s)]
*  Even Tony Blair says it's what gave rise to the emergence of ISIS, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1013.44s)]
*  that that was the political vacuum that was created that you predicted that they didn't, that gave rise to ISIS. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1017.44s)]
*  When you were elected, the Prime Minister of the UK, the Tory who is almost certainly on his way out, Rishi Sunak, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1024.44s)]
*  convened a press conference almost like it was a national crisis that you had won and declared your victory, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1030.44s)]
*  quote, beyond alarming. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1035.44s)]
*  I'm wondering why it is that you believe that you provoke so much visceral disdain [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1038.44s)]
*  among these guardians of establishment pieties, both in labor and conservative and everything in between. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1045.44s)]
*  What is the real reason you think you do that? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1051.44s)]
*  Well, partly because I'm good at what I do. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1055.44s)]
*  I persuade people. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1058.44s)]
*  I can build things. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1059.44s)]
*  I built my own audience, for example, as many millions per week on my show, which is almost as good as yours. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1061.44s)]
*  And the skills that God gave me, I deploy them and I deploy them fearlessly and consistently. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1069.44s)]
*  I'm not afraid of anyone. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1079.44s)]
*  I don't want anything from anyone. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1081.44s)]
*  And nothing that matters to me can be taken away by anyone. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1083.44s)]
*  So that makes me what Baldwin called the independent man, the man who fears no one and therefore is worth listening to. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1087.44s)]
*  But mainly it's because of the power of example. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1099.44s)]
*  For example, because what if what I did last Thursday is done by scores of people, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1103.44s)]
*  scores of constituencies rather, up and down the country, maybe hundreds. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1110.44s)]
*  We've got 300 parliamentary candidates all ready to pay their own parliamentary election expenses. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1116.44s)]
*  300! We didn't have three five weeks ago. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1124.44s)]
*  What if this is an idea whose time has come? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1129.44s)]
*  What if it bursts the toxic bubble in the beltway in Whitehall and Westminster? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1133.44s)]
*  What if it puts the skids under the prevailing orthodoxy that we have lived under for so very long? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1141.44s)]
*  Dr. Johnson said the grimest dictatorship of them all is the dictatorship of the prevailing orthodoxy. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1150.44s)]
*  And that's the dictatorship we've been living under. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1157.44s)]
*  Sure, there was a bit of lipstick on the pig and a lot of synthetic sound and fury between the two front benches, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1160.44s)]
*  just like, as you describe, happens in America. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1168.44s)]
*  But in truth, you could argue about the color of the walls in the Ministry of Health or a penny or tuppence on or off the income tax. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1172.44s)]
*  But that's all you could argue about. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1182.44s)]
*  The basic givens that Britain will be a neoliberal capitalist country enthralled to the United States [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1184.44s)]
*  and will follow an imperialist foreign policy abroad, these were beyond questioning. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1193.44s)]
*  And anyone who even might be a questioner of those things, like Mr. Corbyn, my parliamentary colleague for many decades, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1201.44s)]
*  he had to be destroyed not because he would have put the income tax up by Tuppence-Hapley instead of Tuppence. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1211.44s)]
*  He might not even have done that, actually, but because he could not be depended upon to support the foreign policy of the United States, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1218.44s)]
*  which is de facto the foreign policy of Britain. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1228.44s)]
*  One of the criticisms is that... [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toB5GZ4bDpE&t=1233.44s)]
