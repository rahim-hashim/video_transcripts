# Glenn Destroys MEDIA LIES: A System Update Retrospective
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA)
*  The New York Times had black voters supporting Trump at 11 percent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=0.0s)]
*  And that was as alarmed as that made the New York Times. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  That was less than a recent poll commissioned by Fox News that among black voters showed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=23.0s)]
*  Biden leading only by 61 to 20 percent. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=30.04s)]
*  That's one out of every five black voters saying they would vote for Donald Trump and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=35.0s)]
*  only 60 percent saying they would vote for Joe Biden. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  Even the 2020 election where there was a slide of black voters to Republicans, that was 91 [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=43.8s)]
*  to 8. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=50.2s)]
*  So we have 61 to 20 now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=51.6s)]
*  Now, one of the most ironic parts about this is that for years, Democratic voters were [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=55.6s)]
*  certain that having more and more non-white voters as part of the American demographic [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=62.6s)]
*  would ensure what they called an emerging and permanent Democratic majority. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  This is the dishonesty at the heart of the claim that Republicans and people like Tucker [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=74.30000000000001s)]
*  Carlson support the idea of the great replacement theory that immigration is importing non-white [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=79.4s)]
*  voters into the United States and changing the demographic to make it less white. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=85.76s)]
*  That is not a claim Tucker Carlson invented or conservatives invented. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=90.7s)]
*  That is a theory that Democratic party strategists have been doubting for a long time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=94.28s)]
*  Here in the Atlantic in 2012, you see the headline, the emerging Democratic majority [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=102.0s)]
*  turns 10, why the new coalition could be here to stay. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=107.24s)]
*  And they were essentially celebrating Obama's victory as a vindication of this thesis. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=111.24s)]
*  Quote, 10 years ago, John Judis and I argued in the emerging Democratic majority that the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=115.24s)]
*  country's shifting demographics were giving rise to a strong new Democratic voting population base. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  The first glimmerings of this emerging Democratic coalition were visible in George McGovern's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=126.74s)]
*  disastrous 1972 campaign we wrote, making the newly emerging majority, quote, George McGovern's revenge. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=131.16s)]
*  In the chapter with that title, we described the strengthening alliance between minorities working in single women, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=138.96s)]
*  the college-educated, and skilled professionals. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=144.16s)]
*  So that was the thesis. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=147.96s)]
*  And here in the American Prospect, which is a very liberal magazine, you see this discussed even more explicitly, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=151.26s)]
*  but it's by the liberal writer, Jameel Bowie, who I previously referenced, who's now at the New York Times. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=159.86s)]
*  It's entitled the Democrats' Demographic Dreams. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=164.46s)]
*  Liberals are counting on population trends to doom Republicans to a long-term minority. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=168.86s)]
*  And he argues they shouldn't. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=174.46s)]
*  Now, he's describing here how it's the view of Democrats, not conservatives, not Tucker Carlson, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  not white supremacists, that one of the benefits of immigration is that it will make the country more non-white and therefore more amenable to the Democratic Party. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=183.26s)]
*  That's their explicit strategy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  And it's unbelievable that if you now point that out or talk about it, you get accused of the great replacement theory, even though it's Democrats who invented it and have been trumpeting it for years. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=196.66s)]
*  Here's what Jameel Bowie wrote in the American Prospect. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=207.96s)]
*  Will be immigrants or the children of immigrants. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=238.06s)]
*  In a little more than 30 years, the U.S. will be a majority minority country, meaning a majority of Americans will be minorities, what are now considered minorities, non-white voters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  By 2050, white Americans will no longer be a solid majority, but the largest plurality at 46%. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  African Americans will drop to 12%, while Asian Americans will make up 8%. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=256.56s)]
*  The number of Latinos will rise to nearly a third of all Americans. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=262.56s)]
*  It's become an article of faith among many progressives that these trends, meaning demographic changes brought about by immigration, set the stage for a new Democratic majority. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=266.06s)]
*  A decade ago, Roy Tishara and John B. Judas popularized this argument in their book, The Emerging Democratic Majority. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=277.86s)]
*  More recently, Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine made a similar case. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=285.46s)]
*  Quote, the modern GOP, the party of Nixon, Reagan and both Bushes is staring down its own demographic extinction, he wrote. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=289.16s)]
*  Conservative America will soon come to be dominated in a semi-permanent fashion by an ascendant Democratic coalition hostile to its outlook and interests. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=296.86s)]
*  That has been the assumption of the Democratic Party forever. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=307.36s)]
*  Non-white voters of their property. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=311.56s)]
*  They automatically receive their vote no matter what. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=314.56s)]
*  And obviously, the key to winning elections into the foreseeable future, Democrats argued, was changing the democratic composition of the United States by making it more non-white through immigration. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=318.46s)]
*  That's the great replacement theory. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=333.85999999999996s)]
*  That's what Democrats have been touting and trumpeting for years. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  I just showed you the proof of that by the authors themselves of that theory, the advocates of it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  What Democrats did not count on, apparently, is that as it turns out, a lot of non-white voters find them repellent. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=345.56s)]
*  The group of Latino voters in particular is close to even now when it comes to Democrats versus Republicans. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=355.06s)]
*  Particularly, they seem to have a lot of affection for Donald Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=365.46s)]
*  Exactly the opposite of what the corporate media thought it was doing when it disseminated all of these race-based trends and narratives about Democrats versus Republicans. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=370.46s)]
*  So Democrats are in a huge amount of trouble, according to these polls. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=381.76s)]
*  And it's not just political trouble, but it's a threat to their core identity of believing that only they believe in a pluralistic society, that only they are the protectors of non-white voters. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=387.46s)]
*  I think non-white voters are hearing this and running in the opposite direction at increasingly large numbers. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  Whatever the reason, that little plan they hatched of staying in power by making America non-white or more non-white, as they put it, is not working because non-white voters are taking more and more looks at them and deciding that the last thing they want to do is keep those people in power. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=408.96s)]
*  Let's dive into this new release of January 6th tapes. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=431.96s)]
*  This was something that a lot of the people who were opposed to Speaker McCarthy were enraged by the fact that he did Kevin McCarthy, under a lot of pressure, release these tapes to Tucker Carlson and Fox to go through and report on, but he never made them all public. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=438.46s)]
*  It was one of the promises they extracted from Mike Johnson when they decided to make him speaker. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=454.46s)]
*  He made good on that promise very quickly, just in the last 48, 72 hours. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=461.46s)]
*  He released a whole bunch of new January 6th tapes that nobody had ever seen before, the first time the public gets to see them all. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=467.46s)]
*  I just want to give viewers who haven't seen it a kind of taste of just one of the videos that shows people coming into the Capitol, not violently, not having to fight their way through, not being stopped by the police, but actually welcomed by the police and marched through the Capitol quite peacefully. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=476.46s)]
*  Let's take a look at this video. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=492.46s)]
*  So you don't really obviously hear any audio, of course, but for people listening by podcast, you have these police officers standing on the side, you have Trump supporters who are marching into the Capitol. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=494.46s)]
*  They're not in any way engaging in any violence, they're not being stopped. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=522.46s)]
*  In fact, the police seem to be shepherding them in, escorting them in, walking them in. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=526.46s)]
*  They're being very peaceful. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=531.46s)]
*  They're walking slowly, walking without having to fight anybody. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=532.46s)]
*  Some of them are just taking videos. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=536.46s)]
*  It's very kind of tranquil scene. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=539.46s)]
*  So Darren, let me ask you about this video and the new videos we've seen. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=541.46s)]
*  Obviously we did learn a lot when Tucker Carlson finally got his hands on them and was able to show us these videos. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=545.46s)]
*  But before we get into the content of them, just talk about the process. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=551.46s)]
*  When the January 6 Committee existed, we saw only the tapes and excerpts that Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and Adam Schiff and Benny Thompson wanted us to see, and they hid everything else. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=554.46s)]
*  What does it say that it took this long, two and a half years almost? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=569.46s)]
*  For almost three full years to be able to have the public see all the videos, not just the videos they wanted us to see. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=573.46s)]
*  Well, there's been a severe reluctance on the part of the mainstream media and the regime to allow the public to see any direct footage of January 6 that could complicate or contradict the official narrative that's been shoved down our throats every day. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=580.46s)]
*  For years now, and that narrative is that January 6 is some sort of horrific, unique event of domestic terror that exceeds even 9-11. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=602.46s)]
*  And I think Biden even said at one point, exceeds the civil war in terms of the trauma that inflicted on the country. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=615.46s)]
*  They've invested a tremendous amount of money and resources and intention in crystallizing that narrative because it's used as a pretext to further the weaponization of the national security state against the American people. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=624.46s)]
*  So there's a lot riding on it and anything that challenges that narrative, certainly I experienced it directly because Revolver News was at the forefront of challenging various aspects of that official narrative. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=641.46s)]
*  And so this footage is in that vein. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=654.46s)]
*  I think anyone who's paid close attention to the issue already knew that the Capitol Police provoked the crowd gratuitously with flashbangs and so forth. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=658.46s)]
*  Anyone paying attention would have already known that the Capitol Police in many instances opened the doors to the crowd and so forth. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=674.46s)]
*  But developments such as this where the footage becomes more widely available and that scale, like the full range of footage, it's very important because it reinforces the understanding that's already been out there by some of the researchers like we've been doing, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=681.46s)]
*  Julie Kelly and others. And it allows the public to really understand what really happened and the public that hasn't really paid much attention to it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=701.46s)]
*  So I think it's very significant that this came out for a variety of reasons. And my understanding is there's going to be still more footage. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=715.46s)]
*  So a lot of people who may not have paid attention to it, they see this video and they say, this is not what they've been telling me every day for years now. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=722.46s)]
*  You know, the amazing thing too is the role of the media. Obviously the media paid enormous amounts of attention to January 6. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=732.46s)]
*  You could argue it's one of the two or three top stories to which they paid attention for obvious reasons since it happened. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=739.46s)]
*  Usually when there's material that the government has relevant to a story the media is covering, one of the duties of media is to insist on transparency, to press for it, to ask for it, to complain that the government's not releasing it, and then ultimately to sue under Freedom of Information Act or other kinds of provisions that force the government to release it. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=746.46s)]
*  That's one of the jobs of journalists by definition. And we were talking about this last week in the context of the shooting, the mass shooting at that Christian school by that trans woman who wrote a manifesto, killed six people, three of whom were nine-year-old students. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=767.46s)]
*  The other were 60-year-old teachers who left the manifesto. Usually the media feast on these manifestos, wants to get their hands on them so they can figure out what conservative pundits or politicians to blame for having caused the violence, to claim that they were radicalized by this person or that person. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=785.46s)]
*  In this case, we haven't gotten the manifesto for seven or eight months. The Nashville Police Department, the FBI have had all sorts of obviously pretextual reasons why they can't release it, including claiming there's an ongoing investigation still to determine if there was a co-conspirator. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=802.46s)]
*  When everybody knows this person acted alone, there's nothing to investigate. They just don't want this leaking. And then we finally got a few pages through Steven Crowder, and they immediately detected, banned it from even being discussed. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=821.46s)]
*  And in this case, you had almost nobody in the media doing things like retaining counsel. We retained counsel in Nashville. By that point, there were other lawsuits already pending, and they just told us you can repeat it, but these lawsuits are going to make their way through the courts, and now they are. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=834.46s)]
*  But the same thing happened here with January 6, a much bigger story. I don't think there were any media outlets trying to pressure the government to release the footage. Why do you think that is? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=849.46s)]
*  Well, it depends what kind of pressure you mean. I think there are a lot of people who have been saying the full range of footage should be released to the public and not undergo any kind of process of mediation. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=862.46s)]
*  Right. I'm sorry. I meant like media corporations, like large media corporations, like the New York Times, NBC, CNN have not been suing, have not been demanded. That's all I meant. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=880.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=889.46s)]
*  Right. Well, I mean, their vested interest is basically on the narrative that they'd already been promoting. And I suspect that they did have access to it, and based on that access, they selectively presented the footage that best solidified their narrative. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=891.46s)]
*  And what's ironic about that is, for instance, there was a very carefully curated video montage, sort of short documentary thing the New York Times did called January 6 Day of Rage, in which in their full range of footage, they selected the clips that most darkly and ominously suggested a pre-planned attack on the Capitol. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=910.46s)]
*  And guess who appears not once, but twice in this short montage is none other than Ray Epps. So before the New York Times was releasing, publishing fully dedicated puff pieces to Epps, they thought that his participation was so egregious that in the mountains of footage they had access to, it warranted two appearances in their montage designed to portray the narrative that this was a pre-planned attack on the Capitol. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=938.46s)]
*  And that was a pre-planned event of domestic terrorism. So there's a lot of interesting twists and turns when you look into it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=968.46s)]
*  For sure. And I want to ask you about Ray Epps in a second. That was something I was putting on asking about, and I want to get to that in a minute. But before you get to that, there was violence on that day. There were caches between protesters and police, as we've seen in so many protests of various kinds over the last, say, a couple decades in the United States. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=975.46s)]
*  And well before that, I mean, in the 60s, there used to be these kinds of protests all the time where protesters and police would fight against each other. So there was violence. There was some clashes between protesters and police. Some police ended up injured. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=997.46s)]
*  But what are these clips that we hadn't yet seen until just now, things like them entering the Capitol without any attempt to stop them, what do they show us that that narrative that we've been fed excluded? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1010.46s)]
*  Well, and again, like we've already seen this type of footage, but it simply reinforces the fact that in the overwhelming majority of cases, it was people who had been let in or were, you know, went in largely unopposed, who weren't destructive, did not destroy any property, did not assault any officers, and just kind of went with the flow. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1026.46s)]
*  of what must have been a very surreal experience of kind of people just rolling through the Capitol and sort of taking pictures and marveling at how bizarre the whole experience was. And then they're out of the Capitol five minutes later in many instances. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1049.46s)]
*  Then the next thing they know, they're treated like Osama bin Laden. I mean, I think that's the sort of thing that's happening in the United States. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1062.46s)]
*  And I think that's the story of a lot of people who just kind of got caught up in the crowd psychology. But when if the crowd is going in, the cops aren't opposing in many cases, they're opening the door and fist bumping people and chatting with people and so forth. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1071.46s)]
*  You don't really register that you're putting yourself in a position of a future domestic terrorist. And then you, you know, you mosey on through for five minutes, take a few pictures, text your relatives on, this is crazy, I'm in the Capitol, and then you leave. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1094.46s)]
*  And then the next thing you know, your entire life is ruined and turned upside down. So I think the video footage kind of reinforces that reality and helps us to understand how that could be the case. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1110.46s)]
*  And as for the other aspect of the footage on the outside of the Capitol, it shows, again, these gratuitous actions of provocation from the Capitol Police, the flash bangs and things like this that really provoked the crowd. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1123.46s)]
*  And I think a lot of the violent behavior we saw in the part of the crowd was actually agitated and precipitated by these actions of the Capitol Police that may or may not have been given the green light from above. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1140.46s)]
*  Yeah, to this day, it amazes me, you know, that of all the people charged and prosecuted in the January 6 cases, a small percentage of them were accused of using violence. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1154.46s)]
*  The vast majority of them, the state acknowledges, the government acknowledges, did not in fact use violence. And yet we watch people convicted of nonviolent protest crimes, like the Q shaman, for example, who went to prison for a long time, for years, people got [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1166.46s)]
*  prison sentences of years or many months, pre-trial detention, even though they were never accused of any violence. And it's unbelievable to me to watch left liberals cheer and applaud and support the, not just the prosecution, but the imprisonment of nonviolent protesters, political protesters, given the precedence and this would create, this has created and the sorts of things they've always said. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1182.46s)]
*  All right, let's talk about your friend Ray Epps. We've talked many times about him on this show. You've been elsewhere talking about him. Other conservative journalists and pundits have spoken about him raising questions, like he seems to have played a very central role in a lot of these events. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1209.46s)]
*  You see him on video, as you said, the New York Times featured him twice thinking he was a pretty important person. He was on tape really provoking people to storm the Capitol, to use violence, revving them up. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1225.46s)]
*  And yet of all these people that we just talked about went to prison, Ray Epps never did. And it raised the question of why that was. He insisted he had never worked for the FBI, threatened to sue people. I think he has now has sued a couple of people, including Tucker Carlson, who insinuated that he might have worked for the government. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1237.46s)]
*  He now has been charged. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor account, one misdemeanor account. I don't believe he got a prison term or if he did, it was very short. Does the fact that he's now finally been charged and pled guilty change your mind about some of the questions surrounding him? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1254.46s)]
*  No, not at all. I mean, it seems like a very desperate attempt to patch things up, but it's too little too late. You can't wait over two years after when all is said and done and then slap him with a misdemeanor charge that doesn't even match the same charging of other people who have gotten misdemeanors, let alone obstruction of official prescriptions. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1272.46s)]
*  Proceding felony and there's so many other charges available to the Department of Justice. They wanted to use them. They didn't have to wait this long and they could have very easily given him much more severe charges. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1301.46s)]
*  And of course, they don't have to, but the manner in which they exercise prosecutorial discretion is very telling because very early on, a guy named Michael Sherwin, who is in charge of these prosecutions, who advocated infamously a shock and awe approach to arresting as many people before Biden's inauguration. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1313.46s)]
*  He, I think reasonably stated that look, we're going after the conspicuous cases, the cases of people like the Q shaman who were kind of publicly flouting us. The more visible cases were the ones that they wanted to exercise their prosecutorial discretion. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1336.46s)]
*  Make an example of and Ray Epps was among the most visible, if not the most visible. He was one of the first 20 people put on the FBI's most wanted list. As I mentioned, of all the footage, the New York Times could have chosen to reinforce their ominous narrative. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1353.46s)]
*  They chose Epps and they chose him for a reason. He was a very public figure with a sort of made for TV, made for virality moment saying, we need to go into the Capitol, into the Capitol. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1371.46s)]
*  A guy, a former Marine in camouflage with a Trump hat telling the crowds to go into the Capitol, who by the way, people forget this. He was the former head of the Arizona chapter of the Oath Keepers, the most demonized and heavily prosecuted militia group associated with January 6, other than arguably the Proud Boys. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1387.46s)]
*  So with all of this stuff on paper, he would be exactly the kind of person they'd want to make an example of. And they had very easy indictments on him from the very beginning. And not only did they wait over two years to do a sham misdemeanor, which they warned him about in advance, you know, in contrast to all the other people who've gotten the SWAT treatment of, you know, the guns bursting down the doors at three in the morning. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1410.46s)]
*  They just said, oh, by the way, Epps, we want to inform you, you're going to get a misdemeanor charge now over two years later. And by the way, this charge, which, you know, fits into the theory of these ridiculous defamation suits that he has. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1436.46s)]
*  So it's all, you know, so convenient for him. So the short answer is no, I don't think a misdemeanor charge over two years after the fact changes anything but underscores how desperate the regime is to tie up loose ends when it's too little too late. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1450.46s)]
*  Just to tie in quickly to something you were talking about earlier in the monologue, guess who the lawyer the Ray Epps is lawyer is representation for these defamation cases. Guess who he's worked for. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1466.46s)]
*  And he works for now. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1482.46s)]
*  Is it Media Matters? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1484.46s)]
*  None other. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1486.46s)]
*  Well, not quite but close. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1488.46s)]
*  David Brock? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1490.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1491.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1492.46s)]
*  So the fact that now David Brock is in the orbit of Ray Epps is indirectly supporting Ray Epps's defamation suits, which at least until now are technically just against Fox News, not against Tucker or myself. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1493.46s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1510.46s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1511.46s)]
*  I'm not within the within the defamation suit. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1512.46s)]
*  But, yeah, it's pretty remarkable that that David Brock, a lawyer that worked for David Brock, who is of the law firm Perkins Coy, which in a variety of context sits at the intersection of the Democrats and the national security state that this should be the individual to represent Epps. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1515.46s)]
*  And I don't know whether Epps actually has to pay for him or whether it's pro bono or something else. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1538.46s)]
*  But I'd be shocked. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1543.46s)]
*  This is a major law firm in Washington and elsewhere. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1546.46s)]
*  They played a major role in the interaction with Russiagate and the Democrats and the security state with Democratic Party voting suits of all kinds. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1550.46s)]
*  It's an extremely expensive firm. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1561.46s)]
*  I seriously doubt Ray Epps has the ability to pay for it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1563.46s)]
*  The way in which Ray Epps has been turned into a political cause, every single other person in 9-11, January 6 rather, has been talked about as a Satanist, as you said, as like almost a member of Al-Qaeda or worse. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1566.46s)]
*  And yet the media has defended Ray Epps so vigorously as have Democrats from the very beginning. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1579.46s)]
*  They went so out of their way to be able to charge everybody there with felonies. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1585.46s)]
*  We've talked about before the way they had to stretch these precedents, use this Sarbanes Act in order that was really designed to punish people who had done things like impede the Enron investigation by trying to turn this into some sort of interference with an official investigation to turn it into a felony, something that that law had never intended to cover before. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1590.46s)]
*  And yet they went out of their way to make sure Ray Epps got charged with a misdemeanor, even though his involvement was so much greater. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1615.46s)]
*  Back in 2005, when I began writing about politics, there was no more hated enemy, more hated villain for liberal America than Bill Kristol. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1625.46s)]
*  He was the leader of what was frequently then referred to as the neocons, people who had no real partisan attachment. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1634.46s)]
*  They began as Democrats and they moved as part of the war on terror to the Republican Party, knowing that the Republican Party would be more eager under the war on terror to fight the wars they wanted to remove the governments of Iraq and Iran and Syria and their whole other war mongering list. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1643.46s)]
*  And they became leading advocates of the war on terror, of the invasion of Iraq, of the invasion of Iran, of every regime change war that you could possibly imagine. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1658.46s)]
*  Ones that the US ended up fighting, ones that they wanted the US to fight but didn't. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1667.46s)]
*  They're notable for all kinds of things, including ensuring that it's always other people's families who fight in their wars and die in their wars, but never them themselves nor their families. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1671.46s)]
*  We did an entire show on Bill Kristol on the unique evil of this war mongering monster. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1681.46s)]
*  And what is so amazing is that while 15 years ago, every liberal, every Democrat, every leftist agreed that Bill Kristol was essentially the embodiment of all evil, the root of all evil, a neocon monster. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1687.46s)]
*  Bill Kristol has now completely resurrected his career. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1701.46s)]
*  He's never been more influential in Washington and in media than he is now because he has now switched back again to being a Democrat. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1704.46s)]
*  He is a very popular liberal pundit. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1712.46s)]
*  He is funded by Pierre Omidyar, where he runs all sorts of anti-Trump news outlets like The Bullwork. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1715.46s)]
*  And he has all kinds of groups that are funded by Pierre Omidyar designed to promote Joe Biden's war policies in Ukraine and elsewhere. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1722.46s)]
*  And Bill Kristol, who just this week gave an interview to the New Republic where he talked about his actual current party affiliation and the reasons for it. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1731.46s)]
*  There you see the New Republic article. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1741.46s)]
*  Are never Trump Republicans actually just Democrats now? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1743.46s)]
*  You may remember that these never Trump Republicans claim that they were offended by Donald Trump, that they were still conservative, still Republicans. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1747.46s)]
*  They were just against Trump because they wanted to protect and resurrect American conservatism and the Republican Party and its honorable tradition of Dick Cheney and George Bush and Ronald Reagan and Mitt Romney and John McCain. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1755.46s)]
*  And now they've given up that pretense entirely because the people who buy their books and who fund them and who constitute their social media fandom are almost entirely liberals and Democrats. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1768.46s)]
*  And no one wants to hear any pretense is that they're really still Republicans. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1777.46s)]
*  They don't want to ever hear any criticism of Joe Biden. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1781.46s)]
*  So they basically have turned themselves, as the New Republic headline suggests, into just ordinary Democrats now. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1784.46s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1790.46s)]
*  They're Democratic Party pundits. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1791.46s)]
*  And you see the sub headline there. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1794.46s)]
*  Some are already hardcore progressives and pollsters, politicians and analysts from both parties say it may be a matter of time before the rest switch parties too. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1796.46s)]
*  So all the people that we were told were the real villains of international affairs and American politics, these wretched, deceitful, bloodthirsty neocons, aren't just anti-Trump and haven't just been anti-Trump from the beginning. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1805.46s)]
*  It's really worth asking why are they so anti-Trump and why have they been so anti-Trump? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1821.46s)]
*  But they've now become Democrats because they believe that the Democratic Party is the best vehicle to advance their ideology that has not changed at all. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1826.46s)]
*  What has changed is their perception, I think accurately, that they find a lot of hostility to their warmongering agenda and the Republican Party and a lot of positive welcoming of it in the Democratic Party. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1836.46s)]
*  So here from the New Republic article, quote, when asked where he was politically, Bill Kristol told the New Republic, quote, I'm pretty comfortable with the current Democratic Party. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1850.46s)]
*  My fellow never Trumpers are not comfortable with the current Republican Party. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1860.46s)]
*  We don't think the hopes for its immediate reformation are very realistic. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1865.46s)]
*  We are OK with Biden. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1868.46s)]
*  We think, in fact, one thing we could do is strengthen the moderate Democratic Party. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1869.46s)]
*  So that's their mission that they're being, I guess, credibly honest about that they no longer even pretending to try and salvage the Republican Party. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1874.46s)]
*  They are Democrats, pure and simple. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1883.46s)]
*  They're happy with the state of the Democratic Party. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1885.46s)]
*  They want to strengthen the Democratic Party. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1887.46s)]
*  And as part of that effort, Bill Kristol got two million dollars from an undisclosed funder. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1889.46s)]
*  I can only guess who it is to launch an ad campaign designed to essentially increase the support for Biden's war policy in Ukraine, seeing that polls show Americans of all kinds, but especially conservatives and independents, are now turning against that war, believing we've already done too much for Ukraine, not wanting any more money to go to the war in Ukraine, not seeing the benefits of it. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1895.46s)]
*  And so Bill Kristol has produced an ad, ostensibly aimed at Republicans to convince them that the war in Ukraine is actually not only a nice and benevolent thing to do, because everyone knows that's why we fight wars, why the CIA prioritizes wars, because we're good, benevolent, kind, nice, empathetic people who just want to help others in the world. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1918.46s)]
*  The CIA is renowned for all throughout the world. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1938.46s)]
*  But what Bill Kristol is saying is it's not just that we're so kind and benevolent and we believe so deeply in spreading democracy. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1941.46s)]
*  It's also that the war happens to actually be quite good for American interest as well. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1948.46s)]
*  So I thought the ad was really worth watching because it's finally some candor about the real reasons we're in this war. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1953.46s)]
*  Let's watch this ad. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1962.46s)]
*  When America arms Ukraine, we get a lot for a little. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1963.46s)]
*  Putin is an enemy of America. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1966.46s)]
*  We've used five percent of our defense budget to arm Ukraine and with it they've destroyed 50 percent of Putin's army. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1968.46s)]
*  We've done all this by sending weapons from storage, not our troops. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1974.46s)]
*  The more Ukraine weakens Russia, the more it also weakens Russia's closest ally, China. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1978.46s)]
*  America needs to stand strong against our enemies. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1983.46s)]
*  That's why Republicans in Congress must continue to support Ukraine. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1986.46s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1991.46s)]
*  It's essentially saying what has been clear from the beginning, which is United States has no interest in protecting Ukraine. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=1993.46s)]
*  This war has not protected Ukraine. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2000.46s)]
*  This war has destroyed Ukraine. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2001.46s)]
*  And the longer the war goes on, obviously, the more Ukraine will be destroyed. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2003.46s)]
*  And we're not protecting or defending Ukrainians. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2008.46s)]
*  The longer this war goes on, the more Ukrainians are dying. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2012.46s)]
*  So Len's case fighting with an increasingly desperate untrained army of conscripts who are desperately trying to flee the country but are being trapped there through a combination of military force and closing the borders and all kinds of steep punishments for those who try to flee people who don't want to be used as cannon fodder who know that's what they're being sent to the front for who are dying in gigantic numbers. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2015.46s)]
*  And the US wants this war to go on. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2038.46s)]
*  We have not only not pursue diplomatic solutions, but we have blocked the attempt to achieve diplomatic solutions, according to people like Israeli Prime Minister Naphtali Bennett, who said that he has tried to broker solutions at the start of the war but was blocked by doing so from the Biden administration and Boris Johnson, who wanted this war to go on precisely because as the ad shows, the real purpose of this war has nothing to do with protecting Ukraine. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2041.46s)]
*  It's to advance Americans, America's geopolitical interests as they see it in weakening Russia by essentially saying we're not dying for this war. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2067.46s)]
*  We're having Ukrainians die in huge numbers for this war, and we're getting the benefits. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2078.46s)]
*  Now, again, I still question in what conceivable way does the United States benefit from weakening Russia? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2083.46s)]
*  How is that a benefit to the United States, one that's worth tens of billions of dollars or hundreds of billions of dollars or sending huge numbers of young Ukrainian men to die for in a war? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2090.46s)]
*  Both President Obama and President Trump spoke about the ability to cooperate with Russia. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2100.46s)]
*  They're the fact that they did cooperate with Russia on crucial anti-terrorism policies, including fighting ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq, which is a common goal of both Washington and Moscow. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2105.46s)]
*  They have cooperated in all sorts of other ways. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2118.46s)]
*  And yet it was really only after 2016 when American elites needed a villain to blame, and they decided they were going to blame Vladimir Putin and Russia. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2121.46s)]
*  And liberals started feeding on this nonstop anti-Russia discourse to drum up their hatred and anger and contempt and desire to avenge what they believed were the crimes of Vladimir Putin. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2130.46s)]
*  Only then did Russia become this country who we were supposed to go and destroy. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2144.46s)]
*  But this at least is a step forward to an honest debate, even though I don't think it really intended that. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2149.46s)]
*  I think what it's intending to do is to say to Americans, look, we know that you no longer are moved by the bullshit pretext that we're there in Ukraine because we're good, nice people protecting the Ukrainians. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2155.46s)]
*  You want to know what this war is doing for you. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2167.46s)]
*  And we're here to say this war is actually helping you because for a very small price in the context of the trillion dollar budget that our military consumes every year, even though it can't pass an audit, we are destroying Russia. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2170.46s)]
*  Now there's again no reason given why that benefits Americans. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2184.46s)]
*  This is to assume that Americans will be happy about that fact. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHqPfNfxMuA&t=2188.46s)]
