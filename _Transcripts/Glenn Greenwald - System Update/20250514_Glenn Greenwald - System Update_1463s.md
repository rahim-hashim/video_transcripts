# Jake Tapper Book Reveals Corporate Media ROT
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=0.0s)]
*  So there's a new book out this week that most of the media is talking about. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=7.24s)]
*  It was highly anticipated. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=11.48s)]
*  It reports to sell the story of how the White House and the Democrats, quote, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=12.84s)]
*  covered up the story of Joe Biden's cognitive decline and the implicit premise [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=18.64s)]
*  which they are all very eager to promote is a fairy tale, namely that the Biden [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=27.32s)]
*  White House covered it up and therefore the media had no way of knowing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  It's a book by CNN's Jake Tapper, who, as I said, was actively involved in this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=36.96s)]
*  cover up. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=43.6s)]
*  He was the one demanding and insisting, as we'll show you, that nobody talk [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=44.08s)]
*  about Biden's cognitive decline because it wasn't real and wasn't true. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  And he claimed it was just a stutter. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=51.28s)]
*  And he accused those who brought up the cognitive decline or pointed it out not [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  only of spreading right wing disinformation, but also cruelly [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  stigmatizing children with a stutter by mocking what he said was Joe Biden's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  stutter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=70.04s)]
*  And so Joe Biden, Joe Jake Tapper writing a book pretending to have uncovered the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=70.48s)]
*  cover up that he participated in would be exactly if Nancy Pelosi wrote a book [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=78.72000000000001s)]
*  denouncing the immoral corruption of members of Congress who profit off the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=84.92s)]
*  stock market. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=89.92s)]
*  You'd be like, what? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  How does Nancy Pelosi write? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=91.68s)]
*  Of all people, write a book on the immorality and the corruption of having [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=93.76s)]
*  House members get very rich by trading on the stock market while they're in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=98.68s)]
*  office. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=101.84s)]
*  It would be absurd. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  Everybody would laugh at that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  That's how people should receive Jake Tapper's book as well. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=105.28s)]
*  Or not only the book itself, but the fact that Jake Tapper is an author of it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=109.28s)]
*  Here from CNN is an announcement of the book, new book on Biden by Jake Tapper [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  and Alex Thompson reports a quote, cover up about Biden's mental decline. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  So this has been coming for a long time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=126.72s)]
*  Now, one of the really interesting things to recall here is there's an [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=128.72s)]
*  excerpt in The New Yorker by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=133.8s)]
*  It's an excerpt from their book, obviously designed to generate interest in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=142.16s)]
*  And it's describing this passage is, I'm sure many of you remember, there was a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=143.16s)]
*  huge glitzy fundraiser in Hollywood for Joe Biden in the middle of 2024. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  And that was when Obama had to lead Biden off the stage because he obviously and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=155.6s)]
*  blatantly didn't know where he was. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=161.16s)]
*  And a lot of people said, Joe Biden's just lost. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=163.84s)]
*  He has no idea where he is. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=166.4s)]
*  That's why Obama had to like take him by the arm the way you do like a relative in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=167.56s)]
*  a nursing home. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=172.12s)]
*  And you kind of help them walk. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=173.68s)]
*  You guide them to make sure, you know, they're a little confused. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  You make sure that that's what Obama did to Biden. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=177.52s)]
*  And here's the video just for you, for you, for your memory. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=181.8s)]
*  It was June of 2024. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=185.24s)]
*  There's Obama and Biden on stage. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  And Obama's trying to walk off, but Biden's not really doing so. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  He's just kind of standing there aimless, not really sure where he is. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  Obama's waving, trying to get off and then he grabs the grandfather by the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=202.0s)]
*  wrist, puts his hand on his back, kind of guides him off stage because otherwise [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  Obama would still be there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=213.44s)]
*  Biden was never going to leave that stage. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=214.56s)]
*  He had no idea where he was, how to get off. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=215.88s)]
*  And we've seen that many, many times by far the first time, not the first time [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=218.4s)]
*  that we've seen Joe Biden obviously completely lost about where he's supposed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  to go, where he is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=226.68s)]
*  And when people pointed this out, when people pointed out that Joe Biden was [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=229.8s)]
*  blatantly confused and had to have Obama guide him off the stage, the media and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=234.32s)]
*  the White House in unison went berserk and started claiming that anybody who [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=242.32s)]
*  looked at this video and used it that way was using what they called a cheap [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=248.32s)]
*  fake, a play on the word deep fake, which is when you actually altered the video, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=252.76s)]
*  but they were trying to claim this is a video taken out of context. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=256.64s)]
*  It is, if you look at it from different camera angles, you get a completely [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=260.4s)]
*  different impression. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=263.76s)]
*  It was about two weeks after Biden had that moment at the D-Day celebrations [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=264.4s)]
*  in France with the other EU leaders where he just had to, where the Italian [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  prime minister, Georgia Maloney had to kind of walk over to him after Macron [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  told her to and pull Biden back into the picture. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=280.2s)]
*  And when we saw him in Brazil too, when he went to the Amazon, he just like gave [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=283.88s)]
*  a press conference and he thought he was in the White House. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=287.8s)]
*  So he just like turned around and started walking back, but he walked into the, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=289.72s)]
*  to the jungle, to the Amazon. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=293.92s)]
*  He doesn't know where he didn't know where he was. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=296.32s)]
*  He was often lost and confused. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  And everybody saw this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=300.64s)]
*  The polls reflected people overwhelmingly believe he was in cognitive, he had [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  cognitive impairment, was too old to run for reelection that he wasn't capable of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=306.24s)]
*  doing the job and the only people who pretended not to know were the media. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=311.4s)]
*  And that fundraiser in particular is just so telling of the whole fraud that took [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=316.08s)]
*  place here because in their book, in this new book, they excerpt this part of the, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=321.64000000000004s)]
*  of the story about what happened that night, namely George Clooney, who was a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=330.92s)]
*  huge, has been a huge democratic fundraiser. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  He was at this fundraiser for Joe Biden. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=337.32000000000005s)]
*  He's known Joe Biden forever. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=339.0s)]
*  This is what happened when he walked up to Joe Biden, according to this book, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  quote, how Joe Biden handed the presidency to Donald Trump. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=344.44s)]
*  So they're blaming Biden for this, which he certainly deserves a lot of the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  blame, but by no means the only part of the blame. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=351.2s)]
*  And the book says this quote, at a fateful event last summer, Barack Obama, George [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=354.84s)]
*  Clooney and others were stunned by Biden's weakness and confusion. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=360.4s)]
*  Why did he and his advisors decide to conceal his condition from the public [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  and the campaign for reelection? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=370.88s)]
*  It wasn't concealed from the public. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=372.44s)]
*  The public saw it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=375.44s)]
*  You can go back in time and see all sorts of people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=376.48s)]
*  I was one of them saying, Joe Biden's like, he doesn't know where he is. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=379.12s)]
*  It was so obvious. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=383.04s)]
*  It was the media who covered it up and attacked everybody who pointed it out as [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=385.36s)]
*  being Russia, right wing disinformation agents, probably Russian disinformation [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=389.92s)]
*  agents engaging in chief fakes. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=393.56s)]
*  The only people who covered it up were the media in unison with the White House. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=395.2s)]
*  Nothing was concealed from the public. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=400.0s)]
*  This is what happened according to the book when George Clooney went up to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=403.24s)]
*  Biden quote, thank you for being here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=407.2s)]
*  The president said to guess as he shoveled past them, thank you for being here. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=409.32s)]
*  So that was the phrase he used with everybody. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  And that's because he didn't recognize anybody. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  And then it says Clooney felt a knot form in his stomach as the president [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=421.52s)]
*  approached him, Biden looked at him and said, thank you for being here. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=426.2s)]
*  He said, thank you for being here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  And then an assistant aide told the president, you know, George, trying to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=431.36s)]
*  gently remind him of who was in front of him, George Clooney. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=436.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=439.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=440.32s)]
*  The president said to one of the most recognizable men in the world, the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=440.48s)]
*  host of this lucrative fundraiser, thank you for being here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=443.04s)]
*  Hi, Mr. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=447.0s)]
*  President Clooney says, how are you? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=447.44s)]
*  The president replied. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=449.68s)]
*  How was your trip? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=450.68s)]
*  Clooney asked. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=451.48s)]
*  It was fine. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=452.0s)]
*  The president said it seemed clear that the president had not recognized Clooney. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  Quote, it was not okay. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=456.12s)]
*  Recall the Hollywood VIP who had witnessed the moment. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  Quote, that thing, the movement where you recognize someone, you know, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=460.48s)]
*  especially a famous person who's doing a fucking fundraiser for you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  It was delayed. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  It was uncomfortable. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=467.92s)]
*  George Clooney, the aide clarified for the president. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=472.76s)]
*  Biden said, hi, George Clooney was shaken to his core. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=473.20000000000005s)]
*  The president hadn't recognized him. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=478.16s)]
*  A man he had known for years. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=479.88s)]
*  Clooney had expressed concern about Biden's health before. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=481.96s)]
*  A White House aide had told him a few months before that they were working on [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=484.36s)]
*  getting the president to take longer steps when he walked. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=487.8s)]
*  But obviously the problem went far beyond his gate. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=490.84s)]
*  There were things, this was much grayer. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=493.24s)]
*  Now, after that event, maybe a month or so after, George Clooney wrote a op-ed [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=498.12s)]
*  in the New York Times that he was going to be the president of the United States. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=506.12s)]
*  Op-ed in the New York Times, which created a lot of stir. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=510.24s)]
*  It was something most Democrats were afraid to say, but George Clooney is a [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  very loyal Democrat, always has been, big fundraiser of the Democratic Party, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=518.52s)]
*  the Clintons, Obama, Biden. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=522.04s)]
*  And so he wrote this article in July of 2024, headlined in the New York Times [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=525.8s)]
*  headline, George Clooney, I love Joe Biden, but we need a new nominee. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=529.96s)]
*  And this is what he wrote, quote, it's devastating to say it, but the Joe [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=535.36s)]
*  Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe big [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=538.84s)]
*  f*****g deal Biden of 2010. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=544.6s)]
*  He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=547.08s)]
*  He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=549.0s)]
*  Now, keep in mind that debate was the turning point where they were all [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=552.96s)]
*  insisting, no, there's nothing wrong with Joe Biden at all. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  He's absolutely, totally fine. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=559.64s)]
*  And it was only once he went to that debate and practically drooled on himself, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=562.4s)]
*  constantly like lost track of what he was saying in the middle of sentences, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=566.96s)]
*  just kind of drifted off, put words together that were completely nonsensical [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=570.24s)]
*  and had that like vacant stare of somebody whose brain's not functioning [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=576.76s)]
*  the whole time, basically looking 90 or a hundred. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=580.44s)]
*  It was only then that this all became untenable. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=585.4s)]
*  And it was only then the media started saying, oh my God, we didn't know. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=587.32s)]
*  It looks like Joe Biden's cognitively impaired. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=591.28s)]
*  I never would have imagined that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=593.44s)]
*  This is the first time we're seeing it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=595.44s)]
*  Even though Clooney ended up admitting that he saw it at that fundraiser when [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=598.6400000000001s)]
*  people were saying it and still getting attacked by the media for it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=602.44s)]
*  Jake Tapper appeared on one of the CNN programs today. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=606.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't know who this host is. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  They're all interchangeable and poorly watched, but he was talking about his [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=611.2800000000001s)]
*  book, promoting his book, talking his book as though again, he was the one who [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  uncovered the story when he was the one who helped conceal it as we're about to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  show you. And they obviously have a couple parts of their book. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=625.32s)]
*  They're trying to spread the media, generate interest. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  And here's the little tidbit that he said. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=630.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm curious about what his advisors were saying at the time as you look at this, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  as you reported out this book. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=640.44s)]
*  So the White House physician, Dr. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  Kevin O'Connor, was telling White House aides that President Biden's deterioration [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=646.12s)]
*  of his spine, the degeneration, was so significant that if he fell one more time [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=652.24s)]
*  that he might have to be in a wheelchair and serve in a wheelchair for his second [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=657.36s)]
*  term. But everybody pushed off the notion that he used a wheelchair until after the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=662.8s)]
*  election. This is all part of a larger whole where the Biden White House tried to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=668.48s)]
*  hide the extent of his deterioration, both physical and cognitive, as much as [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=673.44s)]
*  possible. In fact, as you we all know, we all saw. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=680.12s)]
*  Do you see that's the whole formulation? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=684.64s)]
*  This was all part of the White House's effort to cover up and conceal what was [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=687.16s)]
*  actually going on with Biden. They're turning themselves into the victims. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=693.72s)]
*  They're basically in the posture of when they all circulated the lies about WMD [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=697.96s)]
*  because Cheney was leaking it and Paul Wolfowitz and that whole crew. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=703.8s)]
*  And then afterwards, when it turned out there were no WMDs there, they weren't [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=708.6s)]
*  like, oh, yeah, we were to blame. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=711.16s)]
*  Actually, the New York Times did take a little blame and said we probably should [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=713.16s)]
*  have been more skeptical of these assertions without evidence. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=716.12s)]
*  Oh, you think? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=719.64s)]
*  But mostly it was them trying to depict themselves as victims. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=721.4s)]
*  Like, yeah, we were we had the wool pulled over our eyes by this government that we [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=723.96s)]
*  trusted. They're back 20 years later making the same exact excuse. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=727.8s)]
*  Yeah, we spread a bunch of falsehoods and lies, but it wasn't our fault. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=731.4s)]
*  We're as angry as you are. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=735.32s)]
*  We're the victims of the exact same thing. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=736.52s)]
*  Except, again, they were the ones who knew it as well as anybody because they were at [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=741.08s)]
*  the White House talking to these people all the time. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=746.76s)]
*  And it's a friend of the show, Barry Eisler, said on Twitter today, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=750.12s)]
*  the Jake Tappers of the world are in a really difficult position. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=757.48s)]
*  They basically have two choices, none of them good. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=760.36s)]
*  Either number one, you admit that you knew and were complicit in the coverup to try and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=763.64s)]
*  make sure Donald Trump lost and Joe Biden won, which is the truth. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=768.12s)]
*  Or number two, you admit that even though you call yourself a journalist, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=772.68s)]
*  you are incapable of noticing or discovering a fact about Joe Biden that ordinary people [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=778.5999999999999s)]
*  who aren't paid to do that work all saw for themselves with their own eyes. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=785.0799999999999s)]
*  So either you're corrupt or just incredibly ignorant and dumb. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=789.08s)]
*  Let me put the rest of this to hide the extent of his deterioration, both physical and cognitive, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=794.12s)]
*  as much as possible. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=801.24s)]
*  In fact, as you we all know, we all saw as his shuffling gate got worse and worse from 2003 to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=803.24s)]
*  2004, they started putting AIDS around. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=810.2800000000001s)]
*  He meant from his shuffling gate got worse from 2023 to 2024. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=814.5999999999999s)]
*  And I want you to remember that because you're about to see Jake Tapper attacking people who [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  were noticing it at the time. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=823.7199999999999s)]
*  2004, they started putting AIDS around him as he walked to Marine One, the helicopter that was to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=825.48s)]
*  kind of hide from public view how bad his gate was, how bad his walking was, his shuffling, and also [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=832.52s)]
*  in case he stumbled again to make sure somebody was there. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=838.52s)]
*  And this is just of a piece. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=840.8399999999999s)]
*  Of an overall campaign to try to conceal from the American people the extent to which the president [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=842.36s)]
*  was really struggling to do his job. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=847.4s)]
*  I can't tell you how sick that makes me to watch. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=851.96s)]
*  I mean, these are the people who perpetrated the deceit and the crime. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=855.48s)]
*  And they're there saying, yeah, we wrote a book to because we're so angry that the White House [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=860.36s)]
*  covered this up and made it impossible for us to know in the meeting. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=866.84s)]
*  What was going on with Joe Biden? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=870.92s)]
*  I mean, you would see him walk on and off the stage. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=872.5999999999999s)]
*  You would see him shuffling. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=876.76s)]
*  But that wasn't even the worst. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=879.0s)]
*  Nobody really cares if there's some physical deterioration. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=881.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, if he was old and he had to sometimes be in a wheelchair, you know, so what? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=885.9599999999999s)]
*  FDR had polio and was in a wheelchair and most of the media knew and they kept it from the public [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=889.8s)]
*  because it was just a physical condition. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=895.4799999999999s)]
*  It didn't affect his brain or his judgment. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=898.28s)]
*  The real issue is that Joe Biden's brain was melting, not that his spine was degenerating. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=901.4s)]
*  Here is a compilation from our friends at Gravian of all the times that Jake Tapper attacked people [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=908.6s)]
*  for having suggested there's something wrong with Joe Biden over the years. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=917.64s)]
*  And the first one is Laura Trump, who, you know, was a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  said that in an interview or an event that when she watches Joe Biden, she feels sorry for him. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=928.4399999999999s)]
*  And she's saying, come on, Joe, get out the sentence, finish the sentence. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=933.0s)]
*  And here's what Jake Tapper said it was. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=936.8399999999999s)]
*  How do you think it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment like that? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=939.8s)]
*  It's very clearly a cognitive decline. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=944.52s)]
*  That's what I'm referring to. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=947.24s)]
*  It makes me uncomfortable. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  You have you are no. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=949.64s)]
*  You have you have. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=950.5999999999999s)]
*  You have. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=951.3199999999999s)]
*  I can't. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=951.88s)]
*  It's so amazing. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=952.36s)]
*  It's so amazing to me that. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=953.24s)]
*  And try and figure out an answer. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=954.4399999999999s)]
*  A cognitive decline. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=956.4399999999999s)]
*  Biden embraces his stutter talking about it while Trump mocks it, exaggerates it, belittles it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=957.48s)]
*  He's sharp physically. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=962.84s)]
*  I mean, mentally. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=964.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=965.5600000000001s)]
*  I think the question is physically. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=965.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=967.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=967.64s)]
*  So right. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=967.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=968.6800000000001s)]
*  And the guy who's his chief opponent is only three or four years younger than me. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=968.84s)]
*  You have questioned President Biden's age, mental fitness, ability to lead [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=972.6s)]
*  of those supporting Biden. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=976.44s)]
*  You said, quote, shame on all of you pretending everything is OK. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=977.64s)]
*  You're leading us and him into a disaster. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=980.12s)]
*  This is all 2024. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=981.96s)]
*  Here he is interviewing Dean Phillips, the Democratic Congress from Minnesota, who ran [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=983.88s)]
*  against Biden, even though the DNC wouldn't allow a primary. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=989.4s)]
*  And he said to war Trump. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=993.7199999999999s)]
*  You're talking about Biden's inability to get out of the sentence. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  He has a stutter that nobody ever noticed before. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=999.48s)]
*  He has a stutter. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1003.48s)]
*  How how dare you? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1004.28s)]
*  Do you have no shame? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1005.9599999999999s)]
*  How did that make children with a stutter feel knowing that you're mocking them? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1007.72s)]
*  I didn't even know he had a stutter. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1011.08s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1012.6s)]
*  I've seen him talk for a long time. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1013.1600000000001s)]
*  I didn't even know he had a stutter. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1014.84s)]
*  I was talking about his cognitive decline, his inability to think and reason and speak. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1016.2s)]
*  And Jake Tapper, who now has written a book purporting to tell the whole story, blow [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1022.84s)]
*  the lid off this campaign of deceit, said to her, oh, yeah, OK, I'm not even going to [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1028.3600000000001s)]
*  let you question his cognitive ability. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1033.96s)]
*  You have no basis whatsoever for him to be able to talk. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1036.3600000000001s)]
*  You have no basis whatsoever for doing that. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1039.4s)]
*  And then here's the same thing he did with Dean Phillips. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1041.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, you have questioned President Biden's age, mental fitness, ability to lead of those [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1045.48s)]
*  supporting Biden. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1049.88s)]
*  You said, quote, shame on all of you pretending everything is OK. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1050.68s)]
*  You're leading us and him into a disaster. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1053.16s)]
*  Do you worry that you damaged him at all? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1055.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't doubt that you got hugs and handshakes behind closed doors today and maybe even [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1057.4s)]
*  publicly, some of them because they like you personally. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1063.24s)]
*  But I've heard a lot of really nasty stuff about you from your Democratic colleagues. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1066.12s)]
*  I mean, just like what is he thinking? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1070.84s)]
*  Exercise and narcissism. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, false claims to the Wall Street Journal about President. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1075.32s)]
*  Do you see what Jake Tapper is doing here? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1079.8s)]
*  He's vicious. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1082.84s)]
*  I mean, he's so visibly angry. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1083.8799999999999s)]
*  He viciously attacks anybody. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1086.28s)]
*  Who questioned Joe Biden's cognitive fitness. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1089.8s)]
*  So again, everybody around Jake Tapper knew, the whole public knew. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1092.68s)]
*  He said Laura Trump was attacking and making life difficult for children with stutters [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1097.8s)]
*  and telling Dean Phillips, yeah, you may have some friends who said you're great, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1105.64s)]
*  but the people I have heard from absolutely hate you. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1109.96s)]
*  But the whole time people are telling him, look, Joe Biden has a problem with cognitive decline. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1114.76s)]
*  And Jake Tapper was the one, one of the primary people in the media, not just covering it up [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1119.72s)]
*  and denying it, but aggressively attacking and mining the character of anyone who was raising [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1125.72s)]
*  this as recently as last year, presumably when he was working on his book or at least [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1131.4s)]
*  anticipating the book. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1138.6s)]
*  I think actually they announced the book in early 2025. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1139.64s)]
*  It usually takes a lot longer than three, four months to write a book like that, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1143.0s)]
*  but they're probably rushing to do it so they could be first. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1146.36s)]
*  So maybe he wasn't writing the book at the time, but this is all what Jake Tapper is [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1149.08s)]
*  purporting to blow the lid off of what he was doing. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1154.04s)]
*  So as a narcissism, I mean, false claims to the Wall Street Journal about President Biden's [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1157.3999999999999s)]
*  mental fitness and acuity. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1162.36s)]
*  He's 81 and his memory, you know, it doesn't seem great. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1164.36s)]
*  It's not horrible, but I don't understand the outrage. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1167.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, behind closed doors, Biden's shows signs of slipping. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1170.84s)]
*  Unquote, the Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp, which is run by the Murdochs. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1174.52s)]
*  Beyond the headline, there... [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1178.6s)]
*  So this is what... [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1179.72s)]
*  There was an extremely long and well-reported article in the Wall Street Journal in July [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1181.16s)]
*  or August of last year. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1189.4s)]
*  Obviously, the Wall Street Journal is a respected newspaper, especially among them, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1192.36s)]
*  and it described all these people saying, Joe Biden's brain is fried. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1196.92s)]
*  You know, like you sit in a room with him. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1201.96s)]
*  He can't even follow a conversation. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1203.56s)]
*  Like sometimes he's better than other times, but often he's just like, doesn't know where [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1206.76s)]
*  he is. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1212.2s)]
*  He can't follow anything. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1212.52s)]
*  And you had like, Kevin McCarthy went on the record, most of them off the record, you know, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1214.44s)]
*  anonymously, but including Democrats. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1218.76s)]
*  And did you see the snotty little way that Jake Tapper tried to disparage the story by [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  saying this comes from the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp, which is controlled [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1226.84s)]
*  by the Murdochs? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1231.56s)]
*  Trying to act as if the Wall Street Journal's reporting was the partisan hit-job rather [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1233.56s)]
*  than what Jake Tapper was doing. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1237.56s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp, which is run by the Murdochs. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1241.0s)]
*  Beyond the headline, there is some critical nuance here. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1244.52s)]
*  The article is mostly based on observations of Republicans, with former speaker Kevin [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1246.76s)]
*  McCarthy the only one going on the record. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1251.24s)]
*  They do note in the article that most of the criticism comes from Republicans. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1254.2s)]
*  Have you heard any concerns from anyone who has met with President Biden about him [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1257.88s)]
*  seeming a little slower? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1263.5600000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1265.16s)]
*  The Russians are trying to do to make us and the public not trust our election integrity. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1265.4s)]
*  So he did blame it on the Russians, of course. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1271.0s)]
*  And there he's saying the Wall Street Journal is only interviewing Republicans about it, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1275.16s)]
*  and he goes and asks Chris Coons, the Democrat from Delaware, Biden's home state, oh, have [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1279.3200000000002s)]
*  you noticed this? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1284.8400000000001s)]
*  And he's like, no, I haven't noticed anything. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1285.4s)]
*  Biden seems great. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1286.92s)]
*  Now here's the cover of the book. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1289.24s)]
*  It's called Original Sin, President Biden's Decline, its Cover-Up, and his Disastrous [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1292.6000000000001s)]
*  Choice to Run Again by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1298.52s)]
*  Can you imagine being Jake Tapper and having done all this? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1303.0s)]
*  I'm going to write a book about the people who covered this up, like those people over there, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1306.52s)]
*  because I'm really angry about how they deceived the country. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1311.64s)]
*  The country wasn't deceived. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1313.96s)]
*  The country knew it all. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  The only ones pretending not to know were people in the media like Jake Tapper. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1317.3200000000002s)]
*  Here's a news story. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1324.1200000000001s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Benson says the growing recession fears are, quote, media driven. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1325.4s)]
*  We've all seen how mainstream media often manipulates public opinion. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1331.8000000000002s)]
*  We just spent an hour showing you on that. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1334.52s)]
*  They push their narratives that serve their interests. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1335.96s)]
*  They tell one side or one part of a story. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1337.96s)]
*  That's why I started this show and then partnered with Ground News. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1340.92s)]
*  They're a platform built on the belief that you deserve to see the whole truth without [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1344.52s)]
*  corporate filters or political censorship. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1348.92s)]
*  For every story, their app and website pulls in every single report from across the political [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1351.16s)]
*  spectrum. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1355.72s)]
*  So all I have to do is swipe through coverage with tags exposing each outlet's bias, credibility, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1356.04s)]
*  and corporate influence to find out the facts they're ignoring and why. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1361.16s)]
*  So take that story I mentioned about Scott Benson and Trump's tariffs. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1364.84s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Benson called out the media for fueling unnecessary [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1368.84s)]
*  recession fears because the fundamentals of our economy are strong. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1373.24s)]
*  But when you look at who's actually reporting on it, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1376.76s)]
*  every single outlet is coming from the right that's promoting that narrative. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1380.28s)]
*  There's almost no coverage from mainstream and liberal media on that. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYwHqEAbmg&t=1383.0800000000002s)]
