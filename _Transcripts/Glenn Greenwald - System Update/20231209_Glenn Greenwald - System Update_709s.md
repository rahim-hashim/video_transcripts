# Well, TikTok Permanently Banned Our Show
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8)
*  All right, so it's kind of ironic when you report something and then very shortly after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=0.0s)]
*  that you have a personal experience that in many ways verifies or vindicates the thing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  that you reported. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=19.44s)]
*  So we did a segment last week knowing that we know that many of you have become convinced [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=21.76s)]
*  that TikTok is this weapon of the Chinese Communist Party that they use to get at the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=28.16s)]
*  minds of American youth in particular, that they're propagandizing them, they're turning [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=33.52s)]
*  against them, them against the country, they're filling their head with all kinds of crazy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=38.64s)]
*  ideas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=43.28s)]
*  And we tried to show you that that is a false narrative. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=45.44s)]
*  TikTok is run by a Singaporean who was born in Singapore. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=50.56s)]
*  He's a capitalist. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=57.56s)]
*  He went to the London School of Economics. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=58.56s)]
*  He then went to Harvard Business School. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  He then worked for Goldman Sachs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=61.52s)]
*  They have American management, American shareholders, and the United States has become one of their [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=64.52s)]
*  most lucrative markets because of how many millions of Americans choose to use TikTok. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=70.72s)]
*  And they don't want to have to be, they don't want to be banned from the United States. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=78.36s)]
*  They're willing to do anything to stay here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=82.72s)]
*  And one of the things they've been increasingly doing is saying to the United States government, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=85.88s)]
*  look, we don't care about political speech. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=88.88s)]
*  If you want to tell us what political speech you find damaging or dangerous, just tell [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=93.88s)]
*  us and we'll censor it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=97.56s)]
*  Remember they censored the Bin Laden letter once it went viral. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=100.84s)]
*  Why would they censor the Bin Laden letter which explains to Americans or tries to convince [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=103.22s)]
*  Americans that 9-11 was the fault of the US government for interfering in that region [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=108.64s)]
*  and bombing that region if they were interested in being divisive and dividing the American [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  people against their own government. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=119.52s)]
*  They would love the Bin Laden letter. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=120.72s)]
*  They would let the Bin Laden letter viralize. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=122.0s)]
*  They wouldn't censor it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=123.6s)]
*  And yet they did censor it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=124.96s)]
*  And this first came up for us because we had a video in December of 2022, so a little bit [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=129.32s)]
*  ago, that was highly critical of President Zelensky and the Ukraine War and the narrative [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=139.36s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=145.52s)]
*  There you see it on the screen erasing inconvenient truths. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=146.52s)]
*  And this video started to go rather viral. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=151.36s)]
*  And obviously the Chinese Communist Party wouldn't want to stop this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=156.24s)]
*  It was a video critical of US foreign policy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=161.56s)]
*  That's supposedly what the Chinese Communist Party wants. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=164.52s)]
*  They want people hearing content like what we produce that is critical of the US government, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=168.44s)]
*  the US security state. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=172.56s)]
*  And yet we got a notice, there you see it on the screen, video removed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=175.82s)]
*  This video violates our community guidelines. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  It was a segment like the one I just did about the lies around the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=186.02s)]
*  There you see the video details. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  President Zelensky is a corrupt authoritarian oligarch despite what Western media is trying [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=193.9s)]
*  to tell you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=199.66s)]
*  And the reason cited was integrity and authenticity. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=201.1s)]
*  Trust forms the foundation of our community. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=206.62s)]
*  We do not allow activities that undermine the integrity of our platform or the authenticity [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  of our users. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  We got an account warning for that and it said your account is at high risk of being [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=215.22s)]
*  restricted based on your violation history. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=218.98s)]
*  The next withdraw could result in being prevented from accessing some features. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=222.5s)]
*  Now we thought it was very strange since this was actually the first time this has ever [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=230.66s)]
*  happened and we appealed this removal and we actually won. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=233.6s)]
*  They looked at it, they reinstated it and they removed this warning from our permanent [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=239.33999999999997s)]
*  record. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  The only other time we've had any issue with TikTok was with this video in June of 2023 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=246.14s)]
*  where we reported on how the CIA had flown to Brazil as part of the 2022 election. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=254.7s)]
*  Basically according to the US to warn the Brazilians not to use the sort of election [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=262.09999999999997s)]
*  fraud claims that Trump had used and that Bolsonaro was threatening to use if he lost. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=268.18s)]
*  But it was the CIA flying to Brazil in the middle of the Brazilian election to basically [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=273.94s)]
*  intervene and say this thing that Bolsonaro was threatening to do, we're not going to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=278.1s)]
*  accept it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=283.38s)]
*  And the reporting on this was very reliable. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=285.62s)]
*  It was from mainstream outlets and we did a video and actually you see there it was, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=287.42s)]
*  we put Portuguese subtitles on the screen so that Brazilians could hear it as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=294.3s)]
*  This was probably our most viral video on TikTok ever, certainly one of them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=299.24s)]
*  It really went viral. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  And we got the same kind of notice, video removed, the video violates our community [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  guidelines. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=310.74s)]
*  Here you see the CIA's benevolent interference in Brazil and the same rationale cited. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=311.74s)]
*  Now let me ask you this question. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=320.82s)]
*  If the Chinese Communist Party were censoring TikTok and controlling its content, why would [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=323.70000000000005s)]
*  the Chinese government be angry that we publish a video on CIA involvement in Brazil? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=330.78s)]
*  Wouldn't that be something they would want? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  If this narrative is true that they're using TikTok to turn the government, the people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=341.41999999999996s)]
*  of the United States against their own government? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=345.29999999999995s)]
*  They would love our show. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=349.34s)]
*  Our show is overwhelmingly a critique of the US government and the US security state and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=350.5s)]
*  US foreign policy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=355.14s)]
*  Why would TikTok be targeting our show if it were run by the Chinese Communist Party [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=358.1s)]
*  and removing videos critical of US foreign policy? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  That makes no sense whatsoever. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=367.3s)]
*  It would only make sense, the only people angry by these kinds of videos from our show [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=371.1s)]
*  would be the US security state, the thing we criticize. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=374.8s)]
*  The entity that has previously tried to think of ways to prosecute me when I went around [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=380.12s)]
*  the world reporting on all their secret documents as part of the Snowden reporting. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=384.18s)]
*  When I was at the intercept where we often publish secret documents about their drone [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=389.72s)]
*  program and their FBI spying programs. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=394.34s)]
*  My good friends in the US security state, those are the people who would want our content [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=398.82s)]
*  censored. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=402.62s)]
*  And that is exactly who is commandeering the TikTok content moderation. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=404.26s)]
*  This time we did appeal and it did not get reinstated. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=410.66s)]
*  This video was removed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=419.26000000000005s)]
*  We had this strike against us, but this is the only strike that we ever knew about. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=421.26000000000005s)]
*  This week our social media manager went to access TikTok to post and she got this notice. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  Your account was permanently banned due to multiple violations of our community guidelines. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=434.88s)]
*  Permanently banned. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=440.68s)]
*  Our account was permanently banned. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=441.68s)]
*  Our system update account. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=443.02s)]
*  The only thing we use this account for is to post clips of this show. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=445.88s)]
*  When we appealed it or asked for some kind of explanation, they sent us this email. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=451.1s)]
*  Thank you for contacting TikTok. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=459.12s)]
*  We understand how important your account is to you. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=461.2s)]
*  After further review, your account will remain permanently banned due to a violation of our [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=464.08s)]
*  integrity and authenticity policy. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=468.4s)]
*  Please note that our community guidelines apply to both public and private videos and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=472.28s)]
*  that was it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=476.12s)]
*  We could not get any kind of an answer on why it is that our account is banned, but [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=477.12s)]
*  we know that it's permanently banned. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=485.0s)]
*  We can't get an answer why. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  I hope this forever debunks this notion that the people controlling the censorship decisions [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=490.92s)]
*  of TikTok are the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  They have turned over TikTok as these decisions to the US security state just like the US [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  security state influences and controls the censorship decisions of Facebook and Google [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=507.92s)]
*  and in the pre-Musk era of Twitter because they have used this threat to ban TikTok [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=512.64s)]
*  as a way to say the only way we're going to let you stay is if you censor the things we want. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=519.88s)]
*  This also shows by the way, imagine if we had this show and there was no rumble, no [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=525.92s)]
*  platform that said to us we're going to guarantee the right of free speech and we were dependent [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=532.64s)]
*  on Big Tech, on Google's YouTube, on Instagram owned by Facebook, on TikTok. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=538.4s)]
*  Do you see how, what a strangleholder is on free speech in the West? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  Do you see this? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=550.24s)]
*  Say what you want about our show and my views, but our reporting is extremely fact based. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  I've been doing this for 20 years now. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  I've won every journalism award that the West has to offer. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=564.88s)]
*  There's no journalist in the United States that has won as many. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=571.2s)]
*  Maybe there are some who have won as many, but none who have won more. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=576.52s)]
*  Our show, if you watch it, you know that we are very careful to adhere to facts, usually [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=583.4s)]
*  facts that are easily demonstrable on the public record. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=589.62s)]
*  We don't spread disinformation. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=594.52s)]
*  We don't rely on conspiracy theories. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=595.72s)]
*  This is purely content based. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, the last two months of our show has been overwhelmingly dedicated to a critique of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=600.12s)]
*  the US funding of the war in Israel and the war in Israel itself. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=605.12s)]
*  I don't know if that's a factor, but I know that our show in general is a critique of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=607.96s)]
*  the US foreign policy state and of the censorship regime. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=613.84s)]
*  We also did criticize TikTok as well, so who knows why, but look at how arbitrary and capricious [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=619.6s)]
*  this is. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=624.76s)]
*  If your livelihood, if your ability to be heard rests on big tack, you're just in the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=626.4s)]
*  palm of their hands. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=632.92s)]
*  They can squeeze it at any time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=633.92s)]
*  It's so coffee-esque. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=636.04s)]
*  They don't even give you a reason. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=637.04s)]
*  They give you no explanation at all, let alone an opportunity to appeal or be heard. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=639.88s)]
*  They just send you a form letter saying, no, you're permanently banned and that's going [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=644.88s)]
*  to remain that way forever. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=647.84s)]
*  This is why platforms like Rumble are so important, because if we had to rely on this, I'd imagine [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=651.36s)]
*  how nervous we would have to be about what YouTube allows, what Google will say, we can [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=655.72s)]
*  say, what we can't say. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  Every time you get a strike against you on a video, you're petrified that the next one [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=662.96s)]
*  might result in the destruction of your show, your destruction of your ability to be heard. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=666.6s)]
*  The range of views they allow is extremely narrow, and that's why I think this fight [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=671.88s)]
*  for free speech is the most important. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74DKkytSD8&t=678.12s)]
