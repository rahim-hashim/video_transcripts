# Roger Waters Addresses Israel-Gaza, Antisemitism Accusations | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI)
*  First of all, let me just ask you about these issues with anti-Semitism for a second. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=0.0s)]
*  You talked about the horror and sickness and disgust you feel watching what the Israelis [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=11.9s)]
*  are doing in Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=16.98s)]
*  And I have to say for me, and maybe it's just a byproduct of things I focus on, but I honestly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=17.98s)]
*  don't recall anything that has made me sicker or more disgusted than seeing the level of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=23.46s)]
*  suffering that's taking place in Gaza right now and knowing that we're only at the beginning, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=29.26s)]
*  way closer to the beginning than the end. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=33.18s)]
*  It's one of the worst crimes, if not the worst one, I've seen in my life. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=35.44s)]
*  But when the attack on October 7th in Israel happened from Hamas, what was your reaction [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=39.72s)]
*  to that? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=45.92s)]
*  Let's wait and see what happened. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=46.92s)]
*  Well, it was my first reaction. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=48.56s)]
*  My second reaction was, how the hell did the Israelis not know this was going to happen? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=50.92s)]
*  And I'm still a little bit down that rabbit hole. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=55.68s)]
*  I mean, didn't the Israeli army in those 10 or 11 camps hear the bangs when they blew [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=59.1s)]
*  up whatever they had to blow up to get across the border? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=66.28s)]
*  There's something very fishy about that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=70.84s)]
*  Yeah, we had an Israeli Knesset member on who said it seems inconceivable. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=72.72s)]
*  This is one of the most surveilled places on the planet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=76.92s)]
*  And there's obviously going to be a lot of investigation, maybe not an honest one, but [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=80.3s)]
*  Israelis are angry about that as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=84.62s)]
*  What I'm asking about though is, do you think what Hamas did on October 7th can be justified? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=86.42s)]
*  Well, A, we don't know what they did do, but was it justified for them to resist the occupation? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=92.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  But again, it's what you said, it's the Geneva Conventions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  They are absolutely legally and morally bound to resist the occupation since 1967. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=106.94s)]
*  It's an obligation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=115.06s)]
*  But are there limits on the way in which they can resist? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=116.5s)]
*  As I said in the statement that I put out after it, I said if war crimes were committed, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=119.46s)]
*  I condemn them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=125.38s)]
*  I don't care who it is. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=127.38s)]
*  And here we are now three weeks or so after, do you think there's been evidence that's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=128.82s)]
*  emerged that suggests they committed those? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=133.12s)]
*  There may have been individual... [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=136.06s)]
*  I was reading a new story this morning, which... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=138.02s)]
*  Grayson, our friend Max Blumenthal. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=143.34s)]
*  So there's a long story which I read this morning, but Haaretz have finally come out [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=146.18s)]
*  with figures of how many people were actually killed and who they were. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=151.94s)]
*  On that day. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=155.7s)]
*  On that day, yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=156.7s)]
*  And so probably the first 400 were Israeli military personnel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=157.9s)]
*  Who are? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=163.26s)]
*  That is not a war crime. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=164.26s)]
*  No, clearly everyone thinks military officials and military targets or soldiers in Israel [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=165.62s)]
*  are military targets. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=172.22s)]
*  Well, it depends if you believe in the Geneva Conventions or not. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=173.22s)]
*  Or the United Nations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=177.22s)]
*  But what about targeting civilians or adopting them? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=178.38s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=182.02s)]
*  No, of course I don't condone that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=184.02s)]
*  But the thing was thrown out of all proportion by the Israelis making up stories about beheading [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=186.86s)]
*  babies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=195.26s)]
*  They even got the President of the United States, dotard that he is, to claim that he [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=196.26s)]
*  had seen photographs... [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  Of the beheaded babies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=205.66s)]
*  Of the beheaded babies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=206.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=207.66s)]
*  And then admitted that he actually didn't. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=208.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=210.66s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's... [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=211.66s)]
*  But what we do know is whether it was a false flag operation or not or whatever, or whatever [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=214.34s)]
*  a story we're going to get to. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=221.42s)]
*  And we don't know if we will ever get much of a real story. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=224.14s)]
*  It's always hard to tell what actually happened. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=228.7s)]
*  They're calling it their 9-11. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=231.7s)]
*  What the hell happened on the American 9-11? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  But clearly the official narrative has huge holes in it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  And anyway, let's not go into the 9-11. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=243.38s)]
*  But I guess that when people... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=246.66s)]
*  There are two kinds of people, I think, who raise this anti-Semitism accusation against [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=249.58s)]
*  not only you, but people like you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=255.1s)]
*  Because you criticize the Israeli government. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=256.38s)]
*  One is because you criticize the Israeli government. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=257.9s)]
*  The other is the claim that you seem to value Palestinian lives more than Israeli lives. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=259.78s)]
*  What absolute patent nonsense. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=266.9s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=270.34s)]
*  What is your... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=271.34s)]
*  Complete rubbish. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=272.34s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=273.34s)]
*  This is the whole point of the difference between my platform and the Israeli government. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=276.02s)]
*  I believe in equal human rights for all our brothers and sisters all over the world, irrespective [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=282.38s)]
*  of their ethnicity, religion or nationality. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=290.78s)]
*  The Israeli government doesn't. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  For instance, just in that locale there, what we could call the Holy Land if we wanted to, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=299.22s)]
*  they consider that people who are of the Jewish religion have completely different set of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=306.7s)]
*  rights to everybody else. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=314.02s)]
*  This is fundamentally important. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  That's why in my message I go, do you subscribe to the idea of equal human rights or not? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=319.3s)]
*  Because as soon as you don't, you are a Nazi. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=327.9s)]
*  And I know people... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=332.58s)]
*  You can't say Nazi. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=333.58s)]
*  Well, all right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=334.58s)]
*  No, but the Nazi ideology is not unique to Germans. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=335.58s)]
*  It can be anybody who adopts that view that some human life is more valuable than others. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=337.82s)]
*  Anybody who is supremacist is whatever you want to call it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=342.82s)]
*  A fascist. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=347.17999999999995s)]
*  Or you just say, oh, he's, she, they are those people who consider themselves superior to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=348.17999999999995s)]
*  That's why they call them animals. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=356.42s)]
*  That's why they dehumanize them. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=358.46s)]
*  That's why they are committing genocide on them today. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=360.98s)]
*  I'm sorry to grit my teeth, but I weep at you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=365.98s)]
*  No, it's horrific. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=368.3s)]
*  You're saying this is the most horrific thing in your life. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=369.3s)]
*  It is in my lifetime. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=371.78s)]
*  I'm 80 years old. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=372.78s)]
*  This is the most horrific thing to happen in front of my eyes. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=374.7s)]
*  And yet the government of the United States of America where I live... [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=380.74s)]
*  And of the UK. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=385.3s)]
*  And, and yeah, the UK, I don't live there anymore. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=386.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=390.94000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=391.94000000000005s)]
*  But and all the vassal states in the European community are all just giving the Israelis [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=392.94000000000005s)]
*  cart-rush to murder two women. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=401.22s)]
*  Why are they doing that? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=403.5s)]
*  Well, you tell me, Glenn. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=404.5s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  It has something to do with some kind of political expediency that I don't understand. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=409.5s)]
*  Well, we just had, just about two weeks ago, we interviewed Professor Stephen Walt and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=415.1s)]
*  then yesterday we interviewed Professor John Mearsheimer, both of whom co-wrote the book [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=420.46s)]
*  The Israel Obvious 2006. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=424.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure you do, which purported to explain where this kind of influence comes [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=425.9s)]
*  from. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=432.9s)]
*  And they were very clear that it's not just the standard obvious response of, well, there's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=433.9s)]
*  a lot of American Jews and Western Jews who exercise a lot of political influence. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=437.94s)]
*  There's also, you go to Congress, as one of my friends who's a journalist, Lee Fong, did, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=441.74s)]
*  and we interviewed him last night too. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=446.18s)]
*  And he went and interviewed a bunch of members of Congress and said, why is your posture [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=448.06s)]
*  that you want to give the Israeli government anything it wants, that there's no criticism [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=452.66s)]
*  permitted, that they'll never say no to the Israelis? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=457.42s)]
*  What kind of country has that posture toward others? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=460.24s)]
*  And a lot of them will openly say it's because we believe religiously that Israel has to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=462.14s)]
*  be strong because only then can Jesus return and have this rapture-like event. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=467.78s)]
*  So they're Christian fascists. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WSb23wdLI&t=472.61999999999995s)]
