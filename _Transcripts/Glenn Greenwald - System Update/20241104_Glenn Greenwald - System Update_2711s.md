# Asking PA Voters: Kamala Or Trump?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s)
*  Hello world. We are in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. The state of Pennsylvania or Commonwealth, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=0.0s)]
*  as you might be aware, is a heavily contested quote-unquote swing state in the 2024 presidential [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=8.16s)]
*  election. Are you excited by my introduction so far? I know I am. And what we're doing is basically [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=17.04s)]
*  just talking to random people about their thoughts on the election, their voting preferences. Do [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=25.28s)]
*  they plan to vote? Have they voted already? Do they not plan to vote? What are their feelings [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=32.36s)]
*  on Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, and Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee? You [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=39.08s)]
*  may have heard of them. And yeah, that's what the agenda is for today, which is the final Sunday [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=45.8s)]
*  before the election. And as always, we're out doing a public service. For all of you, you should [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=58.16s)]
*  be really appreciative of the sacrifices that we make on behalf of our nation and democracy and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=64.2s)]
*  truth and justice. So what's your name? Al. And what are your thoughts on the election? Are you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=71.48s)]
*  going to vote? If so, for who? I voted by mail. Who did you vote for? Kamala. And what was your [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=78.64s)]
*  reason? A lot of reasons. I think she's more for the people. I think she'll do better for us. And [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=86.64s)]
*  I don't really want to go to the others, go somewhere else. But yeah, I think she's just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=93.92s)]
*  more for people like me. What's your line of work? I've been working in technology for 30 years. And [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=103.04s)]
*  what do you fear might happen if Trump were to win? If Trump were to win? I think there's a lot of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=115.44s)]
*  things that as far as Social Security, I mean, who knows what you're reading is true, right? But [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=124.56s)]
*  there's a lot of things that I just don't like about his policies. I think women should have the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=135.28s)]
*  right to do what they want with their own bodies. And I don't think the government should be [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=141.24s)]
*  involved in any of that. How about foreign policy? So there's obviously been a war in the Middle [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=147.12s)]
*  East for the past year, war in Ukraine. I mean, do you think that you have hope for how Kamala [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=153.28s)]
*  would conduct foreign policy given what's happened in the Biden administration? I would hope so. I [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=160.84s)]
*  would hope so. They try to calm things down, try to stop all this. I'm not good at this, guys. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=165.6s)]
*  I'm terrible. So what do you think is going? I'm not that much of a political person, to tell you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=179.48s)]
*  So last question for you then. Who do you think is going to win regardless of who you want to win? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  That's a tough one. I think it's going to be close. And I don't know. I just let you say I hope [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=192.48s)]
*  Kamala wins. That's all I got to say. So what is your name, ma'am? Monica, Monica Allen. And you [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=199.64s)]
*  were telling us that you've voted already. I didn't want to go to vote because I'm concerned [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=208.8s)]
*  about picketers and all that stuff. This is a hard decision for everyone. And everyone who it's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=214.96s)]
*  an easy decision for that doesn't make sense, feel strongly about their side. And I feel strongly [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  about my side. And explain the basis for your strong feeling. I guess I'm not far left or far [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=230.32s)]
*  right. Those are the people that concern me. The minute we lost Wade versus Roe. Roe versus Wade. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=239.76s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Women's rights. I was shocked. I mean, how can you say what a woman can and cannot do [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  with their body? That really worried me about more things going on. You know, we need, I'm [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=259.2s)]
*  Democratic, obviously, we need more in the House and the Senate. Because if Republicans take it [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=267.24s)]
*  over, unfortunately, I'm not against Republicans, but the far right seems to be leading the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=273.8s)]
*  Republican Party. And that concerns me the rights for transgender, the rights for biracial marriage, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=279.8s)]
*  for LGBTQ. You know, I believe you can marry whoever you can love who you feel strongly about. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=287.28s)]
*  And I just don't think the government has a right to get into that. So Trump has said he's claimed [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=296.0s)]
*  that he would not sign into law a national abortion ban. Kamala Harris and Democrats say [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=302.96s)]
*  that's not to be believed. But that's what his at least stated policy is. What do you make of that? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=310.96s)]
*  He wants it to be a state policy. To me, that's still government taking over what rights a woman [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=318.24s)]
*  has. Because they haven't really been threatened all that much in Pennsylvania, right? No, no. But [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=325.88s)]
*  what about the woman or the 12 year old girl? There was one, I don't know what state. She... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=332.2s)]
*  I think this was in Texas, I think. Yeah. Incest. She was raped by her uncle, father, whatever it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=338.24s)]
*  may be. And she could not get an abortion in her state. Does she have to bring up a child from, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, incestuous relationship? I just think if they're going to take it away, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=355.16s)]
*  give it for people who need it medically, who are trying to get pregnant and may have to have a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=363.48s)]
*  tubal pregnancy, have to get rid of it. I've been... anyone who's been raped, anything like that, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=370.68s)]
*  they need to at least give that. Do you know a lot of people, maybe women in your age group or [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=377.24s)]
*  people that you socialize with who have similar views as you on this? And that's like one of the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=384.48s)]
*  primary factors motivating their vote? It's a mixed bag. I mean, I have relatives who are [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=392.2s)]
*  definitely on the other side. You said this was a heavily Trump area in your perception, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=400.52s)]
*  If you go down my street, it's all Trump signs. It is overall, I can't say Phoenixville itself, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=407.96s)]
*  you know, because it is a young crowd and stuff like that. But I don't know a lot of people that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  believe in the way I believe. I think they're more or less, either they don't care or they [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=424.56s)]
*  don't feel strongly. And I feel very strongly about certain things. Do you approve of the way [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  that Kamala Harris has run her campaign? Do you think she's done a good job? Yes and no. You know, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying Kamala Harris is like the best person to be there. I would love to see us vote [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=449.48s)]
*  for a vice president and a president separately. You vote, there are no parties whatsoever. That [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=456.64s)]
*  used to be the case in the early American history, like 1800. I know I had a problem with Republicans, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  you know. But it's so different now and the world has changed since, I hate to say it, since Trump [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=470.0s)]
*  was there. It has separated so many people and it's scary. I'm scared to see what's gonna happen. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=478.92s)]
*  What scares you the most about what you think may happen if Trump were to win? He'll never [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=486.96s)]
*  leave office. He wants to be king. He wants to be, there'll be no Congress. He wants to rule [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=494.36s)]
*  everything. He has said it. Look at what he wants to do on his first day. You know, all these people [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=503.64s)]
*  who don't agree with him. He wants the Army or any military to deal with them. What does that mean? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=510.2s)]
*  How would that work in practice? Like would Trump abolish the 22nd Amendment? Because that requires [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=516.72s)]
*  that presidents only serve two terms. Just what he did when he said he won and how long he still [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=521.96s)]
*  says he won. And he didn't. I mean, I stayed up and saw the election. It all turned around, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=531.48s)]
*  well, the first election when he did win, it all turned around at the end. The second one, you know, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=537.4s)]
*  he didn't win. And he doesn't like when anyone disagrees with him. And I personally don't think [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=544.28s)]
*  he's a very good businessman. So finally, what do you think will happen? What's your gut feeling [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=552.4s)]
*  as to who will win? Regardless of what your preference is, which you've obviously been very [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=562.36s)]
*  clear about. I don't know what my gut is. My gut is I'm scared if Trump wins. It's 50-50. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=568.36s)]
*  I would like to see it go the other way, but there are so many people that believe in him [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=579.0s)]
*  and follow him. Vote Harris. I don't care if you're an independent Republican. I think she'll take [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=584.48s)]
*  control and put things where they need to be. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  All right. So we're here in Phoenixville. Encountered some non-voters because they're [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=603.5200000000001s)]
*  not legally eligible to vote in the United States, but they're here and they have observations in the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=610.24s)]
*  election that I thought were interesting. So you were talking about you're from Kenya and you were [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=613.6s)]
*  kind of comparing and contrasting the election dynamics in Kenya versus here. Just to elaborate [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=618.88s)]
*  on that. Yeah. Like I was saying, it gets very tribal. So, you know, people vote based on the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=624.24s)]
*  tribes that they're from. And so you see some of those similarities here where like a Republican, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=631.84s)]
*  Democrat, and for the most part, let me not say for the most part, but a common theme is, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=640.24s)]
*  you know, when somebody goes to the voting booth, they're just going to go down checking Democrat or [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=649.04s)]
*  checking Republican, right? And I don't think they're considering all of the person's policies [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=654.88s)]
*  or they're looking into it. It's more of, it's very much identity based and playing for your home team. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=662.72s)]
*  And so that could kind of get a little dangerous. It's funny. You came and you asked the two non-citizens. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=670.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. American citizens. Like, what do you guys think about the, oh, we can't vote. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=677.84s)]
*  Hey, you're here. You've experienced it. You've absorbed it. So you might have some thoughts. Why not? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=682.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, if you, how do you think, have you followed the election closely [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=687.76s)]
*  enough to have a view on how it is that each party tries to play on these identity allegiances? Like [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=694.56s)]
*  how did the Democrats do it and how the Republicans do it? Are there any differences between how they [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  employ that tactic as far as you could tell? Yeah, sure. There are those, like I said, it's more [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=708.0s)]
*  Hey, you identify with this race or black, you know, you're black. So you got to vote Democrat [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=718.64s)]
*  because they're looking out for your best interests. I don't really know that I've seen [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=724.3199999999999s)]
*  Republicans being like vote Republican because you're white. I can't say I've seen that. So it [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=731.52s)]
*  wouldn't be. Well, Trump does say if you vote, if you're Jewish and you vote for the Democrats, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=736.0s)]
*  you have to have your head examined. So they do their own slight version of it. You could say, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=740.0s)]
*  What did he mean by that? He meant that Democrats don't support Israel enough. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=743.92s)]
*  And that he would be much more assertive in his support of Israel. And then he assumes that [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=749.36s)]
*  Jewish voters place such a premium on the issue of Israel that they will be crazy, essentially, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=755.28s)]
*  to vote for the Democrat as opposed to for him and the Republicans. So he's saying that they're [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=762.8s)]
*  essentially voting against their own interests. Yes, when it comes to Jewish voters, yes. But [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=769.84s)]
*  you're right that the Democrats kind of traditionally will say and even Barack Obama was out recently [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=775.12s)]
*  sort of lecturing black men in particular for not being sufficiently supportive of Kamala Harris. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=780.0s)]
*  And in so doing, betraying their collective interests. Right, right. Yeah. So that and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=786.32s)]
*  that's the thing that I'm saying is it's not trying to figure out the right words here. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=793.2s)]
*  It's not in good faith. Right. It's like, hey, you better vote this way because you're, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=801.76s)]
*  you know, melanin, melanated person. It's like, is that the only thing that it is valuable about [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=807.6s)]
*  me as a person? Right. I have so many more. There's so much more to my personhood than just this. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=815.84s)]
*  So it kind of feels that type of thinking is what, you know, Kamala says we're not going back. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  Right. And it's like, well, that type of thinking is what puts us back because now I can't see past [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=828.48s)]
*  this. Right. There's so much more up here and in there, but I'm not allowed to express that [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=834.48s)]
*  because I'm just supposed to stop here. So if you could vote, it sounds like you [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  might have a preference for Trump over Kamala or am I wrong headed on that? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=846.16s)]
*  I mean, how'd you come to that conclusion? Well, just an educated guess. I could be wrong, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=852.64s)]
*  but just based on what you said so far that, you know, you have doubts as to the democratic [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  campaign messaging where they try to play on people's identity traits and maybe the Republicans [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=862.88s)]
*  might be an alternative to that, but I don't know. You tell me. Yeah. Like I said, when you, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=868.16s)]
*  when it comes down to the identity politics, it's very off putting because, you know, in Kenya, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=874.0s)]
*  this was, I think. Somebody just screamed my name. I have no idea who that was, but I, somebody [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=884.8s)]
*  screamed my name. Yeah, it's a new one. So we've seen some guy in a pickup truck screamed out my [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=892.24s)]
*  name out. Mike Trace. Mike. He screamed Mike Tracy. Is that what he screamed? I think so. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  Is that what you're acting? Mike Trace. That's what he said. Say Mike Trace. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  Mike Trace. I guess I'm a big celebrity in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. But yeah, no. So [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=911.2800000000001s)]
*  I've seen that that sort of mindset lead to a lot of violence. Like I said, in Kenya, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=916.24s)]
*  some years back, 2007, I think, where the violence was out of hand. You know, people just aiming [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=924.32s)]
*  to brutalize other human beings just because they're from a different tribe. So I don't like [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=934.24s)]
*  that sort of rhetoric. I mean, there are people on the Democratic side that I really liked, like [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=941.6s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard was really awesome. I thought she was great. If I could vote, that's the person I [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=948.48s)]
*  would have voted for. She's endorsing the Republicans now. She is now, right? After being accused of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=954.0s)]
*  being a Russian agent and all that stuff. So yeah, that's the other thing that I, it's just a very [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=961.12s)]
*  ugly affair all around. Because you start saying one thing and all of a sudden the people with the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=968.8000000000001s)]
*  loudest or the most powerful positions deem you to be something that you're not. Right? This is a [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=974.88s)]
*  woman who served in the military, right? She served two tours. I mean, in the, was she in Iraq? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=980.96s)]
*  Served two tours, was serving in Congress, right? She was what? Representative of Hawaii, house rep. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=989.76s)]
*  And you get somebody who's held one of the highest positions, because Hillary was the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=996.64s)]
*  secretary prior, right? Secretary of state. Secretary of state accusing you of being a [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1003.8399999999999s)]
*  Russian agent just because she didn't like what you said about, she didn't like what Tulsi's [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1010.56s)]
*  criticisms against her with the warmongering and all that stuff. It's just, it's a very ugly affair. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1017.92s)]
*  So it's off-putting. A lot of this stuff, you, you know, sometimes it's even, you hesitate to talk [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  about it with strangers because you're always expecting people to take the worst version of [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1030.48s)]
*  what you're saying. Yeah. And I, and I sympathize with that apprehension. I try not to do that. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1038.4s)]
*  So it's much easier to have these types of conversations with people you know, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1048.96s)]
*  people that understand you, right? People that take what you're saying in good faith. Like, oh yeah, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  I know this guy. I know him. I've known him since we were young. I understand his perspectives. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1058.24s)]
*  I understand his value systems. I understand why he's saying what he's saying. You say that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1062.4s)]
*  to a stranger, like, oh, I'm supporting this person. And all these like preconceived notions [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1068.08s)]
*  are just projected to you. Like, oh wow, you must burn crosses at night. Like what? How'd you come [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1073.36s)]
*  to that? Like, how'd you, you know what I mean? So, so, so again, would you vote if you could? And [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1078.64s)]
*  if so, for whom in this election? I would vote if I could. And out of the two choices, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1084.8s)]
*  you know, I would vote for Trump out of the two choices. But like I said, when Tulsi was running, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1090.72s)]
*  if I could vote, that's the person I would have cast my vote for. I just think she's a much more [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1098.32s)]
*  balanced in how she speaks. There's other people who are very well spoken. I like that. I like [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1106.08s)]
*  a person who's able to go to different groups of people and understands how to speak to different [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1113.12s)]
*  groups of people and add nuance to the conversation. I really appreciate that. Who do you think will [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1118.32s)]
*  win regardless of your preference? Oh man, I don't, I don't really. I, maybe Trump might win, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1125.28s)]
*  but you know, there's certain things like there's this, they're betting, right? Yeah. They're [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  betting on the votes now. That's a huge market. Seems a little bit questionable to me. Yeah. So [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1140.08s)]
*  like I opened my Robinhood and I seen like it's on the front page, on the homepage. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1145.84s)]
*  And I think right now Kamala is up. I think Trump is slightly up right now. That's the last I checked [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1153.84s)]
*  today. What's the bottom numbers? It was like, it was saying 68 million to like 59 million. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1159.84s)]
*  I know when you convert it to percentage, the betting markets, last I checked as of this morning, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1165.44s)]
*  it's like 53, Trump 47, Harris, something like that. 53 Trump? Likelihood to win, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1170.3999999999999s)]
*  percentage likelihood to win. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. It flip flops. And so you're not sure, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1176.72s)]
*  you know, are these polls accurate? Are they not? I mean, during the time of Clinton and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1184.96s)]
*  Trump, you know, polls seemed one way and the outcome was another way. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1190.24s)]
*  So it's kind of hard to tell, but are you a, are you a student here? Like what's your, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1194.24s)]
*  why are you in the U S? I'm in the U S cause my family came to the U S. Are you trying to get [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1198.3999999999999s)]
*  citizenship? Yes. I mean, it's a great nation. We were just talking about that. He's contacting, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1204.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, he's, I was just asking him about his friends back in Germany and they're reaching out [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1213.12s)]
*  to him and they're like, why are you over there? You know, you need to come back over here. Blah, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1218.56s)]
*  blah, blah. It's the place to be. It is. It's a great, great, great, great nation. You know, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1222.32s)]
*  it's a wonderful place to be. It's not perfect by any means, but you know, I dare anyone to go and [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1227.76s)]
*  find the perfect country. And if you're in America and you're saying that place over there, that's [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1237.6799999999998s)]
*  the perfect place. Ask yourself why you're not there. Right. A lot of people in the U S seem [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1242.3999999999999s)]
*  to promote the U S as the best country. That's why there's a lot of people with American flags [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1248.16s)]
*  draped in their houses and cars and things. So there's kind of an enthusiasm, I think about the [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1253.76s)]
*  perceived superiority of the U S here. Yeah, it's, it's ebbs and flows. There's times where [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1259.52s)]
*  it's like America is the worst place ever. And then there's times it's like, it's the best nation. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1266.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, it comes like that ebbs and flows. What's your name? Rodney. And do you hear my [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1271.52s)]
*  name correctly? Rodney? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I go to Starbucks, I say Rodney, they say Riley. So I'm like, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1278.0s)]
*  no, I heard it loud and clear. I think nobody, nobody messes up Michael, thankfully, because [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1283.44s)]
*  it's the most common name in America. Yeah. And you live in Phoenixville or thereabouts? I don't [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1287.76s)]
*  live in Phoenixville. Where do you live? Outside of Phoenixville. All right. Well, thanks for chatting [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1294.96s)]
*  with us. Appreciate it. Yeah. Yeah. So you guys clearly are in favor of Trump. See the Trump cowboy [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1301.52s)]
*  hat there. Why are you voting for Trump this time? Have you voted already? Are you going to go vote [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1308.8s)]
*  on Tuesday? We are going to vote on Tuesday. And what's your reasoning? I love everything about Trump. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1315.2s)]
*  You know, the thing that gas prices are out through the roof or taxes are going out of [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1321.76s)]
*  control because everything's so expensive. But now our property taxes is jumping up. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1328.8799999999999s)]
*  Like you can't afford to even live at your house. You're going to have to sell your house soon [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1334.64s)]
*  because you can't afford taxes because everything's so expensive. It just snowballs. And the other [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1338.08s)]
*  person that's running against them is going to make it worse. It's just common sense. Trump is the man. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1344.32s)]
*  Did you vote for Trump the last two times? I didn't the first time. I actually voted for [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1351.76s)]
*  Hillary the first time. The second time I didn't vote for him. I mean, I did vote for him. And then [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1356.4s)]
*  I started thinking maybe I shouldn't vote for him because every time I vote for somebody, they lose. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1363.28s)]
*  So it's like bad luck. Yeah. But I'm definitely voting for him. But we came in here for a couple [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1368.0s)]
*  things of groceries and spent a hundred bucks. Like what'd you buy just now that cost? Some pasta, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1373.36s)]
*  spaghetti sauce, and some cheese. And a couple odds and ends. Yeah, a couple odds and ends. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1380.56s)]
*  It's over a hundred bucks? Yep. Crazy. It's out of control. And it's going to get worse. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1386.96s)]
*  And what concretely do you think that Trump or the Republicans could do to [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1393.84s)]
*  bring down the food prices? The first thing is to get the gas prices down because that, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, when gas prices go up, it's going to cost more money to ship stuff and blah, blah, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1405.44s)]
*  blah. It just snowballs. And so if you get that down and then you have to start going over after [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1410.24s)]
*  the companies to try to get them to start lowering their prices because it's going to be cheaper to [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1415.92s)]
*  run the factories. So hopefully that's the key thing that's going to bring the prices down. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1421.68s)]
*  And what about in terms of internationally? Do you follow foreign policy at all? You have a war in [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1428.48s)]
*  the Middle East now, war in Eastern Europe. What do you think that, what would you want Trump to do [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1434.4s)]
*  differently? He just has to get in the White House. Build that wall. Build the wall. No, I think just [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1441.2800000000002s)]
*  him being in the office is going to scare them people and set them straight, you know, because [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1450.24s)]
*  we have a, you know, president that's afraid to do anything right now, you know, and, you know, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1454.48s)]
*  with Trump in there, people are scared of him overseas and they will start, you know, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1461.76s)]
*  listening to him and hopefully the wars will stop. That's the main thing. But they're walking all [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1468.0s)]
*  over Biden because he's a, I don't want to say it, but yeah, he's a pussy. And who do you think is [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1475.28s)]
*  going to win regardless of who you want to win? The way it looks, I'm sorry, go ahead. The way it [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1485.52s)]
*  looks, when I see people out there and I see you on the internet and when I went to the thing over [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1492.96s)]
*  in Oaks for Trump. What'd you go to in Oaks? The town hall. And it was pretty, really exciting. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1498.32s)]
*  But people were dropping like flies because it was so hot in there. This was over the summer? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1505.92s)]
*  No, this was just last month. Oh really? Okay. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1510.72s)]
*  Trump was here in Oaks at the Oaks Convention Center over there. But just the excitement of Trump, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1513.68s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it in my life and I'm 65 years old and it's no way that he can lose [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1520.64s)]
*  unless they're pulling funny stuff as you see already this week, what they're trying to do in [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1528.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania by stuffing the ballots from people from out of the state. So, you know, you never know. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  So you think if Trump does lose or if he's declared to have lost, the only way that could happen is [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1540.72s)]
*  if there were some sort of fraud? It has to be. It has to be. I can't see that Trump wouldn't, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1547.28s)]
*  you know, win. I mean, unless there's something going on. I mean, I'm not just saying because [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1555.92s)]
*  what happened to Trump last time, but just you could just see it. You know, you can feel it. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1560.4s)]
*  It's going to be a tough race, especially when you have a woman that's running, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1565.12s)]
*  plus she's mixed and then you've got Trump who people either hate him or they like him. But [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1569.4399999999998s)]
*  is it, are they going to vote because she's a lady and it'll be the first woman [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1576.7199999999998s)]
*  and African American, I believe she is. A lot of women are apparently wanting to vote for [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1580.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris because of the abortion issue and they claim that Trump and the Republicans are [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1589.12s)]
*  going to ban abortion. Now he says he wouldn't sign a law at the federal level that would [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1594.24s)]
*  curtail abortion, but people have their suspicions on that. What are your thoughts on that? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1598.72s)]
*  Well, being a victim of rape, that is something that I struggle with with Trump, but that's the [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1603.28s)]
*  only thing. Now there's got to be more to what he's saying as far as, you know, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1611.28s)]
*  women will be convicted and put in jail or. That's all the other side saying that just to get people [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1616.56s)]
*  to vote against them. Well, there are some states, not Pennsylvania, but other states that have [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1623.28s)]
*  imposed very restrictive abortion laws. They're pretty strict states. I guess they're mostly in [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1626.8799999999999s)]
*  the religion. Yeah. Oklahoma, Texas, places like that. Yeah. Well, that's, you know. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1632.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't believe in just killing an unborn baby. And I understand that maybe some women should [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1638.56s)]
*  be held accountable for, you know, not being grown up and using your head and having protection and [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1643.36s)]
*  whatever. But if it's a rape situation or something bad like that. And then on the other flip [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1650.56s)]
*  side of that is, you know, you have people having kids out here and they're out here trying to raise [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1657.52s)]
*  money with their posters and stuff. You know, stop having the kids. So it's a double edged sword. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1663.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, I don't know, like, you know, but what are you going to do? I mean, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1672.72s)]
*  that's all they got to run for on the other side. Yeah. I mean, that's, I mean, that from what I [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1678.0s)]
*  could tell, that's all the Democrats want to talk about. That's all they got. I mean, the past [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1681.92s)]
*  three and a half years, you could tell they got nothing they could run on. I see the Kennedy's [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1687.44s)]
*  running too. So hopefully he's, he's a Trump card. He endorsed, he dropped out and endorsed Trump. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1692.16s)]
*  Right. But I have friends of mine who just voted and they're like, oh, Biden, Biden, Biden. Oh, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1699.3600000000001s)]
*  I voted for Kennedy. You're an idiot. They voted for Kennedy, even though he withdrew his campaign. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1704.88s)]
*  He just thrown your vote away. Okay. And where are you all from? Oaks? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1712.0s)]
*  And what are your names? Kim and Michael. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1719.2s)]
*  So you said you haven't really been following the election much at all. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1723.7600000000002s)]
*  What do you know to the extent that you know anything? I know that there is Kamala Harris [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1727.0400000000002s)]
*  and I know Donald Trump. And I know the perfect pick. And he knew, so he would pick. Who would [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1734.0s)]
*  you pick? Kamala Harris. Why is that? I don't trust Trump. I just don't trust Trump. I never trusted him. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1740.08s)]
*  What don't you like about Trump in particular? Like, was there anything he did when he was [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1750.8s)]
*  president the first time that you didn't like? No, because I don't think I noticed anything yet. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1753.68s)]
*  I don't know. You were young. You were just born. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1758.64s)]
*  How old are you? Nine. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1762.8000000000002s)]
*  Okay. So you were just... I was born in 2015. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1765.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. So right at the end of Obama and then Trump came in. And what do you like about Kamala? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1768.24s)]
*  If anything. I don't know. I just don't... [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1776.24s)]
*  You just like her as an alternative to Trump. Yes. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1779.44s)]
*  And you just haven't been following it? I just haven't really been following. I [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1783.44s)]
*  didn't have any problems when Trump was in. I thought he was fine before. But I don't really [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1787.36s)]
*  know who's doing what this year. Like who's... What everybody's talking about. I just really [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  don't keep up with him. Have you voted in the past? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1799.04s)]
*  I have not ever. Never? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1800.56s)]
*  Never in my life. And why? You just don't think that there's enough at stake for you to... [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1802.08s)]
*  It's not that. It's just... I just never have. I really never have. But if I had to pick one, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  I would go back with Trump. Just because he did fine before. I just think I would choose him. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1813.84s)]
*  That's it. And what do you think of Kamala Harris? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1820.72s)]
*  I mean, to the extent that you've heard anything? From what I... She just seems funny to me. I don't [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1824.32s)]
*  know. She just seems like a shoo-in. I kind of think Donald knows what he's doing. He's been [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1829.6s)]
*  there. He's got experience with this stuff. I kind of think they're just trying to fit Kamala in for [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1836.0s)]
*  like, she's a woman. She's this. She's that. You know what I mean? I just think if I had to choose, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1840.32s)]
*  if you were to pick one right now, it would be Trump. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1845.76s)]
*  Well, they just switched Kamala into the nomination over Biden without her having even to get any [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1848.16s)]
*  votes in the primary. So you're sort of right in what you say. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1853.68s)]
*  Like the world is gung-ho on, you know, get a woman and do this. I just think they need to sit [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1856.96s)]
*  back and think who really could run our country the best. And I would go with Trump. He was there. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1862.88s)]
*  He's done it. So do you think you will vote or you won't bother? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1868.4s)]
*  No. He might if he could, but he can't because he's not old enough. But no, if I would, it would be [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1872.0800000000002s)]
*  for... Who is he going to vote for? I don't know yet, actually. He hasn't told us. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1878.88s)]
*  What, really? It's a big secret. It's a big secret. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1884.24s)]
*  So... Who do you think will win regardless of who you would prefer? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1890.64s)]
*  Trump. Why is that? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1894.24s)]
*  I just... Well, I don't actually, I don't know, because it seems like a lot of people [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1896.48s)]
*  are against him right now because they saw what he did the first time. But [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1901.1200000000001s)]
*  I still think Trump will win. Because I still think some people are like maybe skeptical about [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1908.5600000000002s)]
*  having a woman president. So I just think maybe Trump is going to do better. I like him. I would [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1915.52s)]
*  choose him. My two cousins are picking for Trump because they told me that he made a song of... [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1923.12s)]
*  He said, they're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. I'm like, what? I'm like, huh? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1932.3999999999999s)]
*  No, my cousin seemed to me... Jackson and Jacob, they seemed to me... [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1943.4399999999998s)]
*  On like TikTok or something like that? I don't know. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1948.7199999999998s)]
*  Yes. And they're voting for Trump because they like the song? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1953.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know. Probably. Probably. Probably not. Probably. Probably not. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1957.36s)]
*  You hate both candidates, but you are going to vote. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1964.2399999999998s)]
*  Yes. Why do you dislike both candidates? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1967.36s)]
*  They both have poor... Well, first, her... [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1971.6s)]
*  Kamala, she's already in the second position currently. So all the stuff she's going to do [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1976.32s)]
*  or whatever she says, why isn't it being done now? And the other guy, Trump, he doesn't take [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1984.3999999999999s)]
*  ownership of anything he says. And he's lots of lies here and there. But I think he's more [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=1993.1999999999998s)]
*  better for the people than her because she's in a position right now. We want change. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2001.2s)]
*  Why are we going to stick with the same stuff that's going on? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2009.04s)]
*  Did you vote for Trump in the prior elections? Yes. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2012.08s)]
*  Did you have the same attitude toward him then or has it gotten worse or better? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2016.0s)]
*  Worse. I voted for him because I didn't think he could be bought because he had money. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2019.8400000000001s)]
*  He can't do anything because he's got money. But now he goes around to the same sort of donors [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2025.92s)]
*  and what have you. Yeah. They're both horrible, but there's only two choices. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2032.72s)]
*  And what do you think about the international situation? We have a big war in the Middle East, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2039.2s)]
*  Eastern Europe. Do you think Trump would be an improvement for those situations? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2044.6399999999999s)]
*  I think you have to focus on our country. Stop giving all our money to Trump. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2048.56s)]
*  We have to focus on our country. Stop giving all our money out to other countries. I know [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2052.88s)]
*  there's other stuff going on, reasons why you're giving it to them, but they should put that money [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2057.2000000000003s)]
*  into this country and the people here. So you wouldn't want any more money to be [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2063.2000000000003s)]
*  given to Israel or Ukraine or anything like that? No. No. Put it into the people here [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2067.52s)]
*  and the United States here. Help the people here. Who do you think is going to win regardless of [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  what your preference is? No clue. It's a coin flip out there. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2079.12s)]
*  I agree with you. Where are you from? Philadelphia originally, but I'm in Maryland now. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2085.44s)]
*  So you're voting in Maryland? Yes. And what's your name? Brian. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2092.16s)]
*  All right. Really appreciate it. Thank you. So what are your thoughts on the election at this point? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2096.48s)]
*  I'm actually a little nervous, but I'm excited to be able to vote. And I'm really happy that my kids [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2100.72s)]
*  are voting as well. So I've been talking a lot about it. A little annoyed by all of the, you know, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2105.52s)]
*  text messages and reminders, reminders, reminders. However, I know it's necessary because some people [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2111.04s)]
*  still don't know what they're doing, which I don't even understand it just late in the game, how you [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2115.7599999999998s)]
*  don't know what you're doing. You'd be surprised how many people that we talk to who are undecided, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2119.68s)]
*  don't know if they're going to vote. Why do you think that is? Because people want a perfect [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2124.72s)]
*  candidate, number one, and people also don't understand the role of the president. They think [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2129.36s)]
*  the president is going to fix every problem that they have, but there's some responsibility on us [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2134.0s)]
*  as citizens as well. So who are you voting for? I'm voting for Kamala Harris. I'm voting for Kamala [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2137.6s)]
*  Harris because I think that she's concerned about all of the people. Don't get me wrong. I don't [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2143.28s)]
*  agree with every single thing that any candidate has to say or do, but I do feel as though her [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2147.12s)]
*  policies are going to cover the majority of the American people. I think that the landscape of [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2151.28s)]
*  America is very different, and I would like to make sure that every person is represented. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2156.24s)]
*  And what fears do you have, if any, about Trump getting back in? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2160.64s)]
*  Don't make me faint against this wall. Please don't make me faint. Seriously, I'm a health [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2167.92s)]
*  care provider, so one of the things that concerns me is that his agenda does not include all the [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2173.2s)]
*  people. It doesn't include poor people. It doesn't include disenfranchised people. It doesn't include [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2178.64s)]
*  immigrants, people who are seeking to find a way to find citizenship in our country. Every last one [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2183.3599999999997s)]
*  of us are coming from somewhere else. The only people who've been here before are the people who [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2188.56s)]
*  are native to this land. Our people were imported. Some people came over as immigrants in all different [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2193.52s)]
*  kinds of ways, and I think that there should be a clear pathway for citizenship. And just to hear [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2198.08s)]
*  the rhetoric and the strong tones that he uses against people, I don't think that that's good [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2202.96s)]
*  for the country. I think that it promotes division, and I don't really want to be a part of that. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2208.0s)]
*  Do you think Kamala has run a good campaign? I think she's done an excellent job, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2212.72s)]
*  especially in the amount of time that she had to even try to come up with policies [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2216.88s)]
*  that are similar to but still different than the job and the role that she has right now. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2220.56s)]
*  What are some differences between her and Biden? Well, I think that Kamala is a little bit more [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2226.32s)]
*  liberal, personally. I think that she's more liberal than he is. In what areas? I think that [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2231.28s)]
*  she's more liberal when it comes to just like people who are different. I don't think that [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2236.2400000000002s)]
*  Dr. Biden, I tell you, I work in healthcare. Everybody's a doctor, right? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2244.48s)]
*  Exactly right. I think that Biden, although he wanted to do a lot for different people, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2250.48s)]
*  which I agree that he has done, I think that Kamala wants to take it a little bit further. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2256.0s)]
*  That's all. And what about foreign policy issues? Like there's been a huge war in the Middle East [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2259.28s)]
*  for the past year, war in Eastern Europe. Do you think the Biden-Harris administration has done [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  a good job with that stuff? I think for what I know, because again, you can't come to my job [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2273.6s)]
*  and tell me how to do my job. I'm not trying to tell the president or vice president how to do [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2279.7599999999998s)]
*  their job. What I do think is that they have done a good job. I think that they have been on the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2283.44s)]
*  ground and they have been working really, really hard to bring peace to the nation, but it's not [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2288.48s)]
*  their responsibility to bring peace to foreign lands. It's their responsibility in my respect [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2293.2s)]
*  as Americans. We are the holders of democracy. I think that democracy is done well here when we [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2298.88s)]
*  do it well. And I think that we should be the champions for democracy, definitely. But it's [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2304.2400000000002s)]
*  up to individual countries to figure out. The U.S. does have responsibility when they [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2308.4s)]
*  send weapons to Israel, for example, or to Ukraine. That's a matter of U.S. foreign policy. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2312.8s)]
*  So that is something that is within the purview of the president. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2318.4s)]
*  I agree that that's within his purview, but I also feel as though he doesn't make peace happen. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2321.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think that any president of the United States is going to make peace happen somewhere else. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2327.12s)]
*  I did want to ask you, there's talk about how black men in particular are getting more supportive [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2332.56s)]
*  of Trump. Now, who knows whether that will turn out to be true, but you see some polling that [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2338.0s)]
*  might suggest that he's making a lot of appeals to mostly black men, not so much black women. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2342.64s)]
*  Have you observed that? What do you make of that? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2348.08s)]
*  I don't spend a lot of time around black men, not just because I work a lot and I'm home a lot [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2351.28s)]
*  or whatever, so I don't spend a lot of time around a variety of black men. I'll say it that way. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2358.56s)]
*  But I've not spoken to any black man who's working for Donald Trump. That's all I'm saying. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2362.4s)]
*  And what do you think is going to happen? Who's going to win regardless of what you might prefer? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2369.04s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2374.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2375.12s)]
*  I'm Tony. Tony Joseph. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2378.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm from Philadelphia. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2381.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2383.2799999999997s)]
*  You're welcome. Thank you. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2384.24s)]
*  Hashimo Moody. And as far as the candidates go, I don't find any [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2386.0s)]
*  tangible things that they're going to be doing for my community, so I won't be voting for either one. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2394.24s)]
*  I think that the country's been thoroughly divided, and we've been put in a state of [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2399.84s)]
*  choosing between a rattlesnake and a cobra. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2408.56s)]
*  Where are you guys from? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2414.88s)]
*  Delaware. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2416.4s)]
*  And you have a similar opinion? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2418.8s)]
*  Very similar. In light of Kamala, particularly, really most of the support [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2422.0800000000004s)]
*  was going to be going to Biden, so by default she's there. So she's just kind of the lesser [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2430.88s)]
*  of the two evils as far as what I can see in this particular election. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2435.28s)]
*  So you don't plan to vote at all? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2440.2400000000002s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2442.0s)]
*  Have you voted in the past? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2443.0400000000004s)]
*  I have voted. I voted for Obama. I voted for Clinton and other candidates. But really, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2444.4s)]
*  honestly, after Obama's second term, I really honestly don't see any substantive difference, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2450.72s)]
*  no matter who's in office, for myself particularly, or my community. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2457.12s)]
*  So that's where. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2460.72s)]
*  And where in Delaware are you from? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2462.56s)]
*  Wilmington. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2464.56s)]
*  And what do you expect to happen if Trump were to win? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2466.24s)]
*  I think it'll be similar to 2016. I think a lot of people are making him out to be this big bad wolf, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2473.6s)]
*  but ultimately when you're talking about the president, you're talking about a [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2480.48s)]
*  person who's literally just a figurehead. They don't really control what's really happening in [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  the government. Most people really don't understand that. So I don't think it'll be any different than [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2490.4s)]
*  2016 when he was president. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2494.56s)]
*  So some people will try to argue that Trump is such a massive threat, that he's going to [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2497.6000000000004s)]
*  destroy democracy, that he's going to bring some kind of tyranny, that everybody needs to vote [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2502.08s)]
*  against me if we don't support who he's running against necessarily. But you don't buy into that. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2506.16s)]
*  Those are scare tactics, in my opinion. He doesn't have enough power to overthrow democracy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2510.8799999999997s)]
*  He's only going to be allowed to do what they tell him to do. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2515.92s)]
*  What do you think of that argument? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2519.92s)]
*  Yeah, I concur 100 percent of me. It's not as like as if he's a monarch or a king and he can just [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2521.92s)]
*  decree a thing and it is. So it's only so much he's going to be able to do. And I do think a [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2527.8399999999997s)]
*  lot of things that you're saying in media right now are simply scare tactics for whatever reason. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2531.68s)]
*  If you had to choose between the two of them, let's say gun to your head or hypothetically, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2537.12s)]
*  who would you would you have a preference or? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2542.3199999999997s)]
*  Or no. If I had to gun to my head because of certain spiritual beliefs I have, I don't stand [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2545.2s)]
*  for abortion at all. I would just have to go Kamala on that basis. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2552.24s)]
*  Since you don't support- [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  With Trump, I'm sorry. Trump, yeah. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2559.04s)]
*  Gun to my head, I would have to go with Kamala and that's because of I believe Trump does have [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2562.16s)]
*  a whole lot of racist ties. I don't think it's a coincidence that every white supremacist and white [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2571.12s)]
*  nationalist group supports Trump. So they know who he is a lot better than a lot of us do. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2576.8799999999997s)]
*  So being a black man in this country, I could not vote against my own personal [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2582.56s)]
*  interest to vote for somebody like him, although I would not vote for Kamala either. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2586.8s)]
*  And what was your name? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2595.28s)]
*  Raheed. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2596.48s)]
*  What's your last name? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2597.6000000000004s)]
*  Moody. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2598.48s)]
*  Moody? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2599.6000000000004s)]
*  Moody, yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2600.1000000000004s)]
*  All right, thanks gentlemen. Really appreciate it. I'm voting the same way as you guys, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2601.2000000000003s)]
*  meaning I'm not voting for either. So I was always refreshing to run into somebody with that same [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2604.5600000000004s)]
*  perspective. Oh, one more question. So in terms of foreign policy, we have a major war in the [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2608.6400000000003s)]
*  Middle East that's been going for a year, war in Ukraine. What do you see as the Biden-Harris [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2614.4s)]
*  record being in those areas? And do you think Trump would be an improvement? Would he be even [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2622.0s)]
*  worse? What do you make of that? Trump has more experience than Kamala Harris, but from what I've [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2626.88s)]
*  seen of him, he's very keen on war and throwing his power around. So I wouldn't necessarily feel [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2635.52s)]
*  safe with him simply because of that. I think we would definitely be in a lot more wars with him [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d31rdO-W_s&t=2643.84s)]
