# Is Russia an Authoritarian Regime?: Glenn Asks Russian Analyst Aleksandr Dugin in Moscow
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ)
*  Let me ask about the motive at play in this agenda that you're describing as the globalist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  agenda to impose what they describe as liberal democracy on other countries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=12.96s)]
*  If you go back to the Obama years, where I think a lot of the U.S. Russian hostility [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  began with the Hillary Clinton State Department and through the years, obviously the United [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=23.88s)]
*  States is perfectly happy to partner with and deal with and even impose very dictatorial [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=29.98s)]
*  regimes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=38.82s)]
*  When there were protests in Egypt for democracy by the students, the Mubarak government was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=40.46s)]
*  very close to the United States. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=44.74s)]
*  Hillary Clinton talked about Prime Minister, President, and Mrs. Mubarak being very close [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=46.82s)]
*  friends of her family in Saudi Arabia and all around the world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=50.7s)]
*  The United States is partnered with and been very happy with dictatorial regimes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=55.18s)]
*  So when there's this effort to use these agencies to change the government of Russia, to change [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=59.18s)]
*  the political climate in Eastern Europe and the like, it doesn't seem to me like the motive [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=65.82s)]
*  is, oh, they want to just spread democracy because they love freedom. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  What do you think the motive is and why there's been this effort to try and undermine stability [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=74.68s)]
*  in other governments in the region, including your own? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=79.3s)]
*  So first of all, I think that that was a kind... [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=82.5s)]
*  There are two lines, two schools and international relations, as for sure you know, realism and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=85.98s)]
*  liberalism. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  According to realism and international relations, you can deal with any government if they are [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  willing to... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=102.22s)]
*  Any government if it is willing to cooperate with you, to follow your line, to support [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  you, you just discount whether they are dictatorial, authoritarian, democratic, liberal, socialist, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=111.26s)]
*  communist, secondary importance. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=120.7s)]
*  That is realism. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  So you should follow your national interests and all the rest is of secondary importance. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  That was the position of Kissinger, the position of John Mearsheimer. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=134.62s)]
*  That is classical realism and international relations. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=138.5s)]
*  And partly United States is based on this line, on this school. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=142.14s)]
*  So what is good for America, it's acceptable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=148.3s)]
*  So if... [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=153.58s)]
*  Democracy or authoritarianism doesn't matter. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=154.58s)]
*  Yeah, it does not matter. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=156.62s)]
*  Liberalism and international relations, it is totally different system. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=158.9s)]
*  So that is idea that you should fight authoritarianism in any country, including United States, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=163.26s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=173.34s)]
*  So nobody is perfect. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=174.34s)]
*  So we need to make democracy more functional, more equal, more tolerance, more work in some [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  sense. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=188.34s)]
*  Starting from those regime that are openly not so liberal or they are called such. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=189.5s)]
*  So that is the kind of different angle. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=198.46s)]
*  Mubarak was the friend of United States and of Israel, nothing against them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=202.86s)]
*  But at the same time, he was openly authoritarian. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=209.62s)]
*  Like General Sussie now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=213.22s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=214.62s)]
*  There is no big difference. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=215.62s)]
*  They belong to different ideological camp, but the methods they use in the rule, they [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=218.5s)]
*  are more or less similar. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=226.02s)]
*  So liberalism and international relations, that is globalism and left liberalism, as [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=228.06s)]
*  they call it now in the US. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  So that is totally different approach to the international affairs. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=237.94s)]
*  And in that sense, Russia represents a kind of independent civilizational state with different [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=244.0s)]
*  political philosophy, with different values. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=251.0s)]
*  For us in our eyes, they are democratic. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=255.72s)]
*  But in the eyes of globalists, they are authoritarian. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  So the idea to overthrow a Russian political system fits perfectly in these liberalism [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  and international relations, the same with Middle East, the Islamic States. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=272.16s)]
*  And these schools normally during the last hundred years in the United States, they competed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  They were more or less in balance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  So one step in realistic way, the other in liberal, and they cooperated somehow. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  After the fall of the Soviet Union, the liberals in the international relations, they have [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  won because they, according to Fukuyama, they have remarked that now it is the moment of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  unipolarities. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=312.12s)]
*  So all the world should turn into democracy, liberal democracy, no more realism, no more [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=313.12s)]
*  national state. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=319.88s)]
*  We need to destroy that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=320.88s)]
*  We need to come to global government. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=322.36s)]
*  That is normal part of the manuals of international relations in this section about, dedicated [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=324.2s)]
*  to liberalism in international relations. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=330.92s)]
*  That is not conspiracy theory. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=333.8s)]
*  World government is a political, sociological concept of liberalism in international relations. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  And that was the kind of this balancing move to concentrate everything on this global liberal [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=343.28s)]
*  approach. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think that that was the loss of the balance. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  And Trump is restoring that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=359.56s)]
*  So he is not against liberal democracy, but he is against a realist attitude to the world's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=362.72s)]
*  politics. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  That is the US's responsibility or role to change other governments that he's rejecting. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=371.52000000000004s)]
*  Let me ask you though, on this scale that you just described of liberal democracies [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=376.76s)]
*  on the one hand and authoritarian regimes on the other, prior to the fall of the Soviet [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=383.2s)]
*  Union, all Americans were raised, taught. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=387.52s)]
*  The Soviet Union is on the extreme end of authoritarianism. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=391.12s)]
*  There's no elections. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=394.28s)]
*  There's no free speech. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=395.28s)]
*  If you criticize the government, you go to jail. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=396.28s)]
*  All of the things were taught. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=398.32s)]
*  And after the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Yeltsin and a certain change in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  the relationship between the United States and Russia for a while, there was this sense [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=406.76s)]
*  that Russia is becoming more western. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=410.24s)]
*  There's more democratic reform now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  And now we're very much back to the same perspective of Russia and the West that we had prior to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=415.0s)]
*  the fall of the Soviet Union. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=420.0s)]
*  It's an authoritarian regime. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=421.0s)]
*  There were no real elections. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=422.8s)]
*  People who criticize the government go to prison. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=424.24s)]
*  There was a crackdown on individual rights and the like. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=428.4s)]
*  In the terms, the ideas that you just used to describe the perspective of the United [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=431.08s)]
*  States, liberal democracies here, authoritarian governments here, is it fair to consider Russia [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=437.28s)]
*  more toward the authoritarian pole? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=443.12s)]
*  So I think that when the United States dealt with the Soviet Union, that was the path of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=445.72s)]
*  ideological propaganda. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=454.04s)]
*  There were two systems competing on the global scale and blaming each other to be manipulated [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  by big finance or to be authoritarian, totalitarian. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=466.4s)]
*  So that was the path of the ideological weaponry of the Cold War. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=472.52s)]
*  And there was some sense in that because the zone of Soviet influence was so big. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=479.56s)]
*  So we influenced some states in Latin America, some political parties in Europe and in Asia. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=489.68s)]
*  So we compete on the global level. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=501.52s)]
*  And we blamed each other. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=505.12s)]
*  We competed on the global level and we blamed each other to be something bad in our eyes. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=509.44s)]
*  In the Soviet ideology, capitalism is bad because that is exploitation and all that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=516.12s)]
*  In the capitalist camp, socialism was totalitarian and bad. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=522.48s)]
*  That was not about the truth. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=528.84s)]
*  That was about ideology. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=531.4s)]
*  Now, when the Soviet pole collapsed, there was only one ideology, liberalism, that has [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=533.84s)]
*  won on the planetarium scale. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  And Huntington has seen very, very correctly from the beginning of the 90s that after the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=547.0s)]
*  collapse of two ideological camps, there will be new actors, civilizations. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=555.04s)]
*  They will return. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=563.28s)]
*  They will emerge. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=564.28s)]
*  And they will not form an anti-Western pole or something like Soviet system, but they [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=567.56s)]
*  will try to defend their identities. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=574.8s)]
*  They simply don't coincide with Western ones. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=578.5999999999999s)]
*  So there we need to make a translation of the terms. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=583.64s)]
*  So we could not reduce all the situation to authoritarian, whether authoritarian or liberal [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=586.6999999999999s)]
*  democracy. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=594.0s)]
*  So that is absolutely the violence against the differences of cultures, terms. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=596.08s)]
*  For example, in our opinion, we could have democratic authoritarianism, something like [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=603.74s)]
*  Because if we choose by our free will someone who will be considered as a father of nation [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=611.5200000000001s)]
*  or authoritarian figure, the father... [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of people who think the United States has that now with Donald Trump, for [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=622.6800000000001s)]
*  example. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=625.88s)]
*  You are experiencing exactly the same dilemma, the same question. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=626.88s)]
*  You could, by all your free will, you could prefer something that should not be globalist, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=634.2s)]
*  liberal, democratic, and maybe it could seem as well as authoritarian. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=643.4000000000001s)]
*  These all monuments, big monuments of Trump already down. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  So we passed all our history making huge monuments for our leaders. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=654.0s)]
*  So that was not the case in the living leaders. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=661.44s)]
*  That was not the case of political philosophy, political tradition in the United States. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=666.6s)]
*  And now with Trump, you have arrived immediately. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  In some months, you have arrived to the same conclusion that maybe, maybe people, the society, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  the masses would prefer a strong leader, strong authoritarian leader with extra capacity [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=683.0s)]
*  and a special, special right to change the situation that you consider to be in pitiful [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=691.24s)]
*  conditions. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=698.16s)]
*  So that is the same logic. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=699.16s)]
*  So maybe you understand us much better now because you have one of the first experience [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=700.76s)]
*  of how great and how beautiful some kind of democratic authoritarianism could be. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=709.36s)]
*  But I guess the one difference is that the reason Donald Trump is in power, and presumably [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=717.28s)]
*  in another 18 months or so, there will be a Congress in place as a result as well, is [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=725.48s)]
*  that he won a free election. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=732.12s)]
*  The Democrats tried to put him in prison. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=735.24s)]
*  Democrats tried to have him ineligible to even run on the ballot, but they failed. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=737.24s)]
*  He was able to run. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=741.9599999999999s)]
*  And by all accounts, there was a free election and he was chosen. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=742.9599999999999s)]
*  Presumably there will be another one of those in 18 months for the Congress and another [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=747.12s)]
*  one of those in three and a half years for the next president. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=749.76s)]
*  Whereas I think this argument is that, well, in Russia, you can say that people want a [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=754.8399999999999s)]
*  democratic authoritarianism, but there's no real elections and therefore it's not really [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  comparable to the United States. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=765.3s)]
*  What about that argument? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=766.8599999999999s)]
*  So first of all, I think that the Democrats wanted to rig elections and seal elections [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=768.5s)]
*  from Trump precisely because they were afraid that something like that could happen in the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=775.62s)]
*  United States because the will of the people could be different from the understanding [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=785.3399999999999s)]
*  of how democracy should work according to some abstract liberal democratic concepts. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=791.9s)]
*  So and they started, they started, I have remarked once, Biden has said that the freedom [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=799.3s)]
*  is more important than democracy. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=806.6999999999999s)]
*  So you can rig democracy if your freedom is endangered. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=810.98s)]
*  So there is inner paradox because the people having free election can vote to someone who [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=815.02s)]
*  can be considered by abstract liberal theorists as something that authoritarian, something [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=829.18s)]
*  that isn't exactly that someone for someone who doesn't fit exactly with their understanding [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=840.7s)]
*  of how democracy should be, not how it is. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=848.0200000000001s)]
*  And so democracy that could prefer to a strong leader and weak democratic government. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=852.3000000000001s)]
*  It is historical fact that the things like that happened in the history. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  And liberals are very, very afraid of such possibility and free elections. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=867.82s)]
*  In your case, in the United States, only in the case of Europe, it is this open possibility [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=875.94s)]
*  to choose whoever you want and not what the globalists suggest that you should, or what [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=881.86s)]
*  should elect. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=890.38s)]
*  So that is some contradiction. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=891.38s)]
*  So embedded in the democracy itself. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=894.46s)]
*  So democracy could in some situation, as was the passage from the Roman Republic to the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=897.7s)]
*  Roman Empire, when Republican government was so corrupt, incapable to solve the concrete [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=905.34s)]
*  economic geopolitical military problem and respond to the challenges that there was the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=914.6600000000001s)]
*  the popular need to change the type of government from passage from a republic to the empire. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=921.9s)]
*  I think something like that is going now on the list. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=928.18s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=931.18s)]
*  And obviously you see in the United Kingdom where they voted to leave the EU despite being [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=932.18s)]
*  told by what you might call the globalists that they shouldn't, you see the rise of a [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=938.1s)]
*  lot of parties. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=941.02s)]
*  Just yesterday in Germany, the AFD is now the second most popular party. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=942.8199999999999s)]
*  In France and all over Europe, you see the same thing with the rise of populist parties, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=948.1s)]
*  what you might call more nationalist parties, anti-globalist parties. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=952.34s)]
*  But I think the argument there is, let's say there is a decision to move in what one might [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=956.02s)]
*  call a more authoritarian direction or a less liberal direction, that there will be ongoing [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=961.26s)]
*  democratic ratification of that as long as you're holding free and fair elections every [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=967.14s)]
*  four years. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=972.86s)]
*  And that would still be a difference, a lot of critics of your country would say, than [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=974.7s)]
*  what happens here in Russia because here in Russia you may think there's satisfaction [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=979.1s)]
*  with that system but you don't really have free and fair elections to test it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=983.34s)]
*  Is that something that is a fair critique of Russia? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=987.82s)]
*  Is it accurate? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=990.4200000000001s)]
*  And do you think there should be that kind of ratification occasionally? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=991.4200000000001s)]
*  So first of all, I don't think that everything could be reduced to this dilemma, democratic [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=994.98s)]
*  system or authoritarian. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1002.7s)]
*  There are much more versions of the political structures than these two oppositions. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1005.86s)]
*  Second, if we consider, for example, Russian elections as they are now, when the people [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1013.82s)]
*  voting for Putin, if you have Trump at the head of the United States, if you have, let [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1022.6600000000001s)]
*  us imagine, IFD at the head of Germany, Marine Le Pen at the head of France, absolutely democratically [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1032.02s)]
*  elected, and there is no globalist lobby ruling the West. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1041.98s)]
*  So how do you think would they recognize Russian elections as fair, democratic, totally transparent [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1048.74s)]
*  and accountable? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1058.62s)]
*  So I have a feeling that yes, they would say, they would prove, because they are, because [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1059.78s)]
*  it is against the logic of globalists, but the people could choose and still and continue [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1067.8999999999999s)]
*  to support someone they have elected as a kind of father of nation and repeat that for [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1075.94s)]
*  four years. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1085.46s)]
*  But you would need alternatives that they are able to, not just controlled ones, but [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1086.46s)]
*  free ones. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1090.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1091.58s)]
*  Why we should have alternatives? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1092.58s)]
*  If we are happy with what we have. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1093.58s)]
*  But how do you know people are happy unless they are able to express that? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1096.54s)]
*  For example, referendum voting and they are happy, is still happy and still happy. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1099.74s)]
*  There is no alternative and that could last as long as you want. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1105.22s)]
*  You believe in your leader, in your father, father of nation, so much that you will follow [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1111.46s)]
*  his indication of the successor. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1121.54s)]
*  So he, for example, Putin would say, this guy will continue my line. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1123.98s)]
*  He know better than us and we are going to believe. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1128.62s)]
*  And what for this? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1131.62s)]
*  That without alternatives. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1133.22s)]
*  So sometimes alternatives are important, but sometimes no. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1135.18s)]
*  They could be, for example, if there is some collapse of the authority of some leadership, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1141.4599999999998s)]
*  they could be different way to overthrow it or by votes in democratic ways or not. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1150.34s)]
*  There are different ways. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1158.02s)]
*  But if there is the radical discontent of the ruling leader, ruling figure, always there [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1160.9s)]
*  are ways to finish with it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1171.8200000000002s)]
*  So that was... [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1176.18s)]
*  I guess Russian history has examples. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1177.18s)]
*  American history has examples. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1179.2600000000002s)]
*  European, African, Asian. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1180.8200000000002s)]
*  That is kind of eternal. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1183.46s)]
*  Questions and Machiavelli has said if there is the ruler who is living ruler, he is good [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1186.5s)]
*  ruler, because the bad ruler is dead. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPlnJhcQUQ&t=1194.3400000000001s)]
