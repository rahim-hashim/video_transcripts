# Prof. John Mearsheimer: Why Israel's War Against Iran BACKFIRED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc)
*  I, of course, understand that Israel, I'm sure, has a part of their kind of national [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=0.0s)]
*  psyche that views the Iranians as their gravest threat and obviously doesn't want them to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=13.96s)]
*  have nuclear weapons in part out of fear that they're going to use it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=19.56s)]
*  But I think the bigger fear in both Israel and the United States about Iran getting nuclear [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=22.92s)]
*  weapons is that if Iran became a nuclear state, Israel would no longer be able to completely [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  dominate the region as they've been doing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=35.64s)]
*  I mean, we've seen over the last few years, not just Gaza, not just the West Bank, they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=37.36s)]
*  just bombed Syria again this week. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=42.08s)]
*  They took credit for the regime change there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=44.2s)]
*  They took land from Lebanon and bombed, obviously, Lebanon repeatedly over the last several years. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=45.92s)]
*  They bombed Yemen and now they just bombed Iran. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=52.04s)]
*  So basically, they could do whatever they want because of their military superiority. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=55.6s)]
*  It's been the policy of Washington to ensure that Israel maintains military superiority [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  in that region. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=65.64s)]
*  So is that, I get the concern about Iran having nuclear weapons because they might use them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=67.0s)]
*  You know, you want to have fewer rather than more countries having nuclear weapons, I guess. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=71.48s)]
*  But isn't the bigger fear that if Iran gets them, Israel would lose its ability to just [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=76.0s)]
*  bully the entire region and ultimately control the entire region as well? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=81.48s)]
*  Well, I think there's no question that Israel is in a position militarily now where it can [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=87.04s)]
*  act as a bully in the region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=93.2s)]
*  And we don't want to underestimate the importance of Israel's alliance with the United States. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the two of them act as a tag team in the region, and that's a huge force multiplier [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  for the Israelis. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=107.16s)]
*  I have a slightly different view of this than you do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=108.76s)]
*  And I believe that if you go back to the period after Israel was created, the Israelis have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  had a deep-seated interest in basically wrecking all of their Arab neighbors. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=120.76s)]
*  What's happening now to Syria or what's happened to Syria over the past year and a half is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=127.76s)]
*  what the Israelis would like to do to Iran. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=133.24s)]
*  They want to fracture their neighbors, break them apart if possible. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=137.32s)]
*  When the Israelis talk about regime change in Iran, they're talking about more than regime [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=143.44s)]
*  change. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=148.04s)]
*  They want to break Iran into constituent parts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=149.04s)]
*  The Israelis, for example, have had a deep-seated interest in creating a Kurdish state. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  And I've always wondered why the Israelis were interested in creating a Kurdish state [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  and paying so much attention to Kurdish nationalism. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=163.16s)]
*  It's because if you created a Kurdish state, you would break apart Iraq, Iran, Syria, and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=166.72s)]
*  even Turkey. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=172.16s)]
*  And this has long been their goal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=173.68s)]
*  It's a divide-and-conquer policy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=176.16s)]
*  So I think it's just important to understand that they do want to be the most powerful [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=179.04s)]
*  state in the region, as you were alluding to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=183.68s)]
*  But it's more than that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=187.32s)]
*  They believe that the way to do that is to be joined at the hip with the United States, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=188.74s)]
*  Number one. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=193.44s)]
*  Number two, be the only state in the region that has nuclear weapons. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=194.44s)]
*  Number three, be by far the most powerful conventional force in the region. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=198.14s)]
*  And number four, break apart their rivals or put their rivals in a position where they're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=203.68s)]
*  heavily dependent on the United States. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=211.44s)]
*  This is what they've done with Jordan and with Egypt. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=214.16s)]
*  Jordan and Egypt have hardly any maneuver room vis-a-vis Israel because they're economically [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=217.0s)]
*  dependent on Uncle Sam. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=222.44s)]
*  And Uncle Sam has told them that if they challenge Israel in any way, the United States will [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=224.12s)]
*  make them pay economically. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=230.8s)]
*  So that's how you deal with Egypt and Jordan and with countries like Syria, countries like [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=234.12s)]
*  Lebanon, countries like Iran, countries like Iraq. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=238.68s)]
*  The basic goal there is to break those countries, to break them apart, to make them dysfunctional. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=242.24s)]
*  And that's the second goal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=249.14s)]
*  That's the regime change goal when you dig down deep. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=251.96s)]
*  So let me ask you about that then. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=256.72s)]
*  Was there a word there significant advances made in this bombing campaign that was pretty [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=261.16s)]
*  intense and pretty heavy in Iran, principally by Israel but also by the United States, in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=267.72s)]
*  terms of destabilizing and wrecking that country? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  Or do you think the government of Iran emerges still pretty strong and very difficult to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=278.4s)]
*  dislodge people and trying to dislodge them for 45 years, since 1979, and they haven't [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=284.32s)]
*  gone anywhere? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  How do you see their strength and whether they've been sufficiently weakened and destabilized? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=291.4s)]
*  All the evidence, Glenn, is that the bombing campaign by Israel against Iran, which started [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=299.28s)]
*  of course on June 13th, has had exactly the opposite effect in terms of the leadership [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=307.12s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=315.4s)]
*  The hardliners have taken over. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=318.24s)]
*  The Revolutionary Guards are in control more than they ever were. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  The Ayatollah Khomeini has been weakened because he's been forced to basically go into hiding [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=326.08s)]
*  and he's not in a position where he can command the country in any meaningful way. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=332.52s)]
*  And furthermore, all the evidence is that the people are rallying around the flag. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=337.4s)]
*  And we have a rich history of this happening every time a country launches a bombing campaign [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=343.8s)]
*  against another country for the purposes of regime change. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=349.96s)]
*  We have a rich historical record here, and there is not a single instance, I want to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=353.2s)]
*  emphasize, not a single instance where bombing from the air alone has caused regime change. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  And all the evidence is that it causes a rally around the flag effect. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=365.16s)]
*  So the idea that the Israelis are going to cause regime change with their air campaign [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=369.92s)]
*  is not a serious argument. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  And if you look at what's happened over the past 12 days, it has not turned out that the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=376.64s)]
*  country is on the verge of regime change. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=383.14s)]
*  If anything, the regime is in a better situation today than it was on June 12th, the day before [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=386.3s)]
*  the campaign started. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  So this is a failure. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=394.14s)]
*  I think if Israelis and other advocates of regime change in Iran heard you say that, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=396.66s)]
*  I've seen them do this before, that they would point to the counter example of Libya where [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=403.26s)]
*  and Netanyahu specifically cited Gaddafi as the model he wanted Iran to follow. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=408.54s)]
*  And hearing that, I go, I think the model we should give to Iran and make them follow [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=413.66s)]
*  was the one Gaddafi followed, which of course led to not just regime change, but him being [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=417.54s)]
*  raped to death on the street by a gang of madmen. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  And there, I think you can make the argument, can't you, that we did actually succeed in [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=427.06s)]
*  destroying the regime solely through a bombing campaign? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=432.12s)]
*  No. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=436.46000000000004s)]
*  What happened there is that you had a ground war, right? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=438.04s)]
*  We didn't have to invade, but we had proxies who had gone to war against Gaddafi. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=442.38s)]
*  And we then came in with air power. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=453.3s)]
*  But here the argument is that you come in with air power, there's no revolution, there's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=456.3s)]
*  no war on the ground, and air power precipitates a revolution. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=461.1s)]
*  That doesn't happen. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=467.84s)]
*  Again, to go back to the Libya case, the revolution had already started, there was, or the rebellion, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=469.58s)]
*  call it what you want, and there was a huge ground war taking place. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=476.3s)]
*  And that's when air power came in. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=480.18s)]
*  And in those sorts of circumstances, you can do it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=482.46000000000004s)]
*  But not in this case. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=485.82s)]
*  I mean, I remember. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=488.06s)]
*  I'm sorry, go ahead. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=489.06s)]
*  No, you want to remember we had to invade Iraq. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=491.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=494.58s)]
*  We could not do regime change in Iraq from the air. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=495.82s)]
*  Otherwise we would have done it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=500.62s)]
*  Remember shock and awe? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=502.26s)]
*  We went in with shock and awe. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=503.42s)]
*  It didn't lead to regime change. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=505.26s)]
*  We had to go in, conquer the country, and then spend months looking for some who's dang. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=506.82s)]
*  Yeah, and I remember the night of the Israeli bombing, or the second night when we heard [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=512.1s)]
*  all these great stories about precise decapitations of the entire Iranian military commander structure [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=516.64s)]
*  that, oh, this was designed to ensure that the Iranians would be so overwhelmed by the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=523.5s)]
*  show of force that they would essentially submit. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=528.86s)]
*  It was the same thing, shock and awe. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  We're going to shock and awe them into submission. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=533.3000000000001s)]
*  And as you noted, that certainly didn't happen. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=535.0200000000001s)]
*  But let me just ask you, in terms of, because one of the concerns I have is that although [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=537.3800000000001s)]
*  this part of the war for the moment has ended, meaning there's no more planes flying or missiles [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=542.4200000000001s)]
*  flying over Iran and killing people and destroying things, I can't believe that regime change [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=546.86s)]
*  is not still very much in the minds of many, many people in Washington and Tel Aviv. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=552.86s)]
*  President Trump today said he didn't want regime change. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=558.66s)]
*  He thinks the chaos that it would cause would be nowhere near worth the price. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=561.12s)]
*  But you certainly have the US and Israel funding various factions. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=567.74s)]
*  You have the MEK, other factions that are loyal to the Mossad or to the CIA or to the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=572.34s)]
*  MI6. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=577.5s)]
*  And I guess my question to you is, compared to Libya, are those significant? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=579.14s)]
*  Are those kinds of militias and proxies capable of fighting a meaningful ground war to bring [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=584.54s)]
*  about regime change if they also have the air cover from Israel and the US? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=589.86s)]
*  Well, the fact is that they have not been able to do it up to now. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=593.86s)]
*  And after what's happened over the past 12 days, the regime has every incentive to crack [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=601.78s)]
*  down on those groups and make sure that they can't cause any trouble. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=609.26s)]
*  Now can I say with 100% certainty that there won't be an uprising in six months or 12 months? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  No, I can't. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=621.42s)]
*  It's very hard to say how this plays out over time inside of Iran. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=622.42s)]
*  But the fact is that there is no evidence now of an uprising. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=628.54s)]
*  And you also have a regime that has powerful incentives to make sure that that remains [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=633.56s)]
*  the case for the foreseeable future. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=639.26s)]
*  So I don't think you're going to get regime change. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=641.9399999999999s)]
*  But Glenn, then the question pops up, what happens if you do get regime change? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=644.9399999999999s)]
*  What's the happy ending here? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  Are you telling me that we're going to get a new regime that is going to say, we don't [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=652.78s)]
*  want nuclear weapons, we don't want to cause Israel or the United States any trouble in [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=658.18s)]
*  the region, and we're going to behave ourself according to the dictates of Israel? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=663.86s)]
*  You think that's going to happen? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=669.26s)]
*  Well, the dream is to get the Shah's son, who was a puppet of the US and Israel, back [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=670.26s)]
*  into power in Iran. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=675.4599999999999s)]
*  He's going to fly from Paris or whatever and be welcomed with open arms by the Iranians. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=676.8199999999999s)]
*  And I think you see him being treated almost as like this, like Juan Guaido, the legitimate [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=681.34s)]
*  president of Iran or the monarch of Iran by multiple Western media outlets. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=687.0600000000001s)]
*  And that clearly is the plan. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=692.02s)]
*  You know, they have that Ahmed Shalabi, too, who was going to take over Iraq and be so [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=693.58s)]
*  welcomed despite not having lived in Iraq for 40 years. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=697.22s)]
*  That is the vision. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=700.02s)]
*  That is the vision. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=701.02s)]
*  And if you believe that, I have a bridge I want to sell you. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=704.38s)]
*  This is not going to happen. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=709.1800000000001s)]
*  I would also point out to you, of course, when the revolution in Iran took place in [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=710.98s)]
*  1979, it was the Shah who was overthrown. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=716.1s)]
*  The Shah had an ambitious nuclear program, and the Shah was committed to acquiring nuclear [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=719.9000000000001s)]
*  weapons. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=726.0200000000001s)]
*  And the reason is that it makes sense from Iran's point of view to have nuclear weapons. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=727.38s)]
*  You know, Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel and former defense minister as well, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=732.74s)]
*  once said that he believed that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons because it made so much sense. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=739.06s)]
*  Just think about that statement. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=747.3399999999999s)]
*  He of course is a very smart man, and he is correct. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=748.9399999999999s)]
*  It makes eminently good sense for Iran to have nuclear weapons. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=752.3s)]
*  I have said on numerous occasions in public that if I had been the Iranian national security [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=756.66s)]
*  advisor, they would have nuclear weapons today. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=763.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, the lesson of the past 12 days is that Iran was foolish not to get nuclear weapons, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=766.18s)]
*  in my opinion. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=772.26s)]
*  And the lesson now is to go out and get nuclear weapons, because if you had nuclear weapons, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=774.18s)]
*  the Israelis and the Americans would not attack you. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=779.4599999999999s)]
*  So I would just say that even if you get the Shah's son in power in Iran, I bet a lot of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=783.5799999999999s)]
*  money that after a short period of time, he'd be very interested in building nuclear weapons [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=791.82s)]
*  because again, it makes good strategic sense. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTzILjAtZAc&t=797.58s)]
