# Steve Bannon: "Boris Johnson is a F*cking War Criminal"
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI)
*  One thing I want to ask you about is we've been interviewing a lot of the international [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=0.0s)]
*  representatives here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=9.26s)]
*  My right wing brethren. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=10.56s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=12.56s)]
*  But the Law and Justice Party in Poland, from which the former prime minister is here, Marewski, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=13.56s)]
*  and the woman who was actually on stage with you last night from the AFD, Christine Anderson. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=19.62s)]
*  AFD, yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=25.28s)]
*  They have some serious ideological problems with one another about Polish allegations [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=27.96s)]
*  that the AFD has a revisionist attitude toward World War II. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=34.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=37.64s)]
*  No, I'm saying, what do you make of that fissure and how do you bridge it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=38.64s)]
*  Can it be bridged? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=43.56s)]
*  Look, populist nationals, we believe in the Westphalian system. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=44.56s)]
*  We believe in every nation is going to have their MAGA move. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=48.6s)]
*  It's going to be different. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=51.64s)]
*  It's going to have its own characteristics, its own house style. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=52.64s)]
*  I think it's great that they have disagreements and they'll try to figure it out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=55.8s)]
*  I'm not in there to say, oh no, you're right and you're wrong. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=59.48s)]
*  I got my own theories about World War II or my study of World War II. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=61.72s)]
*  I'm a huge supporter of AFD. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=65.56s)]
*  I'm a huge supporter of the Polish movement and they'll figure it out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=67.32s)]
*  And I realize in that part of the world, this kind of been the cockpit of the 20th century [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=71.0s)]
*  as far as wars go. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=75.24s)]
*  They have big disagreements, but you're going to see this all over. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=76.24s)]
*  I was Georgia Maloney's biggest backer when she was at 3%. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=79.36s)]
*  We raised her up. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=83.34s)]
*  There's a documentary made about her, I made sure she was in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=84.38000000000001s)]
*  I made a supporter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=86.7s)]
*  She's been a big disappointment in the Ukraine war. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=87.7s)]
*  We have been right about the Ukraine war from the beginning. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=91.06s)]
*  And I warned the people around her and I would go on TV and I'd do interviews in Italy and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  say, we love you, but you got this one really wrong and you're acting too much like a globalist. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=96.9s)]
*  And she's very close to Trump and Trump comes in the last 72 hours and really supports what [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=102.42s)]
*  we've been saying for years about this Ukraine situation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=106.5s)]
*  And I think actually going to find out much more about Ukraine that's going to get people [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  sick to their stomachs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=113.58s)]
*  So those kind of things are happening. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=114.58s)]
*  They're going to happen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=116.3s)]
*  Remember, it's a international and global movement of kind of populist nationalists, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=117.3s)]
*  but it's going to be different all over. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=122.14s)]
*  They have very different attitudes towards Russia too, as you alluded to. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=123.14s)]
*  PIS very hostile toward Russia. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=126.5s)]
*  They invoke the Soviet legacy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=128.98s)]
*  AFD wants more of a reconciliation with Russia, maybe more in line with your preferences. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=131.38s)]
*  But in terms of solving an acute geopolitical issue right now, that's not just some thing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=139.26s)]
*  to kind of argue about in theoretical terms. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=145.02s)]
*  That's a pretty pressing, tangible issue. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=149.74s)]
*  Yeah, I was just saying, so their differences, their attitude toward Russia right now, that's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  not just some theoretical thing to hash out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=161.02s)]
*  That could have implications acutely for the resolution of an ongoing geopolitical issue. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=164.1s)]
*  Yes, it could. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=169.82s)]
*  But I think that's it's got to be worked out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=170.82s)]
*  Those people have two different attitudes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=172.9s)]
*  The Poles have a very different attitude towards the Russians than at least part of the Germans [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=174.26s)]
*  do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  It's one of the things that has to be worked out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  But people ought to understand something. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  The Russian people have been our allies in the great war on the Eurasian landmass in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=183.54s)]
*  the middle of the 20th century. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=189.06s)]
*  The Chinese people, Lao Bai Jing, and the Russian people, not their leaders, they were [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=190.54s)]
*  our allies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=195.14s)]
*  And the Indian people, Indian people down in Burma and in Irrawaddy, the Russians lost, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=196.14s)]
*  I think, 60 million people to the war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=201.18s)]
*  The Chinese lost 30, 35 million. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=204.06s)]
*  If the Russians hadn't taken so many casualties, the Russian army, the Red Army at the time, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=205.89999999999998s)]
*  we would have lost two or three million men in Europe. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  And we didn't. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=212.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=213.1s)]
*  Because they took the brunt of it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=214.1s)]
*  So those people, now we have fucked them over because we gave Stalin too many arms. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=215.1s)]
*  We knew it at the end because the FDR and the State Department was filled with freaking [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=220.12s)]
*  Marxism. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=224.8s)]
*  We know that from the KGB files being opened. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=225.8s)]
*  We turned over in 1949. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=228.24s)]
*  General Marshall turned over China to the Chinese Communist Party, which was still a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  small group of guys up in the mountains as almost bandits. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=233.96s)]
*  We turned it over now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  They had, the Shanghai shack was no date. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  The beach. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  My point is the American people's allies have been the Russian people and have been the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  Chinese people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=246.28s)]
*  OK? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=247.28s)]
*  They have not been the CCP and has certainly not been the KGB. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=248.28s)]
*  The KGB and these guys are bad hombres. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=251.0s)]
*  OK? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=253.08s)]
*  Just like the guys in Beijing are. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=254.08s)]
*  But it doesn't mean the two people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=255.8s)]
*  And the last thing we should have ever allowed to happen, and I preach this, we should have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=256.8s)]
*  never allowed Ukraine to happen. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=260.32s)]
*  Professor Mersheimer is right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=262.36s)]
*  And I'm telling you, Boris Johnson's a fucking war criminal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=264.06s)]
*  OK? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=266.88s)]
*  For him to go over and stick his dick in this thing at the end and unwind everything was [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=267.88s)]
*  going on is a crime. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=271.44s)]
*  I asked Liz Truss about that, who was the foreign minister at the time when Boris Johnson [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=272.64s)]
*  was prime minister. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=276.36s)]
*  And she denied this fairly longstanding allegation that Boris Johnson as an emissary of Biden, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=277.36s)]
*  perhaps kind of blew up those early stage peace negotiations in Istanbul in March, April [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=283.04s)]
*  2022. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  She trust was on your show. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  Has that come up in your discussions at all with her? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=291.36s)]
*  No, because I don't even know if she knew what was going on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  This is a Boris Johnson trying to be Churchill. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  Boris Johnson's a fantasist, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=298.44s)]
*  He's a fan, says he thinks he's embodiment once in Churchill. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=300.52s)]
*  He kept saying this was his moment. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=302.88s)]
*  The damn biographer of Churchill, too, very pompously. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=305.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  So look, we have to face the American people have to face something that's quite, you know, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  all the papers they about about NATO, everything like that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  And I was a naval officer for four years at sea and three years in the Pentagon, three [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=317.68s)]
*  and a half the Pentagon. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=321.64000000000004s)]
*  The virtually all the elites in NATO didn't fight with us in World War Two. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  This is why I think it's quite impressive for President Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  If he goes this year to to victory in Europe Day, there's rumors he might actually go to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=332.86s)]
*  Russia. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=339.14s)]
*  And I don't think it's I don't think it's sitting there and saying you support Putin. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=340.26s)]
*  But it's I think to honor the Russian people and the sacrifice in World War Two that they [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=344.06s)]
*  gave to end World War Two. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  Norway, Sweden was neutral. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  Norway was one of the worst of the Germans. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=352.74s)]
*  Quizzing was terrible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=354.22s)]
*  It was a fascist regime. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=355.22s)]
*  Denmark, terrible. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=357.06s)]
*  Finland was Finland was actually counter-stabbed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=358.06s)]
*  They fought the Soviets at first, right? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ppU4Cn2dI&t=361.42s)]
