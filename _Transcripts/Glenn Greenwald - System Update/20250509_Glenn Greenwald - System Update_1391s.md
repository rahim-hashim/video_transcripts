# What Are Pope Leo XIV's Political Views?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU)
*  Probably this morning, white smoke emitted from the Vatican, which as most of you know, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=0.0s)]
*  signifies that the conclave of cardinals assembled in the Vatican have chosen a new pope. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=11.36s)]
*  And the new pope that they agreed on is the first ever American pope. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=19.0s)]
*  He was born in Chicago. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=24.2s)]
*  He is fully American. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=25.84s)]
*  He obviously speaks English in an Americanized way, which would be very strange hearing the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=28.36s)]
*  pope speak in Americanized English, but he obviously, that's his first language, although [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=32.12s)]
*  he speaks several others as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=37.16s)]
*  Here from the Wall Street Journal, American has elected pope for the first time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=38.84s)]
*  Quote, American Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost has become the 267th pontiff of the global [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=43.36s)]
*  Catholic Church, taking the name of Pope Leo XIV, the new pontiff, the first from the U.S. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=49.68s)]
*  in Christianity's 2,000-year history, appeared on the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=56.04s)]
*  on Thursday afternoon to a huge cheer from tens of thousands of Catholic faithful and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=61.36s)]
*  curious tourists gathered in St. Peter's Square. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=66.4s)]
*  Pope Leo was expected to be a unifying figure after years of fractious ideological tensions [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=69.52s)]
*  between the progressive and conservative wings of the Catholic Church, as a cardinal, Pope [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=74.36s)]
*  Leo rarely took an outspoken stance on the Church's polarizing issues, such as priestly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=78.56s)]
*  celibacy or blessings for same-sex couples. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=84.52s)]
*  Leo signaled continuity with the inclusive spirit of Francis' pontificate, stressing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=87.36s)]
*  the importance of synodality or gatherings of bishops and dialogue with laypeople to discuss [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=94.32s)]
*  the major challenge facing the Church. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=100.08s)]
*  That practice promoted under Francis caused much anxiety among conservative Catholics. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=102.32s)]
*  Quote, we must try together to be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges and dialogue, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=107.72s)]
*  as Pope Leo said. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=113.68s)]
*  He then led the faithful in the Hail Mary prayer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  Now, as I said at the start, he was a close ally of Pope Francis, who was regarded as [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=117.56s)]
*  a reformer or on the more progressive wing of the Catholic Church, although the progressive [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=124.68s)]
*  wing of the Catholic Church is still quite conservative, a very conservative institution [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=130.16s)]
*  by its very nature, by its age, by its function, by its purpose, by its dogma. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=134.12s)]
*  One of the things that Francis did was he was very, very outspoken about the growing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=140.08s)]
*  income inequality in the world, the need to be humane to immigrants. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=147.08s)]
*  He was also a very vocal, I suppose you could say, critic of the destruction of Gaza, but [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=152.6s)]
*  certainly a defender of the rights and suffering of the Palestinian people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=157.56s)]
*  And whether Pope Leo XIV follows some of that or all of that remains to be seen, he's been [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  a little bit of a cryptic figure, not really seeking out those kind of controversies. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=168.48s)]
*  And so it's a little bit unclear, I think even to church insiders, where he stands on [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=173.48s)]
*  them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=176.88s)]
*  Here is a scene at St. Peter's Basilica early this morning. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=177.88s)]
*  You see the new church standing on the balcony with people cheering once he, this is his [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=181.32s)]
*  first public appearance as the new pope. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=187.88s)]
*  Alright, so the innovation went on quite a long time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=198.44s)]
*  The faithful of the Catholic Church are always going to welcome a new pope with that sort [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  of extremely happy and welcoming and loving and positive emotion, and that's what you [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=231.06s)]
*  saw today. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=235.84s)]
*  Now, it is always interesting about the pope, because as I said, I'm not a theologian, I'm [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=236.84s)]
*  by no means a historian of the Catholic Church, but the pope always does have this religious [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  role, obviously. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  He's the head of the Catholic Church, this 2,000 year old institution, but he also then [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  typically has a political profile. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=253.62s)]
*  I mean, he's the head of the Vatican, which in theory is an independent state inside of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  Italy, and popes have always played a significant political role. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=258.22s)]
*  I talked about some of Pope Francis' views. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=262.74s)]
*  I remember growing up in the 1980s when Pope John Paul II was aligned very much with Ronald [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=265.7s)]
*  Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=272.18s)]
*  There's times when the pope follows the church's longstanding opposition to and contempt for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=274.5s)]
*  communism, given that communism by its dogma seeks to eradicate religion. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  It's the opiate of the people, as communists see it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  So there was always a strong political alignment among some popes with conservative politicians, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=288.74s)]
*  and then recently there has been a greater alignment. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=293.94s)]
*  I don't want to say with left-wing politicians, because certainly on social issues, the church [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  still has very, positions can widely be considered conservative on things like abortion, which [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=301.06s)]
*  they vehemently oppose, as well as same-sex marriage, which though they've softened a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=308.14s)]
*  little bit the rhetoric about, obviously they still oppose that as well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=313.9s)]
*  They also though have been traditionally associated with certain, I guess you could say left-wing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=319.54s)]
*  positions, because after all, if you read the gospel, the gospel is not a teaching of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=324.86s)]
*  support for elites or for venerating the wealthy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=332.54s)]
*  Jesus spent his time, according to all four books of the gospel, with ministering to prostitutes [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=338.82s)]
*  and to lepers and to the most downtrodden. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  And so that has always been part of the church's mission, to minister to the poor, to care [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=349.18s)]
*  for the poor, and then also the same position that makes them so opposed to abortion, namely [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=353.14s)]
*  the sanctity of human life and the sin of extinguishing it has also led them to be vehemently [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  opposed to the death penalty. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=365.73999999999995s)]
*  And that was certainly Pope Francis' position, and I believe it's Pope Leo XIV's as well. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=368.14s)]
*  Here is Donald Trump's reaction, because again, I understand why people want to put him immediately [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  through a political prism of saying, oh, is he like Maga, is he like Republican, is he [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=377.94s)]
*  Democrat, is he liberal, even though the church really does transcend those kinds of characterizations [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=383.09999999999997s)]
*  especially just trying to reduce someone who's been in the church their whole life to a few [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=389.7s)]
*  tweets you found and then want to place them on the political spectrum. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=393.62s)]
*  It almost is like a non-secretary, but that's what a lot of people were doing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump did not do that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=400.06s)]
*  He posted this, quote, congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=401.22s)]
*  named Pope. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=405.54s)]
*  It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=406.54s)]
*  What excitement and what a great honor for our country. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=410.1s)]
*  I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=412.26s)]
*  It will be a very meaningful moment. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=414.18s)]
*  I saw somebody satirizing Trump by saying tomorrow he's going to say, hey, there are [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=416.90000000000003s)]
*  a lot of people who are saying the reason an American Pope got chosen for the first [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=421.22s)]
*  time is because of me. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=425.1s)]
*  I don't know if it's true, but it probably is. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=426.1s)]
*  That's a very Trumpian way to say it, but obviously that was satire that what I just [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  read to you is what he said very, I would say, proper and well-crafted congratulations [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=431.7s)]
*  that was appropriate for a president. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=439.74s)]
*  His Vice President, J.D. Vance, interestingly, is about to show you is somebody who this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=441.5s)]
*  new pope has criticized on social media at least twice in the last six months. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=446.18s)]
*  Here is what J.D. Vance said, also an appropriate statement, no acknowledgement of the fact [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=453.82s)]
*  that the pope has criticized J.D. Vance personally and things he believes in and things he has [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=457.94s)]
*  said. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=463.1s)]
*  J.D. Vance is Catholic, and so obviously he is expressing the sentiments of what I would [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=464.1s)]
*  assume is the sentiments of most Catholics around the world, where he said, quote, congratulations [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=469.82s)]
*  14th, the first American pope on his election. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=474.82s)]
*  I'm sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  work leading the church. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=481.38s)]
*  May God bless him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=482.5s)]
*  Now, I would say within minutes, I was online when this happened. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=484.29999999999995s)]
*  I went online actually when I heard that there was a new pope selected. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=491.5s)]
*  It's obviously a significant moment for anyone who pays attention to the world and world [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=494.58s)]
*  politics and also religion, obviously. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=500.5s)]
*  And there was this hour period between when the white smoke was emitted and signaling [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=507.3s)]
*  the selection of a new pope and before the pope was announced, who the pope was, where [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=517.42s)]
*  very conservative cardinal, for whatever reason, people started assuming that that's who was [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=524.94s)]
*  selected and in the betting markets he just skyrocketed to like 70%, 80%, everybody else [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=530.7s)]
*  who were the favorites or dark horses started dropping. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  And so people were very happy because he was a conservative choice, but then when they [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=539.7800000000001s)]
*  unveiled the pope, it wasn't him that conservative. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=542.74s)]
*  It was instead Robert Prevost. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=545.02s)]
*  And at first, people, American politicians and pundits were celebrating the fact that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=546.7800000000001s)]
*  we now have an American pope for the first time in the history of the Catholic Church [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=551.88s)]
*  and the history of the United States. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=555.68s)]
*  But immediately, people started to find tweets. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  He didn't tweet often about non-church matters. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=560.8399999999999s)]
*  He tweeted very sporadically about the pope and the pope's health and just generalized [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=565.3199999999999s)]
*  kind of conventional sentiments that cardinals express in behalf of their Catholicism. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  But he did actually have some political tweets as well that one after the next, every sort [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=578.36s)]
*  of 20 minutes emerged and a lot of MAGA people, a lot of right wing people went from celebrating [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=584.0s)]
*  this choice to immediately panicking almost, or at least denouncing the choice on the ground [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=589.02s)]
*  that this is not somebody who aligns with their political ideology. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=595.88s)]
*  So here's something he posted in February of this year, so just two months ago. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=598.94s)]
*  The tweet that he wrote says, JD Vance is wrong. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=610.0200000000001s)]
*  Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=612.58s)]
*  And then it links to an article that he didn't write, but that was the headline of the article. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=615.7s)]
*  He wasn't necessarily writing. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=620.6400000000001s)]
*  That's not his sentence. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=623.1400000000001s)]
*  That's really like the headline of the article. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=624.44s)]
*  But he's obviously endorsing it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  And what happened there was JD Vance had given an interview where I think somebody asked [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  him like about the religious mandate, the Catholic imperative, to care for immigrants [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=632.6999999999999s)]
*  and to care for people who are expelled from the country or stateless. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=637.74s)]
*  And to defend on a religious ground why he believed in a hardline stand, JD Vance said [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=643.3s)]
*  there's a Catholic doctrine that says first you take care of your family and then you [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=649.14s)]
*  take care of your community and then you take care of your city and your state and your [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=654.5s)]
*  country and then after that, only then do you care about the rest of the people in the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=658.9000000000001s)]
*  world. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=663.86s)]
*  And there is a Catholic doctrine that was affirmed more or less that way, but it's been [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=664.86s)]
*  rejected by the church. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=674.14s)]
*  It's not the prevailing view of Catholicism. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=675.5s)]
*  It doesn't really reflect Catholic action in terms of how it reacts in the world. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=678.38s)]
*  And this is what the new pope was pointing to was an article arguing why JD Vance's views [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=684.46s)]
*  of what the teachings of Catholicism are when it comes to prioritizing who you care about [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=690.54s)]
*  and who you don't is Catholic dogma. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=696.02s)]
*  The new pope said, if we could just go back to that tweet for a second, JD, when he says [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=700.1s)]
*  Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others, that you're basically your love for [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=704.94s)]
*  humanity for other human beings is just the love of Jesus, that was his view. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=709.1800000000001s)]
*  Now in 2015 when Donald Trump was running for the first time on a very anti-immigrant [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=714.5400000000001s)]
*  platform, not just a platform but the way he was speaking about immigrants, it didn't [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=727.5400000000001s)]
*  sit well apparently with the new pope either because on that date he published or again [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=733.02s)]
*  cited an article by Cardinal Dolan, the title of which is why Donald Trump's anti-immigrant [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=739.5s)]
*  rhetoric is so problematic. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=745.34s)]
*  And then Laura Loomer, the quite effective influential, I guess you could call her Trump [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=749.5s)]
*  whisperer. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=755.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean she's one of the few people who gets away with constantly bashing the administration [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=756.9399999999999s)]
*  of the White House and yet still the more she does it, the more her influence seems [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=760.42s)]
*  to grow with Trump, the more her credibility seems to grow with Trump. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=765.3s)]
*  When she complains about people, they often end up being dispatched of quite quickly or [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=768.14s)]
*  fired in the case of some people as well. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=774.0999999999999s)]
*  But she replied to that tweet today with this comment, woke Marxist pope. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=777.2199999999999s)]
*  So I guess she thinks the pope is both woke and Marxist, Laura Loomer is not a member [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=784.1999999999999s)]
*  of the Catholic Church, she's Jewish, but within like I guess two hours she was able [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=788.76s)]
*  to summarize his entire worldview based on a few tweets and she's here to say that this [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=795.0s)]
*  pope is both Marxist and woke. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=799.96s)]
*  It's kind of odd for a deeply religious figure, someone who's devoted his entire life to spreading [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=802.88s)]
*  the word of Jesus to simultaneously being Marxist, it's sort of an incompatible doctrine, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=809.16s)]
*  but who knows, maybe she's right. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=813.96s)]
*  I don't think there's a lot of evidence for that, but she seems to think so. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=816.1600000000001s)]
*  Here's Sean Davis who, very smart right wing commentator and analyst, he's also Catholic, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=820.0s)]
*  and he said quote, the new pope seems to be anti-Trump and pro-open borders. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=828.88s)]
*  Which again, if you look at just these disconnected tweets, you could put those together and make [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  a lot of leaps of reasoning and maybe assume that, but certainly he's pro-immigrant, I [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=841.24s)]
*  mean the Catholic Church has always been pro-immigrant. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  You can go back hundreds of years and you're going to find that. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  Megan Kelly who is also Catholic said after all these tweets emerged quote, is it too [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=855.76s)]
*  much to hope that some 20 year old ran the new pope's ex account and he never looked [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  at it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=866.4s)]
*  That doesn't seem likely to me, to put it mildly, and again I just don't, I'm not really [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=870.0s)]
*  sure what, why people are finding these sentiments surprising. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=874.6s)]
*  They seem to align extremely well with what the Catholic Church is often, I don't want [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=880.0s)]
*  to say always, but often represented. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=884.48s)]
*  Mike Sternovich, another right wing influencer who I also often find insightful said quote, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=887.52s)]
*  I suspect that this new pope, a shitlib, is going to have many Catholics exploring [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=893.92s)]
*  orthodoxy. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=900.16s)]
*  And there has been this sense for some time, again not a theologian, but there has been [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=902.0799999999999s)]
*  this sense that the Catholic Church since the reforms in the early 60s has basically [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=907.28s)]
*  been sacrilegious or even satanic, not true Catholics, and those sentiments have sometimes [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=911.28s)]
*  grown among the orthodox wing of the Catholic Church and I guess that's what's being channeled [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=919.16s)]
*  there. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=926.1999999999999s)]
*  Here is Jack Posbiet who, Psobiatch, I always mispronounce his name, I obviously know his [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  work very well, I don't know why, it just doesn't stick in my brain, but he is Catholic, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=934.7199999999999s)]
*  he was in the Vatican and he said this quote, the pope is not infallible on political matters. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=938.1999999999999s)]
*  And I do think that's an interesting observation because as I said the pope in the modern world [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=945.68s)]
*  at least, actually in the ancient world going back many many centuries to the time it began, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=952.16s)]
*  always had this dual function of being the interpretative body that defines the meaning [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=958.0s)]
*  of God's word through Jesus Christ, but then also obviously playing a very political role, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=968.28s)]
*  the church is very powerful, it's very wealthy, it influences a lot of people and so it's inherently [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=973.72s)]
*  a political position as well and this is what you often hear from Catholics, if the pope [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=978.4000000000001s)]
*  says something on an issue that they dislike, they're like, you know, that's political, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=982.7600000000001s)]
*  that's not canon, you don't have to assume that's the word of God. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=986.2s)]
*  Amazingly the most reasonable person, because again a lot of this was based on a handful [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  of tweets that they were trying to reduce this pope to being, oh he's not MAGA, he's [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1002.8s)]
*  anti-Trump, they found some voting records that they claimed that proved he was a Republican, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1009.4799999999999s)]
*  so maybe he's like an anti-Trump or a never-Trumper, but then obviously some of them thought he [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1015.3199999999999s)]
*  was a woke Marxist as well and here's Matt Walsh who is not just Catholic but someone [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1020.88s)]
*  who speaks a lot about the church and Catholicism and he did not react well to this attempt [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1027.8799999999999s)]
*  to reduce the pope to nothing more than someone who you can just place on the American ideological [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1034.3999999999999s)]
*  spectrum and he said this, quote, if you aren't Catholic then you don't believe that the pope [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1042.74s)]
*  was elected, if you aren't Catholic then you don't believe that this pope was elected through [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1046.6s)]
*  the guidance of the Holy Spirit, so you'll troll through his Twitter feed and analyze [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1052.26s)]
*  his selection through a modern political lens as if he were just elected to a seat in the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1057.68s)]
*  U.S. Senate rather than the chair of St. Peter. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1061.52s)]
*  If you are a believing Catholic then you do or at least should believe that his election [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1064.4s)]
*  is ordained by God, you view it through the lens of 2000 years of church history and the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1068.56s)]
*  eternal will of the Almighty God, from that perspective playing the gotcha game with old [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1073.12s)]
*  tweets is silly and bizarre, this is why any conversation about the pope on this site is [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1077.16s)]
*  destined to be disjointed, confused and ultimately useless and there were other tweets as well [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1082.84s)]
*  that we didn't include where the new pope was, he retweeted a tweet from Democratic [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1088.44s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy from 2017 when Trump just got elected where Chris Murphy was basically [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1098.0s)]
*  saying we need to do everything possible to fight against and resist this new authoritarianism [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1103.8s)]
*  where this new cruelty, so the new pope retweeted Chris Murphy the Democratic Senator, he also [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1111.32s)]
*  had retweeted very recently, I think it was one of his last tweets, a different cardinal [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1116.28s)]
*  who was reacting to the meeting between El Salvador and President Bukele and President [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  Trump in the Oval Office where they kind of mocked the whole notion of court stopping [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1129.8s)]
*  immigrants from being sent to El Salvador and a cardinal reacted with horror and indignation [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1136.24s)]
*  that they seemed to be so cavalier about the fate of these people who hadn't even been [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  given due process that they were just putting them into dungeons for life in a country they'd [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1146.92s)]
*  never been to and the new pope retweeted that indignation from a cardinal in response to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1151.3200000000002s)]
*  that policy of sending people to El Salvador. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1158.0s)]
*  So again, I am not surprised personally that the pope is conservative on social issues, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1160.72s)]
*  anti-abortion, opposed to same sex marriage, opposed to the death penalty which is not [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1170.1599999999999s)]
*  a conservative view, I'm not surprised that he teaches compassion and empathy for immigrants [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1174.36s)]
*  including people who are not legally entering countries or illegally entering countries, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1182.48s)]
*  this seems very consistent, very compatible to the Catholic Church to me as somebody who [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1188.96s)]
*  has not paid the closest of attention in a scholarly way but certainly as someone who [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1194.52s)]
*  understands Catholicism to the extent I do, so I don't really understand all this acrimony, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1199.56s)]
*  all this kind of panic, this antagonism and also when you're a cardinal or when you're [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1206.96s)]
*  within the Catholic Church, he rose pretty quickly as a result of his relationship with [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1213.64s)]
*  Francis, there's not always total freedom to express your world view or who you are [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1216.8400000000001s)]
*  and what you believe and what your priorities are and so we'll see with this new pope what [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1224.6000000000001s)]
*  he decides to make of his position and I think only then will we really know his ideology [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1229.16s)]
*  or place on the ideological spectrum if a pope can even be placed on that, I think as [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1236.6000000000001s)]
*  Matt Wallace actually said and I basically agree with it, in a way the idea of the pope [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1242.28s)]
*  and the Catholic Church transcends modern political debates even though they sometimes [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eljLJech0qU&t=1247.48s)]
