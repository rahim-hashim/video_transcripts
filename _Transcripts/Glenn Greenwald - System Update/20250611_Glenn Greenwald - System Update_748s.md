# Dave Portnoy's Revealing MELTDOWN
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc)
*  As many of you know, Dave Portnoy has become quite well known. He's the founder of Barstool, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=0.0s)]
*  which grew into a very successful sports company, a very successful site that covers sports, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=12.5s)]
*  and it has really become a major business. There are now Barstool bars all over the place. I was [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=21.72s)]
*  in Scottsdale, Arizona just a week ago or two weeks ago. There's a big Barstool bar right at the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=29.74s)]
*  heart of downtown Scottsdale. All over the place, he's become extremely wealthy as a result, but [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  he's also ventured out more into politics, and he's one of those kind of guys that you could [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=40.62s)]
*  kind of describe as being adjacent to what has become the Manosphere. Very kind of, you know, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  just men being men is the idea without any embarrassment. Talking about women, sports, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=52.94s)]
*  those sorts of things, and the political ethos that has come out of this is very much one that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  says cancel culture is wrong. People shouldn't be punished for offensive things they say, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=65.34s)]
*  especially for jokes. They're particularly offended. The whole kind of whole Rogan sphere [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=71.74s)]
*  is when a comedian tells a joke about a certain group and people get offended. It's like, why [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=76.94s)]
*  would you get offended by a joke? We can't keep having this repressive atmosphere. Dave Portnoy [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=83.78s)]
*  has been one of the leaders of that. He endures Trump as a result of a lot of these issues, and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=89.3s)]
*  he has been known for and associated with that kind of ethos. Like, anything goes, anything can [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=95.06s)]
*  be said. If you're offended, who cares? Just be offended. And that's what was so remarkable to see [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=101.1s)]
*  this weekend that Dave Portnoy went on one of the podcasts, the various podcasts that Barstool [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=111.58s)]
*  represent, that Barstool hosts, and he was on there with an employee of his. I believe his name [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=116.94s)]
*  is Kirk Minahan. And they got into an extremely heated argument because Dave Portnoy was arguing [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=122.06s)]
*  that it is inappropriate at this moment when Jews face such intense and incomparable dangers to tell [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=133.7s)]
*  jokes at the expense of American Jews, to tell jokes about Jews. You can joke about other groups, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=142.26s)]
*  he was arguing, just not jokes about Jews. The group to which Dave Portnoy coincidentally happens [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=147.54s)]
*  to belong. That's the one group that is too endangered, too vulnerable, to the point where [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=155.78s)]
*  not even jokes about them should be permitted. I'm not saying he was arguing for a law that would [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=160.82s)]
*  imprison people for telling Jewish jokes, just that at this point it should be considered utterly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=167.14s)]
*  unacceptable socially to even tell a joke about Jewish people. And here was part of that exchange. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=172.86s)]
*  I think right now you probably don't do it. Okay, nothing, nothing. Silence everything. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  Every comedian, don't tell a joke about it. Like, Dave, that's how the world works. I agree with you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=186.3s)]
*  Go back to your question. When does freedom of speech impinge on freedom of religion? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=191.74s)]
*  That was your question, not mine. Answer it. How many deaths? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I don't have an answer. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=198.86s)]
*  In America, American citizens. What's your answer to that question? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=202.78s)]
*  Now, now, now. So now what? So now what do we do? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  Maybe you stop with the f***ing Jew jokes and act like it's not a big deal when someone does f*** the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=210.22s)]
*  Jews in a bar. Here's the thing, I'm with you a thousand percent of it. You should f***ing kick [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=215.17999999999998s)]
*  those people out. Of course you should. I'm not talking about kicking them out. I'm talking about- [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=221.26s)]
*  You want to go to jail? What do you want? You are defending this guy Mick for what he said [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=224.54s)]
*  right after that happened. He's not anti-Semitic. Yes he is. If your brain goes in- [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=230.86s)]
*  I'm not defending him, Dave. What I'm saying is you should have him on here or somebody else like [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=235.5s)]
*  that and f***ing fight with them because then you have a conversation. That's what this idiot wants. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=239.34s)]
*  Dave, these guys that wrote the thing at the bar f*** the Jews, right? Yes. You're gonna f***ing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  fly them to Auschwitz. Some guy tweets at you something you want to f***. He's not- [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  Kirk, it was a bar I owned. It was a bar I owned. I agree. They should have been kicked out. So, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=252.62s)]
*  my thing is- No, it's not just kick out, Kirk. Are you ignoring what's going on in the world right now? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=257.18s)]
*  No, I'm not. Dave, what would you want to do with those guys? What do you want to do with those guys [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  at the bar? We're in jail for 50 years? Fine. I don't care. I didn't say that. You're quite [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=265.82s)]
*  literally changing everything you say. Kirk, if you just want me to kick them out and not mention it, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=271.18s)]
*  not care that this kid anti-Semitic- Not at all. Shut up. If you just want me to ignore it- [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=275.74s)]
*  Don't tell me to shut up. Shut the f*** up, you bald f***. Okay, go ahead. How's that? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  I'll never recover from that, Dave. Go ahead, continue. I'll never recover. Well, you're the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=287.34s)]
*  one who like, oh, big boss man, don't tell- I'll tell you, you work for me. Okay, go ahead, continue. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=291.02s)]
*  You little f***, you work for me. Sure, you bet. For now. Oh, you don't? For now? Quit. I don't care. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=295.02s)]
*  Is this show or not a show? Is this show or not a show? We can't have a conversation? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=301.26s)]
*  You're an idiot. Okay, continue. You're literally saying people should be allowed to make Jew jokes, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  say whatever they want right f***ing now. Yes, I think people should be allowed to make jokes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  How many f***ing Jews have to be killed before you stop? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=314.38s)]
*  What else? Where else is that happening with the religion or people? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=321.02s)]
*  All right, so obviously that was quite an erudite conversation. A lot of philosophical inquiry [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=326.54s)]
*  embedded within it, but I think nonetheless, the point, even if you're not inclined to that kind of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=332.78s)]
*  complexity, is quite clear that the important thing was saying, look, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=338.7s)]
*  Jews are so endangered, so many Jews are being killed. I don't know exactly where that's happening. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=343.58s)]
*  There was an incident where two staffers of the Israeli embassy were randomly murdered [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=349.9s)]
*  a couple weeks ago in Washington, D.C. I don't think that makes an epidemic of Jews being killed, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=358.06s)]
*  but David Portnoy is essentially saying, look, this is not the time to be telling jokes about Jews. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=364.3s)]
*  Maybe there's other times when it's okay to do that, but given all the things that are happening [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=370.14s)]
*  in the world, how many Jews have to die before we finally agree that jokes about Jewish people, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=375.42s)]
*  jokes about Jewish people, are off limits? And again, this is the person who has basically [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  made a name for himself, championing the cause of everything goes. Say whatever you want, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  as offensive as it is, especially if it's a joke. Nobody should ever say you can't say it, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=397.74s)]
*  that it's offensive, and in fact, in the very same discussion where he more or less proclaimed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=403.26000000000005s)]
*  that there ought to be a moratorium on telling Jew jokes, the very same day, Portnoy advocated for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=410.3s)]
*  and called for violence. He incited and called for the IDF to go and murder Greta Thunberg for [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=417.1s)]
*  the crime of trying to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza as an expression of opposition to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=424.06s)]
*  what Israel is doing in Gaza. Here's what he said. This model of probity and responsible discourse, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=429.66s)]
*  here is what he said in that same interview after declaring a moratorium on jokes about [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=435.98s)]
*  Jews because it's too dangerous. You should just go over to Gaza. We can do unnamed. You can be live. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  I'll jump on Greta Van Forsten or whatever that girl, she's sailing there, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  like whoever that fuck. I hope they hit a fucking missile on her boat. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=451.18s)]
*  So I don't know, it seems a little selective to me, but one of the things that, of course, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=459.34s)]
*  I've been noticing for a long time is that so many people who were self-proclaimed free speech [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  champions have suddenly found all sorts of reasons to support censorship when it comes to this one [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  country and it comes to this one group. That's been a very common theme on our show. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=473.82s)]
*  People who are rallying against the snowflakes, who want to cancel people for saying offensive [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  things, suddenly want all kinds of people fired, who make comments that offend them about Israel. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  And so it was something I just couldn't help noting because in this case it was such a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=490.3s)]
*  glaring example of somebody who has been so proud, so aggressive, so vocal about how only losers [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=494.53999999999996s)]
*  and snowflakes get upset with jokes and at the same time now suddenly declaring a moratorium [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=503.66s)]
*  on jokes when it comes to the group to which he belongs. And this is what I said in response [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=509.26000000000005s)]
*  to this video, quote, so many people transformed in record speed from, quote, only woke losers [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=514.62s)]
*  and snowflakes want to ban offensive speech to, quote, we must urgently ban jokes against one [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=521.98s)]
*  particular minority group, which coincidentally happens to be my own because these jokes are too [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=527.74s)]
*  dangerous to allow and that is the thing I've seen over and over. In response is what he said, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=533.26s)]
*  hey Glenn baby you clearly didn't watch the entire video and are just using my name for clicks. I [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=539.42s)]
*  didn't even use his name. I don't know why I would need clicks. So let me clarify, recently found out [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=544.54s)]
*  you were that into that gay kink shit that got leaked. No judgment, we all have kinks, but I'll [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=549.66s)]
*  put it in terms you can understand after the Pulse nightclub attack when Omar Mateen killed a ton of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=554.46s)]
*  gays because it violates his religion. If somebody tagged you seconds after that tragedy with a [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=559.82s)]
*  homophobic joke, you'd presumably hate that person and assume they were a homophobic dickhead and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=565.4200000000001s)]
*  rightfully so. It doesn't make it illegal, just makes them an asshole. Now if a person says being [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=570.94s)]
*  gay is against the will of God and says you should murder all gays, including you in cold blood, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=576.62s)]
*  that to me is a problem and is no longer just free speech. So what I was saying, and you'd know if [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=581.34s)]
*  you watched the entire video, people want to tag me and make Jew jokes right after a terrorist [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=586.14s)]
*  attack in the U.S. they can do that and they are doing it, but those people are anti-semitic pieces [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=590.14s)]
*  of shit. The oh Dave can't take a joke angle doesn't work for me in that case because I'm sure if [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=595.02s)]
*  somebody made fun of a bunch of gays getting slaughtered you wouldn't think it was funny, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=600.78s)]
*  I didn't say they should go to jail, just that they are pieces of shit. And then it just kind of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=604.62s)]
*  goes on in that vein. Now the Pulse shooting did end up killing a lot of gay people. It wasn't a [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=608.9399999999999s)]
*  gay nightclub in Orlando, but as anybody who is familiar with that episode knows, the intention [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=616.14s)]
*  on the part of the person who did the killing had nothing to do with targeting gay people. He didn't [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=624.38s)]
*  even know Pulse was a gay nightclub. He was looking for a nightclub that was a soft target, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=629.98s)]
*  that didn't have security because of its popularity. That was the first one that came up in a Google [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=634.54s)]
*  search when he searched nightclubs Orlando. Never made a single homophobic remark while there, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  never suggested that was part of his motive. The trial proved that it wasn't. He was there to avenge [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=645.5s)]
*  what he said was US aggression in Iraq and Syria and killing innocent civilians in places like [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=649.74s)]
*  Afghanistan. A kind of common terrorist attack and motive for it. But I don't recall anybody [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=655.5s)]
*  after the Pulse nightclub attack saying that jokes about gay people are now prohibited or banned [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=663.34s)]

*  insensitive about claims of prejudice or claims of victimhood from every other group that he has [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=696.06s)]
*  nothing to do with and a hypersensitive about supposed threats to or jokes about the group [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=705.9799999999999s)]
*  with which he identifies. It's just become a very common dynamic that we've seen over and over from [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLyayiFjPPc&t=713.18s)]
