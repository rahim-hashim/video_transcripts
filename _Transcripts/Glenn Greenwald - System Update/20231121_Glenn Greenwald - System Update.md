# New Jan 6 Tapes: They Lied to Us, w/ Darren Beattie | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE)
*  Let's dive into this new release of January 6 tapes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=0.0s)]
*  This was something that a lot of the people who [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=13.06s)]
*  were opposed to Speaker McCarthy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=15.8s)]
*  were enraged by the fact that he did Kevin McCarthy, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=17.12s)]
*  under a lot of pressure, release these tapes, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Fox to go through and report on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=22.6s)]
*  But he never made them all public. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  It was one of the promises they extracted from Mike Johnson [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=29.32s)]
*  when they decided to make him speaker. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=33.08s)]
*  He made good on that promise very quickly, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=36.0s)]
*  just in the last 48, 72 hours. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=38.8s)]
*  He released a whole bunch of new January 6 tapes [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=42.0s)]
*  that nobody had ever seen before, the first time [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  the public gets to see them all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  I just want to give viewers who haven't seen it [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=50.72s)]
*  a kind of taste of just one of the videos that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=53.84s)]
*  coming into the Capitol, not violently, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  not having to fight their way through, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=59.88s)]
*  not being stopped by the police, but actually welcomed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=61.56s)]
*  by the police and marched through the Capitol [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  quite peacefully. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=66.64s)]
*  Let's take a look at this video. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  So you don't really obviously hear any audio, of course, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=87.2s)]
*  but for people listening by podcast, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=90.12s)]
*  you have these police officers standing on the side. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=92.44s)]
*  You have Trump supporters who are marching into the Capitol. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  They're not in any way engaging in any violence. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=97.64s)]
*  They're not being stopped. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  In fact, the police seem to be shepherding them in, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=101.36s)]
*  escorting them in, walking them in. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  They're being very peaceful. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=106.4s)]
*  They're walking slowly, walking without having [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  to fight anybody. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=110.0s)]
*  Some of them are just taking videos. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=111.68s)]
*  It's very kind of tranquil scene. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  So Darren, let me ask you about this video [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  and the new videos we've seen. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=119.0s)]
*  Obviously, we did learn a lot when Tucker Carlson finally [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  got his hands on them and was able to show us these videos. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=123.36s)]
*  But before we get into the content of them, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=126.48s)]
*  just talk about the process. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=128.4s)]
*  Like when the January 6 committee existed, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=129.6s)]
*  we saw only the tapes and excerpts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=133.28s)]
*  that Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and Adam Schiff [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=136.44s)]
*  and Benny Thompson wanted us to see, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=141.16s)]
*  and they hid everything else. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=143.44s)]
*  What does it say that it took this long, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=144.96s)]
*  two and a half years almost, almost three full years, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  to be able to have the public see all the videos, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=151.08s)]
*  not just the videos they wanted us to see? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=153.68s)]
*  Well, there's been a severe reluctance [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=158.4s)]
*  on the part of the mainstream media and the regime [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=161.96s)]
*  to allow the public to see any direct footage of January 6 [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  that could complicate or contradict [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=170.12s)]
*  the official narrative that's been shoved down our throats [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=173.6s)]
*  every day for years now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=177.16s)]
*  And that narrative is that January 6 [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=179.76s)]
*  is some sort of horrific, unique event of domestic terror [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=182.4s)]
*  that exceeds even 9-11. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=187.88s)]
*  And I think Biden even said at one point, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  exceeds the civil war in terms of the trauma [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=193.32s)]
*  that inflicted on the country. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=196.88s)]
*  They've invested a tremendous amount of money [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=199.6s)]
*  and resources and attention in crystallizing that narrative [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=202.76s)]
*  because it's used as a pretext to further the weaponization [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  of the national security state against the American people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=213.28s)]
*  So there's a lot riding on it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  and anything that challenges that narrative, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=218.6s)]
*  certainly I experienced it directly [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=220.72s)]
*  because Revolver News was at the forefront [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=222.88s)]
*  of challenging various aspects of that official narrative. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=225.76s)]
*  And so this footage is in that vein. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=229.44s)]
*  I think anyone who's paid close attention to the issue [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=234.08s)]
*  already knew that the Capitol Police [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  provoked the crowd gratuitously with flash bangs and so forth. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=243.16s)]
*  Anyone paying attention would have already known [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  that the Capitol Police in many instances [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=251.84s)]
*  opened the doors to the crowd and so forth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  But developments such as this, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=256.68s)]
*  where the footage becomes more widely available [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=259.88s)]
*  and at scale, like the full range of footage, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=263.68s)]
*  it's very important because it reinforces the understanding [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=266.68s)]
*  that's already been out there by some of the researchers [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=271.92s)]
*  like we've been doing, Julie Kelly and others. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=275.64s)]
*  And it allows the public to really understand [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=279.44s)]
*  what really happened and the public [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=284.92s)]
*  that hasn't really paid much attention to it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=287.48s)]
*  And so I think it's very significant [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=290.04s)]
*  that this came out for a variety of reasons. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=292.52s)]
*  And my understanding is there's gonna be still more footage. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=294.68s)]
*  So a lot of people who may not have paid attention to it, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=297.6s)]
*  they see this video and they say, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=300.6s)]
*  this is not what they've been telling me [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=302.64s)]
*  every day for years now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=304.88s)]
*  You know, the amazing thing too is the role of the media. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=307.4s)]
*  Obviously the media paid enormous amounts of attention [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=310.32s)]
*  to January 6th, you could argue it's one of the two [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=313.04s)]
*  or three top stories to which they paid attention [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=315.16s)]
*  for obvious reasons since it happened. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=318.12s)]
*  Usually when there's material that the government has [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=321.44s)]
*  relevant to a story the media is covering, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  one of the duties of media is to insist on transparency, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  to press for it, to ask for it, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=331.56s)]
*  to complain that the government's not releasing it, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  and then ultimately to sue under Freedom of Information Act [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=335.8s)]
*  or other kinds of provisions that force the government [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  to release it, that's one of the jobs [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=341.28s)]
*  of journalists by definition. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  And we were talking about this last week [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=345.88s)]
*  in the context of the shooting, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=347.28s)]
*  the mass shooting at that Christian school [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=350.67999999999995s)]
*  by that trans woman who wrote a manifesto, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=352.96s)]
*  killed six people, three of whom were nine year old students, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=357.08s)]
*  the others were 60 year old teachers, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  who left a manifesto, usually the media feasts [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=362.11999999999995s)]
*  on these manifestos, wants to get their hands on them [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=364.32s)]
*  so they can figure out what conservative pundits [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=366.4s)]
*  or politicians to blame for having caused the violence, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=369.12s)]
*  to claim that the people, that they were radicalized [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=373.16s)]
*  by this person or that person. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=375.68s)]
*  And in this case, we haven't gotten the manifesto [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=377.88s)]
*  for seven or eight months, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=380.72s)]
*  the Nashville Police Department, the FBI, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=382.44s)]
*  have had all sorts of obviously pretextual reasons [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=384.88s)]
*  why they can't release it, including claiming [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=389.24s)]
*  there's an ongoing investigation still to determine [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=390.96s)]
*  if there was a co-conspirator, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=394.04s)]
*  when everybody knows this person acted alone, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=395.92s)]
*  there's nothing to investigate, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  they just don't want this leaking, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=400.04s)]
*  and then we finally got a few pages through Steven Crowder [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=402.12s)]
*  and they immediately big-tacked it, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=405.16s)]
*  banned it from even being discussed. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=406.92s)]
*  And in this case, you had almost nobody in the media [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=409.2s)]
*  doing things like retaining counsel, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=412.68s)]
*  we retained counsel in Nashville, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=414.52s)]
*  by that point there were other lawsuits already pending [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=416.44s)]
*  and they just told us you can repeat it, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=419.36s)]
*  but these lawsuits are gonna make their way [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=421.0s)]
*  through the courts and now they are. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  But the same thing happened here with January 6th, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=424.6s)]
*  a much bigger story, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=427.2s)]
*  I don't think there were any media outlets [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=429.12s)]
*  trying to pressure the government to release the footage, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=431.56s)]
*  why do you think that is? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=435.44s)]
*  Well, it depends what kind of pressure you mean, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=439.64s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people who have been saying [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  the full range of footage should be released to the public [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=445.84s)]
*  and not undergo any kind of process of mediation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=451.2s)]
*  Right, I'm sorry, I meant like media corporations, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=455.32s)]
*  like large media corporations, like the New York Times, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=458.0s)]
*  NBC, CNN have not been suing, have not been demanding, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  that's all I meant, yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=463.44s)]
*  Right, well, I mean, their vested interest [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=465.92s)]
*  is basically on the narrative [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=468.0s)]
*  that they'd already been promoting. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=469.56s)]
*  And I suspect that they did have access to it [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=471.48s)]
*  and based on that access, they selectively presented [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=475.88s)]
*  the footage that best solidified their narrative. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  And what's ironic about that is, for instance, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=484.76s)]
*  there was a very carefully curated video montage [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=487.84s)]
*  or short documentary thing, the New York Times did [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=495.15999999999997s)]
*  called January 6th Day of Rage, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  in which in their full range of footage, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  they selected the clips that most darkly [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=503.08s)]
*  and ominously suggested a pre-planned attack on the Capitol. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=507.84s)]
*  And guess who appears not once, but twice [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=513.32s)]
*  in this short montage is none other than Ray Epps. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=517.52s)]
*  So before the New York Times was releasing, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=521.6s)]
*  publishing fully dedicated puff pieces to Epps, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=524.84s)]
*  they thought that his participation was so egregious [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=528.2s)]
*  that in the mountains of footage they had access to, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=532.32s)]
*  it warranted two appearances in their montage [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=535.2800000000001s)]
*  designed to portray the narrative [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=539.64s)]
*  that this was a pre-planned event of domestic terrorism. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of interesting twists and turns [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=546.0400000000001s)]
*  when you look into it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=549.4s)]
*  For sure, and I wanna ask you about Ray Epps in a second. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=550.52s)]
*  That was something I was planning on asking you about [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=552.52s)]
*  and I wanna get to that in a minute. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=553.84s)]
*  But before I get to that, there was violence on that day. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=554.84s)]
*  There were caches between protesters and police [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=560.84s)]
*  as we've seen in so many protests of various kinds [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  over the last, say, couple decades in the United States. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=569.16s)]
*  And well before that, I mean, in the 60s, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=572.16s)]
*  there used to be these kinds of protests all the time [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=573.88s)]
*  where protesters and police would fight against each other. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  So there was violence, there was some clashes [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=579.04s)]
*  between protesters and police. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=582.28s)]
*  Some police ended up injured. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=583.7199999999999s)]
*  But what are these clips that we hadn't yet seen [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=585.7199999999999s)]
*  until just now, things like them entering the Capitol [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=590.3s)]
*  without any attempt to stop them, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=594.24s)]
*  what did they show us that that narrative [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  that we've been fed excluded? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, and again, like we've already seen [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=603.56s)]
*  this type of footage, but it simply reinforces the fact [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=606.0s)]
*  that in the overwhelming majority of cases, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=610.24s)]
*  it was people who had been let in [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=614.3599999999999s)]
*  or went in largely unopposed, who weren't destructive, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=617.12s)]
*  did not destroy any property, did not assault any officers [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=622.8s)]
*  and just kind of went with the flow [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=626.82s)]
*  of what must have been a very surreal experience [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=631.4200000000001s)]
*  of kind of people just rolling through the Capitol [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=634.38s)]
*  and sort of taking pictures and marveling [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=638.0600000000001s)]
*  at how bizarre the whole experience was. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=640.46s)]
*  And then they're out of the Capitol [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=643.38s)]
*  five minutes later in many instances. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=645.4200000000001s)]
*  Then the next thing they know, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=648.0200000000001s)]
*  they're treated like Osama bin Laden. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the story of a lot of people [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=652.74s)]
*  who just kind of got caught up in the crowd psychology, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=655.9s)]
*  but when if the crowd is going in, the cops aren't opposing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=659.14s)]
*  In many cases, they're opening the door [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=663.06s)]
*  and fist bumping people and chatting with people [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=664.98s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=668.3s)]
*  You don't really register that you're putting yourself [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=669.64s)]
*  in a position of a future domestic terrorist. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=672.22s)]
*  And then you mosey on through for five minutes, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  take a few pictures, text your relatives on, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=680.02s)]
*  this is crazy, I'm in the Capitol, and then you leave. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=682.94s)]
*  And then the next thing you know, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=686.1s)]
*  your entire life is ruined and turned upside down. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=687.1400000000001s)]
*  So I think the video footage kind of reinforces [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=689.58s)]
*  that reality and helps us to understand [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=693.6600000000001s)]
*  how that could be the case. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=696.6400000000001s)]
*  And as for the other aspect of the footage [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=698.3000000000001s)]
*  on the outside of the Capitol, it shows, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=700.62s)]
*  again, these gratuitous actions of provocation [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=703.4200000000001s)]
*  from the Capitol police, the flash bangs [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=706.94s)]
*  and things like this that really provoked the crowd. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=711.56s)]
*  And I think a lot of the violent behavior [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  we saw in the part of the crowd was actually agitated [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  and precipitated by these actions of the Capitol police [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=721.0799999999999s)]
*  that may or may not have been given the green light [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=725.66s)]
*  from above. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=729.0s)]
*  Yeah, to this day, it amazes me that of all the people [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=730.0s)]
*  charged and prosecuted in the January 6th cases, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=735.6199999999999s)]
*  a small percentage of them were accused of using violence. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=739.2s)]
*  The vast majority of them, the state acknowledges, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=741.84s)]
*  the government acknowledges did not in fact use violence. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=745.1s)]
*  And yet we watch people convicted [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=747.88s)]
*  of nonviolent protest crimes, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=750.1400000000001s)]
*  like the Q Shaman, for example, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=752.08s)]
*  who went to prison for a long time, for years, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=753.7800000000001s)]
*  people got prison sentences of years or many months, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  pre-trial detention, even though they were never accused [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=761.36s)]
*  of any violence. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=765.3000000000001s)]
*  And it's unbelievable to me to watch left liberals [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=766.1400000000001s)]
*  cheer and applaud and support not just the prosecution, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=769.96s)]
*  but the imprisonment of nonviolent protesters, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=773.2800000000001s)]
*  political protesters, given the precedence [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=776.44s)]
*  that this would create, this has created, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=779.48s)]
*  and the sorts of things they've always said. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=781.96s)]
*  All right, let's talk about your friend Ray Epps. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=784.24s)]
*  We've talked many times about him on this show. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=785.74s)]
*  You've been elsewhere talking about him. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=787.7800000000001s)]
*  Other conservative journalists and pundits [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=789.76s)]
*  have spoken about him, raising questions, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=793.36s)]
*  like he seems to have played a very central role [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=795.2s)]
*  in a lot of these events. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=799.52s)]
*  You see him on video, as you said, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=800.36s)]
*  the New York Times featured him twice, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=801.2s)]
*  thinking he was a pretty important person. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=803.44s)]
*  He was on tape, really provoking people [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=805.52s)]
*  to storm the Capitol, to use violence, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=808.36s)]
*  revving them up, and yet all these people [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  that we just talked about went to prison. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=813.58s)]
*  Ray Epps never did, and it raised the question [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=815.98s)]
*  of why that was. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=818.12s)]
*  He insisted he had never worked for the FBI, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=819.52s)]
*  threatened to sue people. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  I think he now has sued a couple of people, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=822.52s)]
*  including Tucker Carlson, who insinuated [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=825.26s)]
*  that he might have worked for the government. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=827.0799999999999s)]
*  He now has been charged. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=829.24s)]
*  He pled guilty to a misdemeanor account, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=831.52s)]
*  one misdemeanor count. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=834.76s)]
*  I don't believe he got a prison term, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=837.3s)]
*  or if he did, it was very short. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=838.8399999999999s)]
*  Does the fact that he's now finally been charged [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=841.5999999999999s)]
*  and pled guilty change your mind [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=844.1999999999999s)]
*  about some of the questions surrounding him? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=845.88s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it seems like a very desperate attempt [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=851.4s)]
*  to patch things up, but it's too little too late. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=854.64s)]
*  You can't wait over two years after [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=859.12s)]
*  when all is said and done, and then slap him [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=861.92s)]
*  with a misdemeanor charge that doesn't even match [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=864.36s)]
*  the same charging of other people who've gotten [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=869.48s)]
*  misdemeanors, let alone obstruction [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=872.8s)]
*  of official proceeding, felony, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=875.48s)]
*  and there's so many other charges available [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=877.88s)]
*  to the Department of Justice. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=881.06s)]
*  They wanted to use them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=883.04s)]
*  They didn't have to wait this long, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=884.28s)]
*  and they could have very easily given him [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=885.6s)]
*  much more severe charges. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=887.28s)]
*  And of course, they don't have to, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=889.24s)]
*  but the manner in which they exercise [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=891.36s)]
*  prosecutorial discretion is very telling [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=893.68s)]
*  because very early on, a guy named Michael Sherwin, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=896.04s)]
*  who is in charge of these prosecutions, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  who advocated infamously a shock and awe approach [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=904.4599999999999s)]
*  to arresting as many people before Biden's inauguration, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=908.0s)]
*  he, I think, reasonably stated that, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=912.1999999999999s)]
*  look, we're going after the conspicuous cases, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=914.56s)]
*  the cases of people like the Q shaman [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=918.04s)]
*  who were kind of publicly flouting us. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=920.8s)]
*  The more visible cases were the ones [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=923.56s)]
*  that they wanted to exercise their prosecutorial discretion [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=926.04s)]
*  to make an example of. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  And Ray Epps was among the most visible, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=930.98s)]
*  if not the most visible. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=933.3199999999999s)]
*  He was one of the first 20 people [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=936.0s)]
*  put on the FBI's most wanted list. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=937.76s)]
*  As I mentioned, of all the footage [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=940.42s)]
*  the New York Times could have chosen [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=942.78s)]
*  to reinforce their ominous narrative, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=944.42s)]
*  they chose Epps, and they chose him for a reason. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=946.38s)]
*  He was a very public figure with a sort of made for TV, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=949.8199999999999s)]
*  made for virality moment saying, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=956.5s)]
*  we need to go into the Capitol, into the Capitol. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=959.62s)]
*  A guy, a former Marine, in camouflage with a Trump hat, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=962.74s)]
*  telling the crowds to go into the Capitol, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=968.58s)]
*  who, by the way, people forget this, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=971.0600000000001s)]
*  he was the former head of the Arizona chapter [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=973.82s)]
*  of the Oath Keepers, the most demonized [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=976.86s)]
*  and heavily prosecuted militia group, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=979.54s)]
*  Sociogenius X, other than arguably the Proud Boys. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=981.42s)]
*  So with all of this stuff on paper, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=985.02s)]
*  he would be exactly the kind of person [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=987.54s)]
*  they'd wanna make an example of, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=989.92s)]
*  and they had very easy indictments on him [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=991.78s)]
*  from the very beginning. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=995.1s)]
*  Not only did they wait over two years [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=996.22s)]
*  to do a sham misdemeanor, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=998.26s)]
*  which they warned him about in advance, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1000.9s)]
*  in contrast to all the other people [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1003.58s)]
*  who've gotten the SWAT treatment of the guns [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1005.46s)]
*  bursting down the doors at three in the morning. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1008.78s)]
*  They just said, oh, by the way, Epps, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1010.9s)]
*  we wanna inform you, you're gonna get a misdemeanor charge [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1012.5400000000001s)]
*  now over two years later. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1015.74s)]
*  And by the way, this charge, which fits into the theory [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1017.58s)]
*  of these ridiculous defamation suits that he has. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1022.62s)]
*  It's all so convenient for him. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1026.44s)]
*  So the short answer is no, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1029.84s)]
*  I don't think a misdemeanor charge over two years [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1031.28s)]
*  after the fact changes anything, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1034.2s)]
*  but underscores how desperate the regime is [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1036.18s)]
*  to tie up loose ends when it's too little too late. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1038.72s)]
*  Just to tie in quickly to something you were talking about [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1041.8s)]
*  earlier in your monologue, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1044.52s)]
*  guess who the lawyer, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1046.2s)]
*  Ray Epps' lawyer, his representation [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1050.8s)]
*  for these defamation cases, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1053.24s)]
*  guess who he's worked for and he works for now. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1055.38s)]
*  Is it Media Matters? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1059.74s)]
*  None other. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1061.14s)]
*  Well, not quite, but close. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1063.0800000000002s)]
*  David Brock? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1064.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1065.94s)]
*  Yep. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1067.42s)]
*  So the fact that now David Brock is in the orbit of Ray Epps [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1068.3400000000001s)]
*  as indirectly supporting Ray Epps' defamation suits, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1074.42s)]
*  which at least until now are technically [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1079.5s)]
*  just against Fox News, not against Tucker or myself [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1081.94s)]
*  though we feature prominently within the defamation suit. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1085.94s)]
*  But yeah, it's pretty remarkable that David Brock, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1089.66s)]
*  a lawyer that worked for David Brock, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1096.38s)]
*  who is of the law firm Perkins Coy, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1098.74s)]
*  which in a variety of contexts sits at the intersection [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1101.5s)]
*  of the Democrats and the national security state, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1105.76s)]
*  that this should be the individual to represent Epps. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1109.0200000000002s)]
*  And I don't know whether Epps actually has to pay for him [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1113.22s)]
*  or whether it's pro bono or something else, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1116.02s)]
*  but it's certainly an interesting day. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1118.64s)]
*  I'd be shocked if, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1121.02s)]
*  this is a major law firm in Washington and elsewhere. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1121.8600000000001s)]
*  They played a major role in the interaction [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1125.58s)]
*  with Russiagate and the Democrats and the security state [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1129.9s)]
*  with Democratic Party voting suits of all kinds. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1132.74s)]
*  It's an extremely expensive firm. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1136.02s)]
*  I seriously doubt Ray Epps has the ability to pay for it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1137.82s)]
*  The way in which Ray Epps has been turned [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1141.36s)]
*  into a political cause, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1143.24s)]
*  every single other person in 9-11, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1144.3999999999999s)]
*  January 6 rather, has been talked about as a Satanist, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1147.04s)]
*  as you said, as like almost a member of Al-Qaeda or worse. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1150.8s)]
*  And yet the media has defended Ray Epps so vigorously [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1154.54s)]
*  as have Democrats from the very beginning. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1157.36s)]
*  They went so out of their way [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1160.4399999999998s)]
*  to be able to charge everybody there with felonies. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1162.28s)]
*  We've talked about before the way they had [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1164.9599999999998s)]
*  to stretch these precedents, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1166.52s)]
*  use this Sarbanes Act in order, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1168.42s)]
*  that was really designed to punish people [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1174.9s)]
*  who had done things like impede the Enron investigation [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1178.14s)]
*  by trying to turn this into some sort of interference [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1181.24s)]
*  with an official investigation to turn it into a felony, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1184.24s)]
*  something that that law had never intended to cover before. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1186.66s)]
*  And yet they went out of their way [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1190.38s)]
*  to make sure Ray Epps got charged with a misdemeanor, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1191.44s)]
*  even though his involvement was so much greater [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1193.8200000000002s)]
*  as was reflected by the fact [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1197.54s)]
*  that the New York Times was featuring him as you said. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1PN78HiZLE&t=1199.46s)]
