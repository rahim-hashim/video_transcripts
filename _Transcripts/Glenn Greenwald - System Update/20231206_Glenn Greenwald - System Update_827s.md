# Rep. Thomas Massie Rejects Antisemitism Accusations, AIPAC Attacks
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc)
*  Thomas Massey is a Republican Congressman representing Kentucky's fourth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=0.0s)]
*  congressional district since 2012. He was originally part of the Tea Party movement [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=10.32s)]
*  and has long identified as Marvel Libertarian Republican when he ran first [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=14.84s)]
*  for Congress. He was endorsed by Ron Paul among others and there's a lot of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=18.96s)]
*  things to talk to him about. We are thrilled to have him here. Congressman [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=23.92s)]
*  Massey, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=27.16s)]
*  Oh I'm excited to be on your show, Glenn. I've been waiting for this for a while [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=30.44s)]
*  and I doubt we'll get through all the material tonight. So you start with what [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=35.56s)]
*  you want to talk about. Absolutely. We only have a limited time which we of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=40.44s)]
*  course want to respect so let's delve in and then we'll harass you to come back [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=43.64s)]
*  on and have a more a broader conversation. So let me ask start with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=47.08s)]
*  this. Israel is the country that over the last several decades has received more [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  USAID by far than any other country. It gets four billion dollars a year every [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=56.88s)]
*  time it has a new war. The Congress, the President want the US to pay for it and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=61.92s)]
*  the US does. What is your view on the overall US support for Israel in terms [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=66.48s)]
*  of money and what's your view specifically of President Biden's new [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  request for 14 billion dollars more at least to start with to fund this new [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=75.76s)]
*  war? Well let me be clear I don't single out any country with my ideology. I don't [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=79.92s)]
*  support foreign aid. My position is that we are almost 34 trillion dollars in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=86.8s)]
*  debt. We can't afford to help other countries. A lot of times foreign aid is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  taking from the middle class in one country and giving it to the rich in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=96.8s)]
*  another country and in the case of Israel their debt to GDP is in a better [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=100.64s)]
*  position than our debt to GDP. So I don't particularly with respect to Israel I [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=105.24s)]
*  don't understand why we have to send them money from my constituents in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=111.08s)]
*  Kentucky but I'm not singling them out. Another position that I've taken where [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=115.08s)]
*  I don't single out Israel or any country is I don't support sanctions. I don't [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=119.84s)]
*  think they work. I think they they do punish the people that in the country [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=124.84s)]
*  that you're trying to sanction and they're prelude to war. So and also when [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=129.64s)]
*  you when we write sanctions bills here in the United States we're creating [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=134.96s)]
*  crimes for Americans to commit. You can't go prosecute somebody in a foreign [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=139.32s)]
*  country for violating our sanctions. You're talking about prosecuting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=143.6s)]
*  Americans for engaging in business and finally you know sanctions. By the way I'm [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=147.16s)]
*  talking about isolationism. I've been described as an isolationist. I'm talking [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  about the anti isolationist position which is when you do trade with other [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=156.92s)]
*  countries and finally I guess this would be the America first version for reason [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=161.48s)]
*  for not voting for sanctions as they drive up the price of goods here in the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=167.0s)]
*  United States and limit our options. I've been called to task sorry just to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=171.68s)]
*  wire through sanctions in there is that kind of goes along with the same you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=177.52s)]
*  know basket of votes that I've been criticized on with respect to Israel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=182.52s)]
*  And speaking of just applying this general principle not specific at Israel [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=188.4s)]
*  but to United States foreign policy in general you were one of many people in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=193.88s)]
*  the house who opposed the Biden administration's policy of fueling and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=198.88s)]
*  funding the war in Ukraine. There were five dozen other House Republicans who [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=204.48s)]
*  also did the same. I interviewed several of them on my show about their reasons [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=209.04s)]
*  for opposing that and they said things exactly like you just said. The United [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  States is drowning in debt. We can't take care of our own people. We can't secure [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=218.28s)]
*  our own border. We don't have the money to go around financing wars. It's not a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  good thing if we do so. Ukraine's not the 51st American state. It's not a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=225.2s)]
*  responsibility to pay for their wars and yet all of them that I'm talking about [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=228.56s)]
*  who were on my show opposing US funding of the war in Ukraine suddenly turned [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  around and now are in favor of the Biden administration's request to send another [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  14 billion dollars to Israel. I know you can't speak for your colleagues and I'm [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=241.92s)]
*  not asking you to but why does the climate seem to become so different when [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=246.32s)]
*  the question is funding Israel's wars as opposed to other countries? Well I think [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=252.8s)]
*  there's, you know, just to lay it all out there, I think there's a religious [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=259.2s)]
*  attachment to Israel that you don't see with Ukraine or, gee, I hate to question [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=263.56s)]
*  motives which is what you're asking me to do, you know, in Ukraine it's a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=272.92s)]
*  war between two sets of white people for the most part and it's different in the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=280.2s)]
*  Middle East and I don't, you know, mean to question motives but it seems to be a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=286.6s)]
*  double standard to me. What you're pointing out is there's a double standard. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=295.2s)]
*  I can't speak for all of them why they would support a war in the Middle East [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  and not the war in Ukraine. Here's one of the things that distinguishes Israel [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=303.8s)]
*  and this is something you've talked about and we've covered on our show and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=309.8s)]
*  people have written books about is you have a very very powerful lobby and as [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=313.64s)]
*  I said in the intro, I don't know if you heard, but there's a lot of powerful [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  lobbies in Washington. It's totally legal to be a powerful lobby of the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=320.24s)]
*  pharmaceutical lobby, the Wall Street lobby, the NRA, you know, Planned [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  Parenthood, lots of powerful lobbies in Washington but one of them is this pro [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=328.36s)]
*  Israel lobby led by AIPAC and AIPAC has succeeded before in removing members of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=332.24s)]
*  Congress by financing their primary opponents or financing their general [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=338.0s)]
*  election opponents, people who they perceived as insufficiently supportive [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  of Israel. AIPAC has directly been criticizing you in pretty direct ways [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=345.56s)]
*  and you have been responding in pretty assertive ways as well. Why are you [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=350.56s)]
*  willing to incur the wrath of AIPAC over this issue? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=355.32s)]
*  Well, you know, I think it is debatable as to whether a foreign country and I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=360.32s)]
*  know they're ostensibly Americans who are here that are part of AIPAC but you [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=368.84s)]
*  can still be an American and be working on behalf of a foreign government and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  those people we require to register when they interfere in American politics. So [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=381.44s)]
*  I'm not going to, I actually won't accept the premise that AIPAC has the right to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  interfere in an American election on behalf of a foreign country and if they [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=394.84s)]
*  do, there we have guidelines and guardrails for that which they seem to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=399.96s)]
*  be exempt from and I know they have all sorts of reasons for that. Now back to my [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  particular case, so there have been as of today 18 votes in Congress since [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=410.76s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson was elected. I'm not picking on Speaker Mike Johnson but I'm [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=416.92s)]
*  just pointing out, you know, that's been a short period of time, six weeks. We've [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  had 18 votes on the subject of Israel. We've voted on Israel more times than [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=424.92s)]
*  we've named post offices and you know Congress's favorite thing is to name [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=430.08s)]
*  post offices and the first vote was a vote in support of Israel and it was [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=434.4s)]
*  just a resolution, it wasn't a conveyance of money and I voted against it because [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=442.67999999999995s)]
*  once you read into this resolution, it supported sanctions on Iran. I don't [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=447.79999999999995s)]
*  support sanctions as I've already told you. I don't support expanding the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=454.08s)]
*  conflict like the American response immediately to this conflict between [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=458.4s)]
*  Hamas and the government of Israel was to expand it to Iran and I think [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=464.24s)]
*  that's the opposite of what we need to do. We need to constrain it geographically [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  hopefully and the resolution, it also did other things like open-ended support of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  military assistance without saying that excludes boots on the ground. If you read [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  this with a critical eye, you know, it was hard to vote for so I didn't vote for it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=488.08s)]
*  I was the only Republican who didn't vote for it and then subsequently one of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=492.88s)]
*  the next votes was a vote on 14.3 billion dollars to send to Israel and I didn't [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=499.04s)]
*  vote for that. Well at that point, AIPAC started running ads in my district and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=504.24s)]
*  you know to your point, yeah it's politics. I'm not complaining that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=509.44s)]
*  they're running ads. They want to do it, let them do it. They're wasting [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=515.0s)]
*  somebody's money. They spent 90,000 dollars for two weeks. They put ads on [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=518.56s)]
*  Fox News which is you know what my primary electorate watches largely so [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  they're targeting my primary voters and then they put that on 50,000 dollars of [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=530.56s)]
*  ads on conservative talk radio shows in my district. Then they did some Facebook's [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=537.04s)]
*  you know social media stuff and they were criticizing me for not being [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=542.0s)]
*  supportive enough of Israel. I think it was a waste of their money but then [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=546.96s)]
*  there have been more votes since then and they've attacked me on social media. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=553.36s)]
*  That's fine. They've called me anti-semitic for merely not voting for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=558.08s)]
*  the foreign aid. I said in a tweet that I put America first and they said [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  that invoked some trope and so that I was anti-semitic which I disagree with [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=568.72s)]
*  and then you know recently we had well last week we had a vote on something [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=574.4s)]
*  that supports Israel's right to exist which I do support Israel's right to exist. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  Look Glenn if you want to form an island in the Pacific and create your own country I'll [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=586.8s)]
*  recognize your right to exist. Countries have rights to exist okay but the problem with that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=592.16s)]
*  resolution is that they said it's anti-semitic if you don't recognize their right to exist [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  which I disagree with and there are Jewish people who disagree with that. Hundreds of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=606.72s)]
*  thousands of Jewish people disagree with that and I said you can't equate anti-Zionism with [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=611.44s)]
*  anti-semitism. You know there may be a strong overlap between those people but they're not [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=616.64s)]
*  the same thing. We have different words for them for a reason and then they said well you're saying [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=622.16s)]
*  Israel's right to exist and you're equating that with Zionism and he said that's not exactly what [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=628.08s)]
*  the bill says. Well this week they passed a bill or resolution that says anti-Zionism is [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  anti-semitism like they put it in even more clear words and I found it ironic or not not too ironic. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=640.64s)]
*  I actually wondered where some of these Democrats were for a while but Gerald Nadler of all people [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=648.48s)]
*  gave an impassioned speech about why that why you can't equate those two terms. Who is very [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=655.04s)]
*  pro-Israel and the leading or I think the most senior Jewish member of the house but also somebody [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=661.52s)]
*  very pro-Israel and yeah he came out and said you have Orthodox Jews many of them, sex of them, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=666.72s)]
*  who oppose Zionism on the grounds that it's incompatible with Judaism. But let me ask you [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=672.48s)]
*  independent of whether you agree with that statement or not that anti-Zionism is anti-semitism [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  just on the principle is it the proper role of the U.S. Congress to go around dictating to [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=685.12s)]
*  Americans which views that they might or not might not hold that are racist or bigoted or [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=691.84s)]
*  anti-semitic. Why is that even a proper function for the U.S. Congress at all? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=697.28s)]
*  It's not the irony is you know we're in the Judiciary Committee and we're uncovering all [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=703.36s)]
*  these infringements on the First Amendment that were done at the urging of the government you [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=708.32s)]
*  know through the Twitter files and Michael Schellenberger and Matt Taibbi and we're you [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=714.0s)]
*  know on my weaponization of government committee we've been uncovering that yet I think that's [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=719.84s)]
*  exactly what this is this is an attempt to squelch speech. Now the First Amendment covers the speech [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  you don't like. It covers hateful speech. There are some clear clearly delineated examples of [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=730.16s)]
*  speech that's not protected but anti-Zionism anti-semitism those are actually protected [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=738.88s)]
*  speech. I don't support either of those positions but those are protected forms of speech yet some [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=747.52s)]
*  of these resolutions one of them sought to basically censure Rashida Tlaib a Democrat [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=754.4s)]
*  representative censuring her for words that she said and then another one of these resolutions [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  were sought to go to universities and to add two of the resolutions or amendments said that we were [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=769.04s)]
*  going to defund universities that had anything to do with allowing anti-semitic speech to occur on [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=775.76s)]
*  their campuses so I do believe that's a First Amendment violation when you have the federal [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=781.76s)]
*  government conditioning money based on political positions or allowing certain types of speech [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  and that's been held up in the Supreme Court that is a violation of First Amendment. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0ceLnyuqc&t=796.3199999999999s)]
