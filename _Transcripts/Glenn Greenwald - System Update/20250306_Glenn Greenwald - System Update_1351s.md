# Will DOGE Slash the Pentagon Budget?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M)
*  Project on Government Oversight is a non-profit in Washington, D.C. that investigates waste, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=0.0s)]
*  fraud, and abuse. As a journalist, I've relied on Pogo's investigations for a very long time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=12.0s)]
*  They've investigated Pentagon waste of all types, everything from the $500 hammer that kind of went viral back in the 1980s to more recent failed radar systems, the F-22, the F-35. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=18.0s)]
*  A lot of issues around the Abrams tanks. They've also investigated other federal contracts, the waste, fraud, and abuse that occurred during the pandemic and a lot of those multi-billion dollar rescue packages. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=29.0s)]
*  They've been around for 40 years doing really vital work. And since the topic du jour in Washington is waste, fraud, and abuse, I thought it would be great to talk to Pogo today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=43.0s)]
*  Danielle is the executive director of Pogo. She's an award-winning journalist, really doing cutting-edge work in this regard. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=55.0s)]
*  Danielle, welcome to the program. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=63.0s)]
*  Thanks so much, Lee. It's lovely to be here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=65.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for joining us. Well, I just want to get right to it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=67.0s)]
*  The discussion, the news has been dominated by Elon Musk's Doge effort. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=71.0s)]
*  And, you know, to be frank, I'm of two minds here. It seems like there's been a lot of government contracts, a lot of government bureaucracy that's on autopilot, and it's been difficult to kind of hit the brakes and stop any of this out-of-control spending. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=78.0s)]
*  And you kind of need something radical to shake things up and uproot some of these kind of entrenched problems. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=95.0s)]
*  On the other hand, it looks like Doge has fired people on an arbitrary basis, you know, really just taking a look at any worker, any government scientist or any expert on this kind of probationary period and cutting them, even if they're doing vital work. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=101.0s)]
*  They've gotten things wrong. They've been sloppy. A lot of the awards that they've listed as successful government cuts have been mislabeled and billions should actually have been millions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=117.0s)]
*  And it seems like day after day we're seeing these types of problems. So, you know, it's an interesting area. And just let's get to it. What's your perspective on Doge? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=129.0s)]
*  So you just made so many points in that one little thing that I want to touch on. The first is, yes, their purported mission is a good one, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=139.0s)]
*  I think there's no question that shaking things up and doing things radical is in itself not bad. And I think you're totally right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=149.0s)]
*  We have been trying for decades to get Democrats and Republicans to take seriously the need to provide more accountability and transparency around how money is being spent and whether it should be spent there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=158.0s)]
*  And the problem in this particular case is, though, that you still need to do it by following the law. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=173.0s)]
*  And one of the sort of threshold problems I have is among the things that has happened because of Doge has been essentially making decisions that are not the executive branch's power to make. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=181.0s)]
*  These are programs that have been duly authorized and appropriated by Congress and then to just rip them up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=193.0s)]
*  It's not in the White House or Doge or however we want it to find where they actually sit or whether they're an agency or they're a White House adviser. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=201.0s)]
*  They don't have the power to make that decision. What they should be doing is saying in the next president's budget and work with the Congress to say, we're going to defund these things. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=211.0s)]
*  These are the things that we think need to be cut. That's from a constitutional perspective, the way things should be operating, where it's the Congress's decision ultimately to decide whether a program or an agency should exist, not the executive branch. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=219.0s)]
*  So that's like the 30,000 foot level. And then what is it that they have cut? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=233.0s)]
*  And that's where it really becomes clear to me that not only did they really not care about sort of the constitutional power of the purse being in the Congress, they're not really at least yet serious about cutting waste. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=239.0s)]
*  And I have a few reasons why that's the case. Well, one is that the point you've made is it looks like they wanted to sort of do easy, cheap shots and saying like we cut this program, which it turns out they didn't or they're messing with the millions versus billions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=253.0s)]
*  But the first things they cut, literally, I think the first things that they cut were offices or positions that bring in money to the government, whether it's the inspector's general's offices or it's the CFPB and the IRS. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=269.0s)]
*  Yes, that's not to say that there are not possibly all kinds of efficiencies that could happen with those two agencies, but they and the IGs literally bring in more money than they cost. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=288.0s)]
*  And of course, when it comes to the CFPB, they actually don't cost taxpayers anything. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=299.0s)]
*  So that raises a question. And then what they've targeted in terms of programs are foreign aid. That's a tiny part of the federal budget. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=304.0s)]
*  And now they're looking at the Department of Education, but they explicitly said, and we thought for a minute, the Washington Post reported that the Pentagon was maybe going to get an 8% cut. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=315.0s)]
*  And I perked up my ears. I'm like, OK, now we're talking. And then I said, Oh, well, actually, we're not talking about an 8% cut. It's a shift within the Pentagon budget, which they plan to increase. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=325.0s)]
*  So this is the same old. OK, so now what we've seen is the two agencies that they want to expand their spending on are both the Pentagon and DHS because of their growth or trying to put more money into immigration enforcement. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=336.0s)]
*  And those are two of the agencies that have the biggest slush funds that need the most accountability and to tell them they're essentially off limits from cutting is more evidence to me that they're not really serious about cutting. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=351.0s)]
*  Well, look, I look at some of the contracts that have been cut and it is kind of unclear to me if there is a clear mandate for some of the spending. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=365.0s)]
*  You know, I see this Booz Allen Hamilton or Deloitte contracts on, you know, HR training or DEI training. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=376.0s)]
*  But again, as the critics have pointed out, these are drops in the bucket for the federal budget. The big forms of potential fraud are in Medicare advantage in a lot of these DOD contracts. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=384.0s)]
*  Has Doge spoken to POGO in a proactive way? Is there any kind of cooperative mindset here? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=395.0s)]
*  And I will say that we did testify before the first DOGE committee that's chaired by Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=404.0s)]
*  And in our testimony, we said exactly what you would expect to say. Yes, there's all kinds of things. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=412.0s)]
*  Look here, look at the Pentagon and not just look at the weapons systems, which they should be, and how the weapons get approved to full right production when they haven't passed testing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=418.0s)]
*  And so that's why we keep having weapons that don't work. That is a problem, a legacy problem that has existed since POGO existed 40 years ago. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=429.0s)]
*  But also how we're buying things. And I can get into the weeds on how procurement rules have been largely written by defense contractors to, of course, favor their interests. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=437.0s)]
*  And so what that means is there's a huge percentage of the goods that the Pentagon buys that are, that were essentially subject of price gouging or overpaying for. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=447.0s)]
*  And then there's all the services and that gets to companies like Booz Allen and others where they are vastly overcharging the government for services that if it was a federal employee doing that job, it would be two to three times less expensive to the taxpayer. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=459.0s)]
*  So that's actually is one of the things that was really important that we spoke to in our testimony, which was if you were serious about cutting spending, you wouldn't start with federal employees because those actually for your dollar for dollar are far less expensive than the contractors that we have since essentially the Clinton-Gore era reinventing government started shifting a lot of the work of government to the private sector, to government contractors. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=475.0s)]
*  And the analysis that POGO did that still hasn't been no one else has done a better job than we did in 2011 on that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=503.0s)]
*  We found that a comparison to the taxpayer of a federal employee with a government contractor doing exactly the same work is generally two to three times more expensive to have the contractor. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=510.0s)]
*  And Doge and Musk specifically have been operating under the same misperception that the Clinton-Gore administration did that federal employees are overly expensive and the private sector does things cheaper. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=522.0s)]
*  And the basic weakness in that argument is that might be true if you're talking about the actual private sector, but we're not. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=534.0s)]
*  We're talking about government contractors where their only client is the government. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=543.0s)]
*  And so there isn't a market that's sort of determining prices that they can charge. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=547.0s)]
*  And that's sort of the fundamental problem. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=552.0s)]
*  You know, one thing not to get too technical, but I think this is an important distinction that's getting lost in the discourse. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=554.0s)]
*  We're seeing the president and some of his supporters say that waste and fraud is being cut. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=560.0s)]
*  Waste is a subjective term. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=566.0s)]
*  You know, one person's waste could be another person's vital program. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=568.0s)]
*  But fraud has a technical definition. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=572.0s)]
*  It's breaking the law. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=575.0s)]
*  It's stealing money. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=576.0s)]
*  It's things that are violations of the federal statute or the certifications of federal contracts. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=578.0s)]
*  Could you talk a little bit about this distinction? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=583.0s)]
*  Because so far, one could argue that, yes, Doge is cutting waste. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=585.0s)]
*  We can get into that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=591.0s)]
*  But you've already kind of talked a little bit about that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=593.0s)]
*  But what is this distinction with fraud? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=596.0s)]
*  Do you believe that this Department of Justice is going to work with the inspector generals or with others to actually claw back some of the misappropriated funds or illegally obtained funds? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=598.0s)]
*  Because there is a difference here. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=608.0s)]
*  There's absolutely a difference. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=610.0s)]
*  It's a really good point that you're making, Lee. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=611.0s)]
*  And I do want to emphasize, you know, what they are arguing is waste. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=613.0s)]
*  Any DEI program, any foreign aid, those absolutely are policy decisions on whether, you know, those are not those are. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=618.0s)]
*  So in my in my in my estimation, that is not how you would define waste. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=627.0s)]
*  I define waste by sort of the legalized corruption where we are paying far too much for something that we may actually want to be buying. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=634.0s)]
*  It's just we're paying too much for it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=642.0s)]
*  But our systems have allowed it to happen. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=643.0s)]
*  That's not breaking any law. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=645.0s)]
*  Our systems let it happen. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=646.0s)]
*  Now, when it comes to fraud, I would argue they so far haven't identified anything that I would calculate was fraud. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=648.0s)]
*  And if anything, what we're seeing in terms of the other offices at DOJ specifically, that they're either beheading or shrinking or entire programs like the Foreign Correct Practices Act that they're saying, you know what, we're going to we're going to be scaling back our enforcement. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=655.0s)]
*  We're going to scale back our enforcement on the public integrity section. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=672.0s)]
*  We're going to scale by, you know, we're scaling back literally the kinds of fraud fighting efforts by DOJ very explicitly. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=675.0s)]
*  They're talking about very just yesterday tweeted that they're not going to be enforcing the what's the CTA stand for the Corporate Transparency Act. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=685.0s)]
*  So they're they're not hiding the fact that the best fraud fighting laws and offices are those things that they are targeting to weaken. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=696.0s)]
*  You know, just to kind of spin out this argument a little bit, you know, for a lot of conservatives, they looked at the last four years. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=705.0s)]
*  They say, OK, look, we had this out of control spending on the pandemic, on the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=714.0s)]
*  We have all this inflation from government spending. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=719.0s)]
*  Democrats and progressives talk a good game about clawing back fraud and waste, but it seems like there there weren't that many proactive efforts. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=722.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's a fair critique. I want to hear your perspective on that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=731.0s)]
*  I will say that I I rejected the legitimacy of the decision to essentially give a waiver to a huge percentage of the improperly gained PPP loans. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=735.0s)]
*  You know, there was there was a real opportunity to capture a lot of the funds that were not used as intended. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=751.0s)]
*  But unfortunately, and I have to admit, I don't remember whether it was at the end of the Trump. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=762.0s)]
*  I do think it was at the end of the Trump administration and not the beginning of the Biden administration that they essentially gave a waiver because the argument they made was it was going to be too labor intensive to track down all the information to determine whether the the the loans were legitimately spent or not. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=767.0s)]
*  I think that was that was a terrible mistake. And and I do believe that was under Trump and not Biden. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=786.0s)]
*  I would also say that when we look at the federal budget and and the deficits, it's not I don't think you can honestly say that looking at those numbers that it is the Democrats that are vastly overspending the Republicans that are not. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=792.0s)]
*  That's another one of these myths that that when you actually look at the numbers, this is just not actually how it works out. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=807.0s)]
*  And I think when it comes to inflation, I do know enough to know that it's more complicated than being able to play one president or another. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=813.0s)]
*  So those are I mean, I think it's really smart and honest and true to say that is a problem. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=820.0s)]
*  It's impacting real people. And there are there economic policies that can be helping the population when there's inflation. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=826.0s)]
*  And I don't know that I see that the Democrat or Republicans better or worse on those things. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=837.0s)]
*  Well, fair enough. You know, one other issue that I know Pogo is a leader on is really taking a fine tooth comb to what the inspector generals are all doing. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=842.0s)]
*  You know, each agency for the viewers who do not know this has its own kind of quasi independent watchdog to kind of help police waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=851.0s)]
*  And they produce reports that then become recommendations to the public and to prosecutors for how to clean up certain problems that each agency. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=860.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of people don't pay attention to what each IG is doing. I know your group is doing it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=868.0s)]
*  One thing that really blew my mind, I feel it is one of the most important historical records of the 20 year American War in Afghanistan are the special inspector general John Sopko's reports on the Afghanistan War. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=872.0s)]
*  If you just want to see kind of a cathedral to government waste, fraud and abuse, it's these reports on the Afghanistan War. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=886.0s)]
*  I mean, billions of dollars to highways that went nowhere to schools that were half built to, you know, poorly trained Afghan police and military that were completely unprepared to take on the job of governing that society. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=893.0s)]
*  I mean, the list, it's a laundry list of hundreds of thousands of failed and fraudulent programs, money stolen by both Afghans and American and European contractors. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=906.0s)]
*  It's exhausting to look at. And I look at this and I have two questions for you. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=917.0s)]
*  One, why don't we apply the same kind of rigor and aggressive nature of the special inspector general of Afghanistan and apply it back to the Pentagon and other parts of the US government? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=922.0s)]
*  We know we have these investigative and audit related skills. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=934.0s)]
*  And second, are you concerned that we have a similar kind of mountain of fraud in Ukraine where the Biden administration initially opposed a similar special inspector general for Ukraine? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=938.0s)]
*  Now there is one, but it's not clear if it's really rooting out fraud in the same way that the Afghanistan investigation had. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=950.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm not giving it enough time. It's relatively new. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=956.0s)]
*  But wanted to get your perspective on those issues. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=959.0s)]
*  I think it's great to call out the fantastic work that John did. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=963.0s)]
*  And not only is it a cathedral to waste and fraud, but it's also a cathedral to really good investigations by an IG who did a fantastic job of alerting the public and the Congress to problems. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=966.0s)]
*  It's not his fault that they weren't acting on his findings. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=978.0s)]
*  I will say that I only wish every IG were as good as John Sopko were. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=982.0s)]
*  I mean, they have much bigger offices, the agency IGs than he has. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=989.0s)]
*  So it's not as though he had more resources than they do. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=994.0s)]
*  So I would say he does fantastic work. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=998.0s)]
*  The difference with his special IG function was that it was a whole of government approach. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1001.0s)]
*  It wasn't just what is one agency spending and how is that program working. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1007.0s)]
*  It was looking across the agencies, which in something like a contingency zone, which is what they call war zones, is much more valuable to have a sense of how are the pieces all fitting together. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1012.0s)]
*  And frankly, we're not the equivalent when it comes to Ukraine is still assuming that the Pentagon IG is the lead IG. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1024.0s)]
*  They are working with other IGs like the State Department and AID. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1032.0s)]
*  But it's not a special IG with that whole of government approach. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1037.0s)]
*  So I don't anticipate that were they all actually to be currently still active with Senate confirmed heads that they would have the same success that he would. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1042.0s)]
*  But I know for a fact it's not going to happen now because they were all fired at the beginning of the Trump administration. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1052.0s)]
*  And I'll say that's one of the great strengths of the inspector general system had been that they had a level of independence from a president that they felt empowered to raise concerns, to raise the bad news that an agency doesn't want the public or a president to know. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1059.0s)]
*  They've all been fired now, except two. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1081.0s)]
*  And I think in some ways the fact that he explicitly didn't fire the two IGs that he fairly or not perceived were politically valuable to him. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1085.0s)]
*  In the case of the Justice Department's inspector general, he said, well, I didn't fire Horowitz because I really liked his report that he did about Comey. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1097.0s)]
*  That's not a reason why you should keep an inspector general. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1105.0s)]
*  And of course, the DHS inspector general, Khafari, has a long line. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1108.0s)]
*  We have been arguing he's maybe the worst inspector general in my life's experience working in this. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1114.0s)]
*  And he was politically advantageous to the president as well. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1120.0s)]
*  So those offices have now been told we need to just bring up the good news that's going to make the president happy or we're going to get fired. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1124.0s)]
*  So I think unless we are collectively successful demonstrating that they should they were illegally fired, I think those offices are largely made toothless. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1132.0s)]
*  And just one final question. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1146.0s)]
*  I know Pogo has I don't know if it's a lawsuit or a challenge to Doge for some of their records, for some of the personnel that are working with those. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1148.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask if you could just explain that whole challenge to Doge. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1156.0s)]
*  And then is there any kind of prospect for collaborative accountability? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1160.0s)]
*  Because, you know, too often these efforts become partisan affairs where one side is accusing the other, where there is certainly a public interest here. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1165.0s)]
*  There is an opportunity for broad minded reform. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1174.0s)]
*  Do you see it? And what are your recommendations to Doge in that respect? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1176.0s)]
*  So our suit is simply around transparency, that they were originally designated and the president has changed how he describes whether Doge is an advisor to the president in the White House or is it, you know, the different circumstances that it exists. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1179.0s)]
*  And the reason that matters is that the President, Presidential Records Act allows an office within the White House to not be subject to the Freedom of Information Act for 12 years. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1198.0s)]
*  And what we're arguing is given the work that they're doing, they are acting as an agency. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1210.0s)]
*  And that means the Presidential Records Act does not apply. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1215.0s)]
*  It's the Federal Records Act, which does allow for FOIA or the Freedom of Information Act. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1218.0s)]
*  And so that is what our lawsuit is, is to say you are operating, you are not, they want to have the PRA, Presidential Records Act, apply and we're saying, no, that's not what applies. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1224.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of other organizations that have filed FOIA lawsuits and they're essentially, I think, going to have to wait until our case makes it up to demonstrate that actually FOIA should apply because of that particular law. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1234.0s)]
*  So that's what we're doing. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1247.0s)]
*  So we're not, it's not on the merits of their work, just to make sure that we can, we collectively can see what it is that they're doing. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1249.0s)]
*  And I absolutely want and continue to hope that, you know, this is, we have been nonpartisan from our origins and waste is one of the places where there has always been an alignment between the parties. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1257.0s)]
*  But as you've pointed out, one person's waste is not the same as in others. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1270.0s)]
*  But I did take it, you know, as a great opportunity for us to be able to testify before Marjorie Taylor Greene's committee and say, yes, this is, these are the places we want to look at them. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1274.0s)]
*  And we haven't, you know, we have not at all been encouraged by what DOJ has done yet. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1284.0s)]
*  We did, we did submit suggestions of places where they should be looking and we're not, you know, we're not hearing back from them, but we'll sit down with anyone and say, this is what you should be doing. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1293.0s)]
*  And I hope maybe at some point soon they learn their lesson that the way they're going about things is, is, is, you know, likely illegal and so far kind of incompetent. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1304.0s)]
*  And we have a roadmap that could help them be successful if they wanted to. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1314.0s)]
*  Okay, great. Well, Danielle, thank you again for your time and for all the work that you do. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEd5BRKvW0M&t=1318.0s)]
