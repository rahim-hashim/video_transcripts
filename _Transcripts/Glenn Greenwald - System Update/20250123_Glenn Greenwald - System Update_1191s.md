# "Stabbed in the Eye" Hoax: How the Pro-Israel Right Weaponizes Victimhood
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y)
*  And now here we have the cause of free speech, which in so many ways has been the principle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  defining cause of the conservative movement in the United States over the last 10 years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=13.72s)]
*  It's certainly something that I spent a lot of time defending them for because I believe [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=19.6s)]
*  they were on the right side of that view when it came to the grievances they expressed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=22.76s)]
*  And we gained a lot of conservative audience because of the free speech banner that I've [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=28.12s)]
*  been waving my entire adult life versus a lawyer and now as a journalist. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=32.88s)]
*  There are a lot of people who wave that banner who only believe in that quote unquote principle [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  insofar as it defends the people with whom they disagree. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=43.72s)]
*  And the minute they see that the people with whom they most disagree are being silenced [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  or declared guilty of hate speech or otherwise being sanctioned or punished, they drop that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=52.48s)]
*  flag and burn a hole in it and they start invoking the exact rationale of left liberal [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  censors to justify why, oh, this isn't really speech, this is words are violence or it's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=63.64s)]
*  incitement to violence. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  And we've seen so much of that the people who have gotten so rich branding themselves [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=72.0s)]
*  as free speech advocates, the Barry Weisses and Ben Shapiro of the world and Dave Rubens, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=76.68s)]
*  who to the extent they care at all about free speech, care infinitely more than the state [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=82.48s)]
*  of Israel and are far more willing to renounce free speech in order to shield that foreign [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=86.4s)]
*  country that they love than they are willing to do almost anything else. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=90.92s)]
*  For so long we heard that Harvard was this bastion of left wing thought that the only [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=96.4s)]
*  thing they censored is conservative speech and yet because of all the pressure put on [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=101.68s)]
*  Harvard by Congress, led by people like Elise Stefanik who Trump then as a reward named [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=107.76s)]
*  to be the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., think about that, the Congress had an inquisition [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=113.76s)]
*  to determine whether or not there was too much criticism of Israel being allowed on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  college campuses. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=123.76s)]
*  These colleges, because they have so many major donors as well who are fanatical supporters [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=126.12s)]
*  of Israel, felt pressure both from the government and from the billionaire class to start curbing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=131.36s)]
*  the right of faculty members and students to criticize the state of Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=141.36s)]
*  A direct blow not just to the values of free speech but to the core concept of academic [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=145.96s)]
*  freedom on which academia depends to be valuable. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  The idea that once you're an academic you can explore any taboo, you can play with any [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=154.28000000000003s)]
*  idea and you're not supposed to be fired. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=158.82s)]
*  Like so many principles conservatives claim to have, not all but many, there's a gigantic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=162.9s)]
*  Israel exception right in the middle of it that basically makes it all a farce and an [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=167.7s)]
*  illusion and come crumbling down upon the slightest scrutiny or the most minimal test. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=173.06s)]
*  Somehow Harvard today was pressured and forced to launch one of the most direct assaults [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=182.34s)]
*  on free speech on a college campus and one of the most subversive assaults on academic [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=189.74s)]
*  freedom in the name of protecting the state of Israel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  This college that we're always told is some aggressively left-wing communist anti-Semitic [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  institution now has just adopted a definition of anti-Semitism and hate speech designed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  to outlaw and punish and criminalize students at Harvard or faculty at Harvard who are critical [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=212.42s)]
*  of the state of Israel's report the cause of Palestine. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=219.34s)]
*  Here from the Harvard Crimson, the college's newspaper from today, there you see the date, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=222.78s)]
*  Jewish students sue, I'm sorry this is from January of 2024, this is the event that got [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=229.34s)]
*  the ball rolling. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=235.3s)]
*  Jewish students sue Harvard University, allege quote, severe anti-Semitism on campus. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=236.58s)]
*  One of the other conservative grievances over the last decade almost is unifying and central [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=245.74s)]
*  as the complaint about censorship has been the constant mockery of every minority group [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=250.06s)]
*  for claiming that they're not safe on college campuses, that there's systemic discrimination [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=257.38s)]
*  against them, black groups, black students say it, Latino groups say it, Muslim groups [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=261.74s)]
*  say it, women groups say it, trans people or LGBT say it, and to be a conservative [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=267.74s)]
*  basically means to mock it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=273.86s)]
*  Oh, you're just trying to self-victimize, you're constantly dividing yourself up and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  segregating yourself into these little categories and then you want censorship to prevent ideas [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=280.22s)]
*  that make you uncomfortable because you've been learned and trained to be little babies. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=287.38s)]
*  And that's all we've seen since October 7th on college campuses, Jewish students using [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=293.78s)]
*  exactly those tactics and those narratives to claim that they're uniquely persecuted [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=297.5s)]
*  and besieged, these poor students at Harvard and Penn and Yale who come from the wealthiest [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=303.82s)]
*  families whose parents are Goldman Sachs partners and tycoons and billionaires, that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=308.74s)]
*  they're uniquely persecuted, they don't feel safe because they see Palestinian flags being [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  waved, and six of them sued Harvard, one of them was invited to speak at the RNC about [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=319.98s)]
*  how he stood up to Harvard for allowing anti-Semitism and was given a hero's welcome at the Republican [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=325.1s)]
*  National Committee. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=330.62s)]
*  The people who hate victimhood narratives and identity politics and attempts to censor [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=332.58000000000004s)]
*  could not have been more enthusiastic for someone doing exactly that but in the name [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  of Israel and Jewish students rather than any of the other minority groups they typically [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=342.34s)]
*  scorn. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=346.5s)]
*  Here from the Harvard newspaper reporting on that lawsuit, quote, six Jewish students [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=347.5s)]
*  filed a federal lawsuit against Harvard on Wednesday alleging that the university has [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=351.74s)]
*  failed to address, quote, severe and pervasive anti-Semitism on campus. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=356.5s)]
*  I mean if you know anything about Harvard, who runs it, who funds it, who's on the faculty [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=360.9s)]
*  there, Alan Dershowitz is a perfectly representative example. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=367.9s)]
*  Who goes there, who has been disproportionately represented there for decades, the idea that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=374.17999999999995s)]
*  Harvard is a cesspool of anti-Semitism to the point where Jewish students or Israel supporters [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=378.73999999999995s)]
*  are physically endangered is too laughable to even say with a straight face. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=384.58s)]
*  I barely got through that sentence with that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=388.26s)]
*  It goes on, quote, the nearly 80 page suit filed on behalf of the students by Donnelly, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=391.17999999999995s)]
*  Conrad, Gelhard and Kazowitz, Benson and Torres in the US District Court in Boston [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=395.98s)]
*  alleges that Harvard's, quote, delivered interference and, quote, enabling of anti-Semitism violates [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=402.1s)]
*  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=407.3s)]
*  Only one plaintiff in the complaint, Harvard Divinity School student Shabazz Alexander [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  Kastenbaum, who you might recall we interviewed on this show, he was also a prime time speaker [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=415.42s)]
*  at the Republican National Committee, is named while the other five students are identified [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=420.88s)]
*  as members of a nonprofit organization, the Students Against Anti-Semitism. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=426.28s)]
*  Quote, it's become so unbearable, so unbearable at college campuses, this was our only option, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=429.64s)]
*  said Kastenbaum. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=436.8s)]
*  The suit documents numerous allegations of anti-Semitism at Harvard's campus, specifically [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=438.36s)]
*  naming several student groups, including Harvard BDS, Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=443.28s)]
*  Harvard Islamic Society and the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Student Solidarity Committee, which [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=448.52s)]
*  penned the original statement calling Israel, quote, entirely responsible for the October [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=453.74s)]
*  7th attacks. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=457.84s)]
*  You don't have to like that view that Israel is responsible for the October 7th attacks. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  It's obviously a perfectly protected view to have, just like people can argue that the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=465.24s)]
*  US provoked the Russian war in Ukraine. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  People can argue that the United States provoked the war in Vietnam through the Gulf of Tonkin [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=473.68s)]
*  lies. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=478.32s)]
*  These are all historical valid opinions that people debate all the time, but not on Harvard. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=479.32s)]
*  And by the way, I had that student on my show, Kastenbaum, who brought this lawsuit, and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=484.48s)]
*  I asked him multiple times, were you ever personally physically attacked by anybody? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=488.48s)]
*  Were you physically menaced by anybody? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=492.8s)]
*  Were you physically threatened by anybody? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=494.52s)]
*  The answer to all those questions was no. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=496.12s)]
*  Took a lot of prying to get that clear answer, but that was the answer, because all of this [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=497.84s)]
*  discomfort and being unsafe comes from hearing ideas that they dislike. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=504.04s)]
*  And the whole conservative mockery was based on this phrase, words are not violence. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=510.36s)]
*  And yet, all of this, this whole moral panic over the supposed extreme marginalization [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=513.84s)]
*  and persecution of American Jews, I have a guest on my show saying, I know Jews in New [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=519.6s)]
*  York that can't even safely walk on the street, has all been based on the idea that having [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  to see a flag that you disagree with, having to hear a political chant you find upsetting, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=529.78s)]
*  is something that institutions need to protect you from by putting a stop to those ideas, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=536.22s)]
*  exactly what the conservative movement has been, viciously ridiculing and depicting as [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=541.06s)]
*  repressive for over a decade, with my support. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=546.5s)]
*  It's just that I believe in that principle in all cases, not just some. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=550.9s)]
*  The Harvard Crimson in May reported this, quote, the Brandeis Center accuses Harvard [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=556.4s)]
*  of quote, deliberately ignoring anti-Semitism in lawsuit. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=562.54s)]
*  Here's another lawsuit brought by Harvard, quote, in the 72 page complaint, the plaintiff [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=565.8s)]
*  said the university quote, allowed anti-Semitism and anti-Israel sentiment to fester. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=570.3s)]
*  How can you not allow anti-Israel sentiment to fester at a college that guarantees free [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=578.62s)]
*  speech and academic freedom? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=584.84s)]
*  Are you supposed to ban anti-Israel sentiment, only permit pro-Israel adoration? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=586.5s)]
*  That's the foundation, the premise of all of this. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=592.1s)]
*  The lawsuit alleged they allowed anti-Israeli sentiment to fester following October 7th [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=595.9s)]
*  and criticized its decision not to condemn a statement published by the Harvard undergraduate [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  at the Palestine Solidarity Committee in October 23, calling Israel's quote, entirely responsible [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=605.44s)]
*  for the attack. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=610.44s)]
*  So much of the hysteria over the most privileged people on the planet, Ivy League students [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=611.44s)]
*  being unsafe suddenly, never black students, Latino students, women, trans people, immigrants, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=629.5600000000001s)]
*  Muslims, they're never unsafe. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=637.44s)]
*  If they talk about being unsafe, they're just whiny, they're little snowflakes who can't [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=639.64s)]
*  handle disagreement. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=644.88s)]
*  But Jewish students at Yale and Harvard coming from Greenwich, Connecticut, talk about being [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=645.88s)]
*  unsafe. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=652.6s)]
*  This is the real crisis. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=653.6s)]
*  That's when we need to re-evaluate free speech. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=655.92s)]
*  And this is all accomplished by a series of claims about things that happened that were [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=658.4399999999999s)]
*  completely fictitious or totally laughable to support the claim that Jewish students [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=664.92s)]
*  were widely unsafe on American college campuses. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=670.04s)]
*  Here from Fox News in April of 2024, a Jewish Yale student were stabbed in the eye with [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=672.8s)]
*  a Palestinian flag during a rowdy protest. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=679.36s)]
*  Quote mob behavior, Sahar Tartak said the estelant disappeared into the crowd and remains [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=683.5999999999999s)]
*  unpunished. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=689.02s)]
*  Now obviously, that's a very disturbing image. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=691.02s)]
*  This woman was at a protest, this Jewish woman, someone walked up to her and stabbed her in [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=695.02s)]
*  the eye with a Palestinian flag, like the pointed part of the flag. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=699.5s)]
*  He stabbed her in the eye, the eye is so sensitive. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=702.5799999999999s)]
*  You have a very sharp flagpole repeatedly and violently entering your eye. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=705.66s)]
*  As my third grade teacher used to say about spitballs, you can really lose an eye only [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=714.22s)]
*  in that case it's really true. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=718.22s)]
*  The problem was the story was completely invented. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=721.38s)]
*  It was a Jesse Smollett level hoax spread by obviously the free press and Barry Weiss [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=723.46s)]
*  and that whole crowd. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=728.32s)]
*  The next day, Sahar Tartak, the woman who was stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=729.86s)]
*  flag, went on Piers Morgan and her eyes were looking suspiciously vibrant and healthy and [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=734.14s)]
*  unwounded. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=742.02s)]
*  And you couldn't help notice. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=743.98s)]
*  So here's that conversation. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=745.38s)]
*  I've made a serious effort to receive direct protection from the university and have an [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=746.98s)]
*  escort on a regular basis, but the university has in the past failed and is continuing to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=752.84s)]
*  not provide me with that direct protection. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=760.82s)]
*  And so to be really quite honest with you, I don't know what I will do because I have [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=763.62s)]
*  seen hundreds of students organize to call for the genocide of me and my people. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=767.46s)]
*  And I have seen hundreds of students taunt visibly Jewish students live and in person [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=774.62s)]
*  at these rallies. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=780.86s)]
*  My peers are, I'm frightened by them to be frank. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=784.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh, but like what about the thing where you were stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=787.18s)]
*  flag that's why you're on these shows? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=790.62s)]
*  Trans people claim their censorship needed because people call for their eradication [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=794.22s)]
*  and genocide. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=797.42s)]
*  The whole reason you're on these shows and we're talking about you is because you were [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=800.0600000000001s)]
*  claimed you were stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag was supposed to be an example. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=803.58s)]
*  Finally, a concrete example of actual physical assault of a Jewish student, a violent, vicious [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=807.74s)]
*  one. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=814.14s)]
*  I mean, who stabs people in the eye with a pointed end of a flag? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=815.14s)]
*  And yet here she is with her two lovely little eyes. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=819.82s)]
*  And I wouldn't say lovely, they're kind of spaced apart a little oddly, but I mean, they're [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=821.9000000000001s)]
*  unharmed. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=825.1800000000001s)]
*  And here's the rest of what she said. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=827.0200000000001s)]
*  And I should be because I've been assaulted once. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=828.62s)]
*  And I don't see why it shouldn't happen again, because it's being organized and encouraged [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=831.18s)]
*  and protected by the rallies themselves and by the rally organizers themselves. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=835.3399999999999s)]
*  Again, when a student assaulted me by jabbing me in the eye, what happened afterwards was [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=841.26s)]
*  that the human blockade of protest organizers of student leaders in these anti-Semitic rallies. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=846.22s)]
*  So she went on other shows as well and they were like, hey, you know, your eye seems like [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=853.5s)]
*  pretty good. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=857.62s)]
*  And she would say, yeah, just ended up kind of like brushing against it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=860.74s)]
*  When we saw the video finally, that's exactly what it was. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=864.1800000000001s)]
*  Somebody was waving a flag like they do when you're in a march. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=866.58s)]
*  She was standing over here and it's kind of like swept against her. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=869.28s)]
*  And that turned into the Jesse Small level hoax. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=872.74s)]
*  She was stabbed in the eye. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=874.86s)]
*  Unfortunately for her, she didn't even bother to wear an eye patch to get her some sympathy. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=876.1s)]
*  She just like, I guess, was too vain to do that, wanted to go on and show her and her [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=880.82s)]
*  vibrant self. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=884.74s)]
*  And yet, it wasn't very consistent with the story that much of the very tight, weiss type [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=885.74s)]
*  press had been spreading to try and finally justify this claim that Jewish students were [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=890.42s)]
*  unsafe for reasons other than hearing ideas. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=894.86s)]
*  Here was a protest at the University of Washington in which students were exercising their First [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=898.08s)]
*  Amendment right, their free speech right to march in defense of the Palestinian cause [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=904.92s)]
*  and opposed to the Israeli destruction of Gaza. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=908.54s)]
*  And here's how one Jewish student reacted when seeing this completely nonviolent protest. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=913.72s)]
*  You'll see it in the background. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=919.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just people walking around with signs like every protest does. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  But she had been fed on this paranoia, this narrative of paranoia that Jews were so unsafe [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=924.76s)]
*  they can't even walk out on the street. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=932.0s)]
*  Look at the neurosis and hysteria this caused in this poor woman at the mere fact that a [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=933.9200000000001s)]
*  protest against Israel was permitted on her campus. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=941.76s)]
*  Please, please end it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=972.76s)]
*  Please, please. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=974.76s)]
*  They're just like walking in circles with signs. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=975.76s)]
*  Now, she became a folk hero on pro-Israel social media. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=978.76s)]
*  Imagine if that had been a trans woman begging and weeping and sobbing security guards to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=984.76s)]
*  stop a protest where people were just walking with signs saying they're only two genders. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=991.52s)]
*  Or if it had been a black person begging for an anti-affirmative action, protests to stop. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=997.08s)]
*  Conservatives would be deriding those people today as pathetic little neurotic snowflakes [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1006.36s)]
*  who need therapy. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1011.76s)]
*  But this woman, she was an example, a noble example of just how assaulted, under danger, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1012.76s)]
*  Jewish students in America are. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1024.28s)]
*  There was actually a free press article promoted by Barry Weiss that I saw just before I came [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1025.68s)]
*  on the show that said, the unspeakable plight of Canadian Jews. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1030.44s)]
*  And I just, well, no, it was Canadian Jews under Justin Trudeau that I'll show you about [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1035.68s)]
*  one day, what she thinks are the unspeakable horrors of Canadian Jews. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1042.64s)]
*  I'll give you a hint. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1047.64s)]
*  The world's most powerful and richest country in all of human history did not pay another [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1049.2s)]
*  military to carpet bomb their communities in Canada and to reduce their entire neighborhoods [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1055.68s)]
*  to rubble and purposely destroy all their schools, hospitals, and places of worship [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1060.52s)]
*  and prevent food from getting in and medicine so they die of famine and treatable infections [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1068.02s)]
*  and diseases. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1075.28s)]
*  Nor did they ethnically cleanse them from one part of Canada to the next by forcing [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1077.04s)]
*  them to go leave their homes to go trek to another side of Canada only to then start [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1080.6399999999999s)]
*  bombing that one repeatedly throughout the war. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1085.28s)]
*  None of that happened, but it was an unspeakable plight of what's happening to Canadian Jews [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1087.76s)]
*  that Barry Weiss has so empathetically uncovered. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1090.96s)]
*  And this is the kind of thing that has been permeating our culture. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1095.52s)]
*  There is evidence that suggests, and you can read it in journals, that drinking two to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1100.68s)]
*  three cups of coffee in the morning can slash your risk of death by 29% and cut your chances [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vts5RuHIj_Y&t=1103.8s)]
