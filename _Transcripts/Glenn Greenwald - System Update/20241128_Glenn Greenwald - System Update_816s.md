# How This Dog Went From Fearful To Faithful: System Pupdate Rescue Stories Premiere
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY)
*  All right, as many of you know, the act of rescuing dogs and taking care of them and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=0.0s)]
*  treating their health problems and trying to nurture them out of abuse and mistrust [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  issues that they have because of their past lives that you typically don't know, but [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  can guess that when you rescue them is a very important part of my life and my family's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  life. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=27.68s)]
*  As I said at the start, we have 26 rescue dogs at home, which I know sounds like I'm [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=28.8s)]
*  a crazy person when I say it, but we have a house where it's kind of constructed on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=32.48s)]
*  purpose the outdoor space to accommodate that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=37.56s)]
*  It's something that is a great source of happiness and fulfillment for us, not just having the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=40.2s)]
*  dogs but the act of rescuing dogs. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=46.28s)]
*  And then we did as head gets to the point where 26 dogs even for us was a bit too much. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=48.64s)]
*  We knew we weren't going to stop rescuing dogs in the street. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=52.96s)]
*  There's a lot of strays on the street. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=55.24s)]
*  So we opened a shelter, an NGO for dogs where we have about another 175 where we have a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  staff of primarily homeless people who have lived on the streets with their dogs where [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=64.24s)]
*  they themselves bring their dogs and then try and place the other dogs that we have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  there for placement, for adoption. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=73.2s)]
*  And we've adopted and placed for adoption, I don't know, hundreds, if not close to a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=76.12s)]
*  thousand dogs over the last 10 years or so through this shelter. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=79.96s)]
*  And one of the ideas we had, because whenever I see content on the internet about dogs, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=85.12s)]
*  is I realized that every dog is so idiosyncratically different. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  You talk to anyone with a dog who rescued them off the street or from the shelter. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=93.48s)]
*  They'll all tell you, my dog chose me. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=97.28s)]
*  They'll all tell you about the unique idiosyncratic personality traits of their dogs, which is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=99.88s)]
*  absolutely true because dogs are evolved to adopt to humans. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=103.88s)]
*  But the act of rescuing a dog itself is incredibly profound. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  A lot of people think when you do it, you're engaging in an act of charity or benevolence [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=113.56s)]
*  because you're helping the dog and maybe that is true to some extent, but I can assure you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=118.16s)]
*  as someone who's done it so many times, they do as much for you as you do for them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=122.76s)]
*  The fulfillment they give you, the understanding that you've rescued them, the role that they [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=127.6s)]
*  start playing in your life and your family's life and your kid's life is something that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=132.88s)]
*  is at least as much as what you've done for them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=137.76s)]
*  We've been talking about that a lot on the after show. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  Just started doing a quick segment at the end of each show that ends the week. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  Usually that'll be Friday because of the holiday. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  It'll be tonight where we just spend about five or six, seven minutes narrating every [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=150.44s)]
*  story of the rescue dogs in our home, but also the ones in our shelter because some [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=155.12s)]
*  of these stories are absolutely amazing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=160.68s)]
*  The way in which these dogs were rescued, the things they had to overcome, the way they've [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=163.18s)]
*  contributed to people's lives. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=168.1s)]
*  I just want to say I think a lot of people obviously love their dogs, but sometimes think [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=169.1s)]
*  even for people who don't, oh, this is just a nice uplifting dog story. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=175.82s)]
*  One of the things I think is so important and my now deceased husband who was in the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=180.38s)]
*  Brazilian Congress used to always point this out that how a society treats its animals, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=185.1s)]
*  how a society treats its dogs, it's not just about, oh, dogs deserve love and support and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  therefore they should have it because then people say, well, there's so many humans suffering. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=195.78s)]
*  Why would you prioritize dogs over them? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=199.38s)]
*  And the answer is because the less cruelty we have toward dogs, the more as a society [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=201.78s)]
*  and as a species we connect to dogs and to other animals, it improves our society as [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=206.74s)]
*  well. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=211.86s)]
*  Lots of enlightenment philosophers, pre-enlightenment philosophers even have often observed that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=212.86s)]
*  society is more degraded. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=218.34s)]
*  It's cruder when people are encouraged to be cruel to dogs, when they're encouraged [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=221.9s)]
*  to be loving with dogs and form relationships with dogs, they become happier, their families [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=226.86s)]
*  become happier, the society improves as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=231.38s)]
*  And so we think it's a little bit more than just some lighthearted nice way to end the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=236.26s)]
*  show, but if you think it's only that, that's fine too. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=240.1s)]
*  We do very intense, often heavy political content throughout the entire week and so [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=242.96s)]
*  ending our week with a five to seven minute segment on each one of these dogs, their trajectory, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=247.94s)]
*  their story, I think is a great way to end the week. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=254.42s)]
*  The segment title, I wish I could claim credit for, but someone on our team did is called [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=256.94s)]
*  system pup date. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=261.7s)]
*  I think it might've actually been even a viewer of ours in the locals community who came up [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=263.74s)]
*  with this title as we were talking about it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=267.78s)]
*  And the dog that we're going to begin with is a dog very known to the viewers of our [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=270.22s)]
*  after show because every after show we typically have two or three canine co-hosts. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=275.5s)]
*  We bring three different dogs, kind of trying to rotate them so it's fair. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  And that dog is Sylvester. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=283.94s)]
*  Unfortunately Sylvester passed away very suddenly, actually, sadly the day I was traveling in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=286.06s)]
*  the U.S. and he had an aneurysm the day before I got back and I only learned of that once [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=291.02s)]
*  I got back. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=296.58s)]
*  But you learn to focus on the fact that even though dogs have shorter life cycles, all [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=297.58s)]
*  you can hope for for a dog is that they have the best possible life, which for a dog means [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=302.9s)]
*  a lot of human connection, a lot of human love. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=308.34s)]
*  And he certainly had that so I don't consider this a sad story. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=310.86s)]
*  The rescue itself was very unusual and here is the story of Sylvester. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=313.7s)]
*  Hey everyone, it's Glenn Greenwald and we are really thrilled to introduce our new series [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=317.98s)]
*  which every week we're going to have a guest starring dog where we're going to tell you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=322.14s)]
*  about their trajectory, their history of being rescued, their personality. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=326.34s)]
*  We have 26 dogs at home, all rescues, another 150 in the shelter and each week you're going [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=330.28s)]
*  to meet a new one. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  Here I am excited to present our guest starring dog of the week. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  Hey everybody, I'm here with the guest starring dog of the week. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  His name is Sylvester. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=346.0s)]
*  He's actually a dog who often appears on our after show on locals. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=347.44s)]
*  I'm Glenn Greenwald here with my co-host Sylvester. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=352.52s)]
*  He was actually another dog who was found by David. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=354.84s)]
*  When David found him, he was already an adult so we don't actually know how old Sylvester [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=357.56s)]
*  is exactly. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=363.0s)]
*  David found him in 2011 so that means he's at least 13 years old, 14 years old, kind [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=364.24s)]
*  of in that realm and he's still incredibly healthy, incredibly active, lots of energy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't really even see a lot of signs of aging, not in terms of how he looks or in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=376.68s)]
*  terms of how he behaves. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  He's maybe slowed down a little bit but that's it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=382.56s)]
*  The way that it happened was there was a huge thunderstorm, I mean a really torrential downpour [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=385.44s)]
*  in Rio and at the time we lived up this hill near a forest and David was coming up the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  hill in this car and he saw a dog on the side of the road in this torrential downpour by [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=397.0s)]
*  himself. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=401.96s)]
*  So David stopped his car, got out in this rain and tried to walk over to Sylvester [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=402.96s)]
*  but he was so afraid of any person getting near him that he kept backing up and kept [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=409.2s)]
*  backing up. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=414.44s)]
*  Every time David would try and get near him, would get on his knees and call him over, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=415.64s)]
*  he would just keep backing up to the point that he was actually really close to a cliff [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=418.84s)]
*  and if he had backed up anymore he would have fallen down this cliff and died but it was [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=422.52s)]
*  a huge cliff. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=428.44s)]
*  And so David had to sit there and just kind of wait for him to come over and all he really [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=429.44s)]
*  did was kind of inch over because he was trying to get away from David and David was able [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=433.72s)]
*  to grab him and when David grabbed him he got aggressive, tried to bite David but you [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=437.52s)]
*  know if you rescue enough dogs you kind of know how to handle that situation, you know [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=442.8s)]
*  how to avoid getting bitten too much, you hold the dog in the back and all you want [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=445.92s)]
*  to do is get the dog in the car. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=449.68s)]
*  So he got Sylvester into the car and brought him home and we put him in this room downstairs [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=451.68s)]
*  that we had used for dogs that we were rescuing where of course you don't want to immediately [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  integrate the dog into this huge pack of other dogs, you don't know if they're sick and they [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=461.06s)]
*  can pass viruses or other diseases to other dogs that are contagious but also you have [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  no idea how this dog is going to react to suddenly being around a pack of 10 or 15 [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  dogs or even to humans. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  So we kept him in this room downstairs by himself, gave him a little bed, water, food [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=479.68s)]
*  obviously and I would say for at least two months every time we tried to enter that room [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=484.6s)]
*  he would back up into a corner and show extreme amounts of fear and then if you tried to get [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=490.04s)]
*  near him just stick your hand out even to let him smell your hand which is one of the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=496.18s)]
*  common ways that you try and get accustomed to a dog or accustomed to you he would start [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=500.12s)]
*  growling and if you got near him he would just snap and we got bitten multiple times [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=504.94s)]
*  by Sylvester but we knew it was fear, it wasn't aggression, it was fear and we knew it was [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=508.8s)]
*  just a question of time before he would start to trust us. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=516.0s)]
*  You sit in the room for an hour, sometimes I would work in the room just staying on the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=518.72s)]
*  floor, sitting on the floor so he got accustomed to my presence knowing that I wasn't a threat [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=522.56s)]
*  but usually it's a matter of a couple days or like a week at the most. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=528.08s)]
*  With Sylvester it was two solid months where he was so afraid, he obviously had been maltreated [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=532.08s)]
*  by humans or he would never have reacted that way, maybe a lot of different humans, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=537.72s)]
*  maybe the people who had been taking care of him, he was obviously domesticated but [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=542.24s)]
*  he had been on the street for a long time but he was still pretty, he wasn't quite as [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=549.04s)]
*  sick as most dogs that we rescue. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=552.76s)]
*  When Sylvester started getting comfortable with us he became an extremely affectionate [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=555.68s)]
*  dog and now I mean I wouldn't say he's the most affectionate dog, he's not the dog that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=559.64s)]
*  when you get there he's going to jump all over you and lick your face and wag his tail [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=565.3199999999999s)]
*  continuously but what he is is he's the most intensely loyal dog. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=569.04s)]
*  Like if I'm anywhere in public and anyone gets near me he stiffens up and he growls [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=574.92s)]
*  and he wants to protect me, there's just an intensity to everything that he does, he was [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  so intense at the beginning with this kind of aggression and now he's just like just [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  as intense but with love and devotion. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=589.36s)]
*  The way he'll look at me if I'm nearby or the kids, look he really loves my kids too, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=592.24s)]
*  it's the same intensity that he used to show us with fear and aggression and just like [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=598.44s)]
*  abuse transformed over time into the same kind of intensity but all positive attributes. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=603.84s)]
*  I think that dogs that you rescue in terrible situations they actually know that, I mean [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=609.96s)]
*  it's a very anthropomorphizing thought to say oh he knows that we rescued him from a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=614.64s)]
*  terrible situation so now he loves us. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=619.1800000000001s)]
*  I think it's just more instinctive, it's more kind of subliminal and so when you get a dog [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=620.72s)]
*  that you rescue in that kind of a situation the rewards are going to come back a hundredfold [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=625.44s)]
*  from what you give in the dog and also this is another dog that we rescued as an adult [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=630.12s)]
*  and we didn't have to go through like weird puppy phases or trying like have him destroy [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=636.24s)]
*  things or prevent him from destroying things or you know work him into adulthood. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=640.8s)]
*  He was an adult dog, oh my god he was pretty mature and now he's one of the most important [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=645.04s)]
*  dogs in my life. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=651.8s)]
*  So again adopting adult dogs which most people for some reason don't want to do even though [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=653.36s)]
*  a lot of people should do that is something that I think a lot of people consider. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  In fact for people, a lot of people who want to, to say they want to adopt a dog, everyone [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=662.64s)]
*  assumes they should get a puppy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=667.16s)]
*  I make a little argument a lot of times that they would be better served getting an older [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=668.48s)]
*  dog. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=671.96s)]
*  Sylvester is yet another example of a dog that we got when I already was an adult and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=672.96s)]
*  I can't put into words how gratifying it's been and how much we've gotten from him and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=677.92s)]
*  continue to get from him. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  Alright so that is the, a little bit of taste for this series that we want to produce. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=684.72s)]
*  I think we've already recorded maybe six or seven of them so we have the next six or seven [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=696.32s)]
*  weeks we obviously have a lot of work to do if we're going to do a dog every week although [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=700.96s)]
*  we certainly have no shortages of dogs. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=703.96s)]
*  I think one of the things that you'll find that I find so interesting is that each one [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  of their stories is so radically different. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=709.32s)]
*  Here is Sylvester, very distrustful, very, to the point of very fearful, took a lot of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=711.76s)]
*  time to kind of transform. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=718.8s)]
*  There are other dogs who just get there and they're just so happy and they integrate and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=720.16s)]
*  they're super social. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=724.4s)]
*  There's a lot of dogs in between. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=725.4s)]
*  A lot of ones have really terrible rescue stories where you find them, they're near [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=726.4s)]
*  death and you have to nurse them back to health and then you kind of can trace what they become [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=730.48s)]
*  as well. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=735.24s)]
*  And like I said, I think it's a way to think about not just the dog story themselves but [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=736.32s)]
*  the interaction between humans and dogs but humans and all animals and why that has become [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  increasingly important in a way I think relates to the first segment which is that we have [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=749.16s)]
*  so fewer connections, so less connectivity as humans and we need that because we're social [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=753.84s)]
*  and political animals that dogs have become increasingly important in the way we think [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=759.92s)]
*  about them. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=764.28s)]
*  I think that matters a great deal as well as just our relationship to animals in general. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=765.28s)]
*  So I hope that you will enjoy the series. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=770.16s)]
*  Like I said, it will just be about five to six minutes at the end of each week, so once [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=773.04s)]
*  a week at the very end on the last show. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=776.4s)]
*  That is the debut episode of System Pupdate and we hope that you enjoyed that as much [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGDc06PIxoY&t=778.72s)]
