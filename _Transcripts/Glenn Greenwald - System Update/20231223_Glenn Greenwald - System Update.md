# BREAKING: Rumble No Longer in Brazil Following Censorship Demands
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po)
*  All right, for our last story, which we weren't planning on doing because it only happened [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=0.0s)]
*  about an hour before we came on air, but for obvious reasons, it is something extremely [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=10.3s)]
*  relevant to the topics we cover since it involves both Rumble, the platform that our show appears [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=15.36s)]
*  on and that we devote a lot of attention to because of its free speech commitment, and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=21.32s)]
*  the country of Brazil where we've done a lot of reporting in part because I live here and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=26.44s)]
*  in part because we reported on it a lot and in part because it's become one of the leaders [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  of the global censorship regime. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=34.2s)]
*  And those all come together in this story. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=38.36s)]
*  We have constantly reported that the Brazilian Supreme Court is one of the most aggressive [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=41.7s)]
*  bodies anywhere in the democratic world for censoring political dissent. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  They often ignore the law in doing so. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=51.32s)]
*  They just frequently send out notices with no due process, no trial to every social [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=53.12s)]
*  media platform with a list of people that they say cannot be heard on those platforms. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=58.72s)]
*  And even though a lot of these powers were supposed to be unique to the 2022 election, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=64.56s)]
*  when we were told that the Brazilian Supreme Court needed better, more controls than ever [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=70.88s)]
*  over political speech to safeguard the integrity of the election, to protect it from disinformation, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=74.84s)]
*  in a lot of ways, even with that election done and over almost a full year ago, in fact [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=81.6s)]
*  over a full year ago, their censorship orders are continuing to escalate and Rumble is inundated [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  with constant demands and orders that they censor all sorts of Brazilians who have fled [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  to Rumble as the only place where they can be heard. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, Rumble doesn't want to be in the business of banning dissidents. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=103.84s)]
*  They in fact were created to do exactly the opposite. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  So a year and a half ago when the French government came to Rumble and said, you either remove [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=112.56s)]
*  Russian state media, RT and Sputnik or we will ban you in France, Rumble said we would [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=118.48s)]
*  rather not be available in France and sue you than obey your unjust censorship orders. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=124.64s)]
*  And if you go try and access Rumble in France, you get a note saying Rumble is not available [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=130.36s)]
*  in France. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=134.96s)]
*  Rumble now goes to the French court system trying to win the right to platform anybody [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  that they want and not to have to take orders from the French government. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=140.88s)]
*  That is something Rumble has done repeatedly when the British government tried to pressure [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=145.44s)]
*  and coerce Rumble to cut off Russell Brand because of anonymous media claims that he [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  engaged in sexual assault many years ago against various women, charges, by the way, that have [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  never turned into formal criminal charges. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=164.58s)]
*  They may at some point, but they haven't yet. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=167.66s)]
*  Rumble stuck their middle finger up at those British officials and said, you're not going [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=170.62s)]
*  to tell us who we can have on our platform. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=175.3s)]
*  We're not going to punish people who haven't been convicted of any crimes just based on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=177.46s)]
*  the say so of the media. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=182.3s)]
*  So they've really demonstrated their commitment over and over. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=184.12s)]
*  And now they've done the same thing in Brazil. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=188.26s)]
*  Here if you were in Brazil and you try and access Rumble as of today, this is the notice [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=190.5s)]
*  that you get very similar to the one in France. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=195.74s)]
*  Quote, note to users in Brazil, because the Brazilian government demands to remove creators [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=197.7s)]
*  from our platform, Rumble is currently unavailable in Brazil. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=203.14s)]
*  We are challenging these government demands and hope to restore access soon. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=207.06s)]
*  Now what really is needed at some point is for a major big tech platform like Twitter [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=213.82s)]
*  under Elon Musk, which says it's devoted to the cause of free speech, or YouTube or Facebook [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  to unite and say to a country, whatever country, as a signal to the rest, if you're going to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=230.94s)]
*  try and control what political speech we can and can't permit, we're just not going to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=238.06s)]
*  be available in your country and you can deal with your citizens and their rage and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=242.3s)]
*  anger over the fact that they now can't use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Rumble. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  So far they're unwilling to do that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=252.9s)]
*  Rumble is the one that, even though they're the smallest of those, seems to be willing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=254.38000000000002s)]
*  to bear the brunt of this crusade. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=258.92s)]
*  But what this really shows is that even though we are really inculcated in the West to believe [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=263.42s)]
*  that we are free, that we live in the democratic world, we call ourselves the democratic world, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=269.66s)]
*  this censorship regime has advanced to a point that you can almost not overstate. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=275.14s)]
*  The amount of control that Western governments have seized, and I include Brazil and that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=281.38s)]
*  as part of the democratic world, and systematized is beyond what four years ago anybody would [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=286.78s)]
*  have ever imagined. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=295.06s)]
*  The first test case for this was Alex Jones and Myla Yiannopoulos, when Facebook and Google [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=296.72s)]
*  and Twitter got together and banned those two, expecting that most people wouldn't care [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=302.88000000000005s)]
*  because of who it was and everybody cheered and now this system is with us and it predictably [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=308.26000000000005s)]
*  expanded not just in the United States but in multiple countries all over the world. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=315.14000000000004s)]
*  And one of the reasons we're so proud to be on Rumble, one of the reasons we hope you [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=319.92s)]
*  will support Rumble, both through supporting our show but also supporting the Rumble platform [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=322.7s)]
*  itself is because they are genuinely committed even at times when they have to sacrifice [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=327.86s)]
*  their own economic self-interest to combat this censorship regime. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=332.53999999999996s)]
*  It is not just part of their business plan, it is part of their DNA, of their moral crusade. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  And there are lots of ways to support Rumble, watching shows obviously when you can watch [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  them on Rumble instead of somewhere else, patronizing advertisers, supporting the shows [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=348.14s)]
*  through independent journalism, through subscriptions and memberships and the like, but this is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  a very important case for a lot of Brazilian dissidents who use Rumble and obviously the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=359.58s)]
*  Brazilian people are now going to see that there's yet another service saying to Brazil [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=366.06s)]
*  we refuse to enter your market because you just don't afford basic freedoms. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=370.06s)]
*  We need more of this, we need more of these kinds of crusades. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=374.62s)]
*  I can guarantee you, guarantee you that as the 24 election approaches in the United States [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=378.3s)]
*  and as more and more elections approach in the EU, this is going to severely escalate. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=385.6s)]
*  And the few places left on the internet that are devoted to free speech are the ones whose [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=393.1s)]
*  importance can really not be overstated. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=398.14s)]
*  Thanks for watching this clip from System Update, our live show that airs every Monday [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwB78D8N8Po&t=405.62s)]
