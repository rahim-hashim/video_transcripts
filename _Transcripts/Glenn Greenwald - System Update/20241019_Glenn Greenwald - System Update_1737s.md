# Repressive Terrorism Act Weaponized Against Israel's Critics
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I)
*  One of the topics on which we have most focused over the last year or so is the rising authoritarianism [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=0.0s)]
*  in all Western countries, including the United States, in the name of protecting and defending [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=12.56s)]
*  the state of Israel from criticism, from journalism, from activism that might in some way reflect [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=17.8s)]
*  poorly on Israel or undermine their political interests. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=23.0s)]
*  One of the sites that does that most effectively is the electronic Intifada and that outlet [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=26.3s)]
*  has a reporter, Aza Winstron Lee, who frequently reports in a very effective way, a very critical [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=32.7s)]
*  way on Israel, its war in Gaza and the war in Lebanon. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=38.94s)]
*  And recently, this last week in fact, this week, earlier this week, he had British police [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=41.94s)]
*  show up at his door, pound on the door, and then come in and seize all of his electronic [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=48.7s)]
*  equipment telling him that they were investigating whether or not he was in violation of something [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=53.66s)]
*  called the Terrorism Act of 2000. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=57.26s)]
*  And there's been other types of censorship, other attempts to criminalize journalism and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=59.46s)]
*  activism and reporting that's aimed at criticizing Israel throughout the West. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=65.1s)]
*  And the founder and the director of the electronic Intifada, who is Ali Abdomnima, who is a good [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=69.9s)]
*  friend of mine and a friend of the show that I've known for a long time, is with us tonight [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  to talk about all of that as well as everything else happening with the latest wars from Israel [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=79.5s)]
*  in the U.S. role. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=85.42s)]
*  And Ali, it's great to see you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=86.42s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to come on tonight. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=87.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=90.7s)]
*  Thank you, Glenn. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=91.7s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=92.7s)]
*  So let's talk about Aza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=93.7s)]
*  First of all, the reporter who works at the electronic Intifada for a long time is a very [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=94.7s)]
*  well-respected, longtime British journalist whose journalistic methods are very common, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=100.94s)]
*  very solid and reliable. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=106.14s)]
*  I've cited his work a long time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=107.9s)]
*  For those who aren't familiar with him, just tell us a little bit about his background [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=109.9s)]
*  and then what specifically happened earlier this week with the British police. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=113.86s)]
*  Yeah, Aza Winstanley is a fantastic investigative journalist. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  He's one of the most important investigative journalists working today. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=123.14s)]
*  And so we're very proud that he's our colleague at the electronic Intifada. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=127.34s)]
*  Among his many important pieces of journalism is his book, Weaponizing Antisemitism, How [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=133.22s)]
*  the Israel Lobby Helped to Bring Down Jeremy Corbyn, which documents how the Israel lobby [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=141.22s)]
*  and the British deep state, for want of a better word, colluded to fabricate an antisemitism [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=148.26s)]
*  in order to smear Jeremy Corbyn, an independent minded, moderately left-wing leader who rose [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=157.42s)]
*  to become by popular acclaim, huge landslide popular votes, the leader of the main opposition [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  as it was at the time, Labour Party. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=176.7s)]
*  And Corbyn was also, of course, a lifelong campaigner for Palestinian rights. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=179.42s)]
*  So that's one of Aza's great achievements, is completely busting this fraud and hoax [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=184.66s)]
*  of a crisis of antisemitism in the Labour Party. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=192.74s)]
*  His most recent article for the electronic Intifada, published on October 7th this year, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=197.18s)]
*  the anniversary of the Palestinian resistance operation and the beginning of the Israeli [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=203.46s)]
*  genocide, is at the electronic Intifada and it's headlined how Israel killed hundreds [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=208.46s)]
*  of its own people on 7 October. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=214.16s)]
*  And it shows, with meticulous documentation based on our reporting for a year, and this [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=218.32s)]
*  is all based on Israeli sources, how Israel applied the so-called Hannibal doctrine on [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=224.76s)]
*  October 7th, which is a military directive that allows Israeli forces to kill their own [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=233.2s)]
*  people, soldiers and civilians, in order to prevent them being taken captive. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=239.8s)]
*  And that was responsible for hundreds of the deaths on October 7th, a fact not really contested [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=246.4s)]
*  in Israel, but which is totally absent from Western narratives and mainstream media. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  So that's the type of journalism that Aza does. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=259.08000000000004s)]
*  So and by the way, I mean, we've covered that here as well. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=262.88s)]
*  Last week, Barack Obama said, today we commemorate the 1,400 people who were killed by Hamas [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=267.36s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=275.56s)]
*  Abigail Shrier, who works at Barry Weiss, the Free Press, said one year ago 1,400 Israeli [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=277.44s)]
*  civilians were killed by Hamas. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=282.44s)]
*  And of course, the death toll was reduced and reduced. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=285.92s)]
*  It's now about 1,100 people, 350 of whom were active duty IDF soldiers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  So at most, there's about 650, 700 actual civilians who were killed that day. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  And as you say, a non-trivial portion of them were actually killed by the IDF in applying [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=302.24s)]
*  this doctrine that says it's better to kill our own citizens and permit them to be kidnapped. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=308.48s)]
*  And there's almost nobody in the United States who even knows this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=313.56s)]
*  Now I wanted to talk about what happened specifically at Aza's house, what the police did and what [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=317.12s)]
*  they said in response to perhaps that reporting that you just mentioned or the body of work [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=325.04s)]
*  that he's been doing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=329.56s)]
*  Can you walk us through that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=330.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=332.88s)]
*  So this happened on Thursday, October 17th. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=334.12s)]
*  Aza got a knock on his door just before 6 a.m. London time. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  He lives in London. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=344.48s)]
*  And there were 10 officers from the Counterterrorism Division of the Metropolitan Police. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=346.48s)]
*  That's the main police force in the UK. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=353.76s)]
*  And they served him with two search warrants, one for his house and one for his vehicle [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=356.76s)]
*  to seize all electronic devices connected with his journalism and any notes or documents [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=363.44s)]
*  connected with his journalism that they wanted to take. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=371.08s)]
*  And that's exactly what they did. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  And they told him that this investigation has been going on for a year and that it was [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=377.48s)]
*  connected with his social media posts. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=385.28s)]
*  Now that raises an immediate question, if it's about his social media posts, which we [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=389.04s)]
*  can talk about how absurd it is that it's a criminal offense to say things online in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=394.44s)]
*  the UK, to hold certain opinions and to express them online. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=399.64s)]
*  Well, if it's about his social media posts, why does he need to seize? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  Why do they need to seize all his electronic devices when they can just read his Twitter [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=408.20000000000005s)]
*  feed? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=412.8s)]
*  But they did seize all his electronic devices, including the devices he uses for his journalism [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=413.8s)]
*  and that may well contain information about sources and other privileged material that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=419.48s)]
*  would be typically in the possession of a journalist. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  And they now have all of that equipment. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=434.08s)]
*  They have seized it after raiding his home under these search warrants. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=438.64s)]
*  We've seen a lot of examples in the UK in particular, but other countries as well, where [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  police show up at people's homes to interrogate them about social media posts. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=449.11999999999995s)]
*  They've expressed about a whole wide range of issues, but it's intensified a great deal [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=453.88s)]
*  over the last year, specifically by targeting critics of Israel. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=457.84s)]
*  What really caught my attention about this story was the use of the Terrorism Act of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=462.88s)]
*  2000 to say that that was a potential law that he may have violated. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=465.88s)]
*  And as you, I think, recall, I have a lot of personal experience with that because during [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=470.56s)]
*  the Snowden reporting, when my husband was working on this reporting with me and came [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=473.56s)]
*  back home through Heathrow, he was detained under that Terrorism Act of 2000 for 11 hours, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=477.24s)]
*  was constantly threatened with prosecution for terrorism. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  And we were all very confounded about how a terrorism charge could be invoked or even [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  investigation when he was working on the Snowden reporting, which multiple media outlets were [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=492.76s)]
*  around the world and ultimately won the Pulitzer Prize for public service. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=496.76s)]
*  And we sued and although the court said that they had the right to detain him under British [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  law, British law was in conflict with the EU law because the Terrorism Act can't be [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=505.23999999999995s)]
*  used for journalists. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=509.32s)]
*  Now, I think that's a different provision because that was for airport detention than [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=510.32s)]
*  probably they use for a system. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=515.3s)]
*  Let me just say what, if I'm understanding correctly, what they're essentially saying, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=517.26s)]
*  and actually Ron DeSantis used this rationale in order to order all student groups for justice [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=521.46s)]
*  in Palestine shut down and through the University of Florida system, was that if you start criticizing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=527.58s)]
*  Israel, reporting on Israel in a way that crosses some imaginary line in the head of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=532.5s)]
*  government officials, you cross the line and you actually start quote unquote encouraging [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=537.54s)]
*  them, even though you're only speaking and expressing your views. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=542.7s)]
*  And then that becomes a crime. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=545.86s)]
*  You're saying you're criticizing Israel so much that you're basically helping Hamas or [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=547.74s)]
*  Hezbollah through what it is that you're saying. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=551.5400000000001s)]
*  It's basically a way that the government can just sort of secretly on their own decide [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=554.0200000000001s)]
*  that a particular view can be criminalized as terrorism. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=557.72s)]
*  Is this what it seems like they're doing in this case? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=561.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just to clarify something, the UK has multiple terrorism acts. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=565.6600000000001s)]
*  There is the Terrorism Act of 2000 and there is the Terrorism Act of 2006. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=571.86s)]
*  And in the documents that the police served on ESA when they raided his home, they cite [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=578.06s)]
*  the Terrorism Act of 2006, not the Terrorism Act of 2000. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=584.5799999999999s)]
*  Right, and David was detained under the 2001. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=589.4599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=592.66s)]
*  And they both do contain some similar provisions. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=594.14s)]
*  But in the specific case of ESA, they are citing provisions of the Terrorism Act of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=598.5s)]
*  2006. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=605.5s)]
*  And this is, they actually gave him a copy of this part of the Terrorism Act of 2006, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=607.98s)]
*  sections one and two, which purport to criminalize something called encouragement of terrorism. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=616.06s)]
*  And if you look at what legal authorities and human rights groups that focus on this [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=625.0200000000001s)]
*  say, they say that this provision of encouragement of terrorism is extremely broad and basically [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=632.82s)]
*  criminalizes any kind of speech the government doesn't like. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=638.6600000000001s)]
*  Human Rights Watch has actually called for this provision of the Terrorism Act 2006 to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=642.98s)]
*  be repealed because it basically infringes on any notion or any obligation to uphold [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=648.82s)]
*  free speech. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=654.98s)]
*  And the way the British authorities have been using these kinds of provisions, including [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=655.98s)]
*  the Terrorism Act 2000 and the 2006 Act, is to outlaw things like saying that you support [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=662.74s)]
*  the right of Palestinians to resist Israeli military occupation using armed struggle, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=671.2600000000001s)]
*  which by the way is a right enshrined in international law. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=677.86s)]
*  But if you say that... [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=680.38s)]
*  Which is exactly what you said earlier just a little bit ago. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=681.38s)]
*  And it seems like in the UK, if you said that, that could easily be criminalized. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=684.3399999999999s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=689.38s)]
*  And people have been criminalized for the signs they've held at rallies protesting the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  genocide in Gaza. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=696.18s)]
*  They are being criminalized and prosecuted for things they say online, exactly as appears [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=697.9399999999999s)]
*  to be the case, or at least the investigation. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=703.66s)]
*  I should clarify, he was not arrested and was not detained. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=706.54s)]
*  His house was searched and his devices were seized. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=712.6999999999999s)]
*  But of course, he could be arrested at any time. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=718.3399999999999s)]
*  And this has happened because just in the past couple of months, in August, the freelance [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  journalist Richard Medhurst, who is British, was returning to the UK and was detained at [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=728.9s)]
*  Heathrow Airport and arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=735.54s)]
*  Yeah, we had him on our show to talk about that. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=740.2199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=741.98s)]
*  So you know about that case. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=742.98s)]
*  And then just less than two weeks later, a well-known activist with a large social media [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=745.2199999999999s)]
*  following Sarah Wilkinson also had her home raided and similar kind of, you know, just [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=752.0999999999999s)]
*  abusive process. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=760.26s)]
*  Again, for social media posts that had to do with Gaza and Palestine and critical of [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=763.1s)]
*  Israel. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=768.94s)]
*  And then back in December, ironically, Asa wrote about this for the Electronic Intifada. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=769.94s)]
*  There are two prominent activists in the UK, Tony Greenstein and Mike Napier, who were [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=775.1s)]
*  arrested and charged with offenses for stating at rallies, at demonstrations that they support [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=780.62s)]
*  the right of Palestinians to resist. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=788.1400000000001s)]
*  In the case of Tony Greenstein, who is an author, he's written a book recently, and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=790.26s)]
*  he's also contributed articles to the Electronic Intifada. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=795.9s)]
*  His bail conditions included being prohibited from posting on Twitter about the conflict [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=799.26s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=805.74s)]
*  So that's just a taste. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=806.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=808.66s)]
*  Well, it's shocking. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=809.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=810.66s)]
*  But also what enrages me the most about all of this is not that these states are doing [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=811.66s)]
*  it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=817.0600000000001s)]
*  It didn't surprise me. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=819.02s)]
*  What enrages me is that there is an entire portion of the political right in the United [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=820.38s)]
*  States and throughout Western Europe that has been waving the free speech banner for [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=824.9s)]
*  the last 10 years, claiming, I think often validly, that they are the victim of state [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=829.7399999999999s)]
*  big tech censorship, who suddenly, because they disagree so vehemently with any of the [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=834.06s)]
*  things you just got done saying, either are silent about it and don't want to mention [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=838.54s)]
*  it or actively cheer what is happening to you because they finally now confront a view [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=844.16s)]
*  that is being targeted that they dislike with censorship and they just are incapable of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=850.0s)]
*  applying these principles. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=854.84s)]
*  Like every principle gets waived soon as the topic is Israel. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=855.84s)]
*  Well, you're completely right about that, Glenn, but it's not just the political right. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=859.76s)]
*  It's also the sort of mainstream liberals because to date, there hasn't been a single [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=865.88s)]
*  report in mainstream media about the raid on AESA, which should be shocking to anyone. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=872.68s)]
*  I mean, the liberal principles are supposedly we can disagree, but we should defend one [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=880.12s)]
*  another's right to hold differing opinions. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=886.7199999999999s)]
*  They don't do that. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=889.52s)]
*  We haven't seen any coverage from The Guardian or the BBC. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=890.64s)]
*  Not a single mainstream journalist has come out. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=894.8s)]
*  Not even in the UK. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=897.92s)]
*  Not even in the UK. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=900.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about the UK. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=901.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm talking about the UK. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=903.92s)]
*  And so it's just totally absent. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=906.6s)]
*  And this is the UK. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=909.4s)]
*  But Glenn, I don't know if you also knew that Germany a couple of months ago threatened [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=911.52s)]
*  me with prison and fines for making a speech via Zoom to an audience in Germany. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=918.56s)]
*  So it's not just the UK. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=924.6s)]
*  It's across it's across the Western world. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=926.24s)]
*  Totally. And it's worse in Germany. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=929.68s)]
*  But it's happening in every country, including the United States. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=931.7199999999999s)]
*  And just to clarify, when I said the political right, what I really meant is the kind of [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=934.04s)]
*  pro-Israel, pro-Zionist part of the right that has just been incredibly hypocritical. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=937.64s)]
*  There's been a couple of exceptions of people speaking out against some of the more [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=942.1999999999999s)]
*  egregious attempts to impose censorship by law against Israel's critics. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=945.04s)]
*  But for the most part, you know, these people have been waving that flag and have no [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=948.92s)]
*  belief in the actual principle of it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=954.68s)]
*  All right. Why would I have you? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=956.16s)]
*  Let me ask you about the killing of the Hamas leader, Yehoshin Warp, because there's a [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=958.92s)]
*  lot of suggestions, I think delusionally, that somehow Netanyahu can now as an [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=966.0s)]
*  opportunity to end the war as if he wants to. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=970.92s)]
*  I remember just to set the stage for this back in 2001, shortly after the 9-11 attack, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=974.24s)]
*  Bill Maher had a show on ABC News and people were calling the 9-11 hijackers [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=979.92s)]
*  cowards for what they did. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=985.5999999999999s)]
*  And he said, look, you can find what they did reprehensible and despicable. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  But the one thing you can't say about them is that they're cowards. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=993.0799999999999s)]
*  They gave up their own life for a cause by hijacking planes, flying them into the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=995.5999999999999s)]
*  building knowing they were going to die. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=999.12s)]
*  Like, whatever else that is, it's not cowardly. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1000.52s)]
*  He got fired for that because no one wanted to hear that, even though it was so blatantly [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1002.64s)]
*  true. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1006.52s)]
*  The IDF released this footage of what they said was Sinwar's last moment, and it was [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1007.3199999999999s)]
*  shocking that they did because it showed him in military fatigues on the front line [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1012.68s)]
*  fighting wars, not hiding in some tunnel as they would try to claim. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  And even once he had his arm blown off and was bleeding profusely, he still basically, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1022.56s)]
*  the last thing he did was throw a wooden stick at an Israeli drone that was trying to [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1029.32s)]
*  track him because they were too afraid to enter the house and confront him directly, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  which seems to me like it's going to have a big impact in that region, not just his [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  assassination, but the way in which he died confronting the Israeli military, even [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1044.6s)]
*  though he had very primitive weapons and they have the most sophisticated ones given by [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1049.72s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1052.72s)]
*  What do you think the impact of this will be first on the Israeli Gaza conflict, but [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1053.4399999999998s)]
*  then in the broader region? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1056.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know, there have been these coordinated tweets from the, you know, what should [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1058.04s)]
*  we call them, from the Five Eyes, from, you know, Justin Trudeau, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  Keir Starmer, and others, you know, just celebrating the killing of Yahya Sinwar and [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1072.08s)]
*  demonizing him as this terrible terrorist leader and the world is better off without [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1079.44s)]
*  him. And, you know, they've just been completely ratioed on Twitter. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1084.52s)]
*  Nobody is buying that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1088.44s)]
*  And I think that highlights just the galaxy size disconnect between how Palestinians, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  Arabs, Muslims and people across much of the world perceive someone like Yahya Sinwar [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1097.64s)]
*  as opposed to how he's portrayed in the West or in Israel. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1105.52s)]
*  He is seen as a resistance hero, as someone who gave his life fighting with his people, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1109.12s)]
*  himself wearing a vest, carrying a gun for the liberation of his people from a Western [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1116.84s)]
*  backed, a U.S. armed regime that is perpetrating genocide. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1124.36s)]
*  He could not be seen as more legitimate by Palestinians and by the vast, you know, by [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1128.84s)]
*  hundreds or billions of people across the world. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1136.04s)]
*  And we're seeing that he already had this incredibly high reputation, which has just [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1139.04s)]
*  been, you know, sent into the stratosphere by the way he died, courageously fighting [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1145.64s)]
*  with his people, for his people, leading from the front. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1152.72s)]
*  And that's the reality of who Yahya Sinwar was. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1156.8400000000001s)]
*  And the efforts to, you know, we talked about the lies and omissions about October 7th. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1161.0s)]
*  Of course, the other big one is that on October 7th, Palestinians burned babies and [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1167.28s)]
*  beheaded people and carried out mass rapes, none of which is true. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1173.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's part of the reporting that I've done and the electronic into fathers done [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1177.1599999999999s)]
*  and Asa and Stanley has done showing how this is all complete atrocity propaganda and lies [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1182.24s)]
*  that they are trying to turn into reality just by by repetition. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1188.36s)]
*  So the other thing, I mean, if you cast your mind back, Glenn, to mere weeks ago when [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1194.2399999999998s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, who has arguably even greater status among [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1201.32s)]
*  the people of the region and the world, was killed, there was all this triumphalism and [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1208.52s)]
*  euphoria in the United States and in Israel and the West. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1213.28s)]
*  Now, Lebanon is ours. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1217.6399999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah will crumble. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1219.3999999999999s)]
*  We're going to remake the region in our image. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1220.96s)]
*  And of course, Hezbollah came out fighting and the Israelis haven't been able to advance [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1223.32s)]
*  even a few hundred meters into Lebanon, let alone have Israelis go back to the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1228.96s)]
*  settlements in the north that this operation in Lebanon was supposed to enable them to [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1236.12s)]
*  do. And it will be exactly the same with with Hamas. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1240.84s)]
*  Israel has assassinated Palestinian leaders and the Zionist movement have assassinated [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1244.9599999999998s)]
*  Palestinian other leaders since the 1930s. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1250.9599999999998s)]
*  And they have assassinated almost every leader of Hamas, like leaders of Hamas don't die [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1254.76s)]
*  natural deaths. And they assassinated the two leaders of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1260.9199999999998s)]
*  He became the leader of Hezbollah in 1992 after Israel assassinated his predecessor. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1268.0s)]
*  These assassinations have historically only made these movements stronger and more [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1275.6399999999999s)]
*  determined. And that's what will happen here. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1282.72s)]
*  So it's utterly delusional to think that Hamas is just going to collapse and go away. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1286.08s)]
*  But there is this sort of very shallow orientalist thinking that the people of the region [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1290.76s)]
*  are simply mules and sheep who follow behind these strongmen and not people dedicated [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1296.4s)]
*  deeply to a cause, the cause of their liberation from US-backed imperialism and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1304.4s)]
*  colonialism. All right. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1310.28s)]
*  So speaking of the role of the US and this will be our last question just for time [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1311.68s)]
*  considerations. One of the things that has amazed me and there's things that I hate that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1315.92s)]
*  don't surprise me and things that I hate to do. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1321.24s)]
*  And we've sort of been drawing this dichotomy a few times when I'm talking to you. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1323.1599999999999s)]
*  But there's been a whole sort of horde of left liberal commentators over the last year [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1326.4799999999998s)]
*  who have made a lot of money, generated a lot of traffic, drawn a lot of attention to [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1333.9599999999998s)]
*  themselves and fortified their brands as sort of critics of the Democratic Party by [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1337.8799999999999s)]
*  constantly calling what's being done in Gaza a genocide, by claiming that Joe Biden and [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1343.8799999999999s)]
*  Al-Kamala Harris are complicit in the genocide. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1348.6799999999998s)]
*  And they've been doing this, strutting around doing all this for 10 months. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1350.96s)]
*  And then as the election approaches and then immediately once Kamala Harris is installed, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1354.4s)]
*  they suddenly forget about all that. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1359.16s)]
*  And they basically announced that from now on, they're going to pledge to do everything [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1361.28s)]
*  to keep empowered the very people who for the last 10 months to their own benefit, they [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1364.76s)]
*  were accusing of being complicit in a genocide. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1369.4s)]
*  Now, I get the idea that elections sometimes you have to pick the lesser of two evils, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1371.92s)]
*  but a genocide isn't the line for you where somebody commits genocide, then it's just [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1376.2s)]
*  so hard to conceive of how anybody has anything other than a rotted soul who's willing to [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1381.92s)]
*  do that. How do you see the role of the United States government, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1385.72s)]
*  and everything that we've been talking about? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1391.36s)]
*  To me personally, I speak for myself. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1395.2s)]
*  You know, the electronic intervallar doesn't, you know, endorse candidates or take positions [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1398.12s)]
*  on elections. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1403.52s)]
*  I'm speaking for myself. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1404.7199999999998s)]
*  You know, for me, if genocide, if a Holocaust, which is what the United States and Israel [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1406.8s)]
*  are perpetrating, Holocaust means burning or burnt offering. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1412.4399999999998s)]
*  And we just saw, you know, people being burned alive at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Dar al-Balah [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1417.12s)]
*  on top of all the whole year of atrocities. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1425.6399999999999s)]
*  If that's not a line for you, nothing is. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  If you say, yes, genocide, but what about this or what about there is no but with genocide? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1430.32s)]
*  That's like saying, yeah, Hitler murdered millions of Jews, but he made the trains run [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1435.96s)]
*  on time. I mean, it's to me morally reprehensible. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1441.32s)]
*  And, you know, I have no fondness. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1445.8799999999999s)]
*  I would say I have nothing but contempt for Donald Trump. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1450.0s)]
*  And he did terrible things in office, including, you know, continuing the wars in the region [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1453.48s)]
*  that that that have caused and continue to cause so much devastation. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1461.56s)]
*  But they try to fear monger that, oh, well, Donald Trump will do all these terrible things [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1467.68s)]
*  to you and he will be even worse to the Palestinians. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1474.36s)]
*  The simple fact is that, you know, you have to be unwilling to face facts, if you can't say [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1477.96s)]
*  that there is nothing Donald Trump did in his four years in office that is even remotely as [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1488.04s)]
*  horrifying and criminal and murderous as this genocide that is fully supported by Joe Biden and [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1494.1200000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris, or is as murderous and horrific as the illegal aggression and invasion of Iraq, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1501.8s)]
*  which killed and displaced and destroyed the lives of millions of people, which was done by Dick [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1510.76s)]
*  Cheney, who is now on Team Joe Biden and Team Kamala Harris. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1516.6s)]
*  If you can't see that, you have just no integrity whatsoever. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1521.24s)]
*  And I believe that in a democracy, you know, we should have better choices than we have. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1525.48s)]
*  We have absolutely reprehensible and terrible choices. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1531.88s)]
*  There are third parties. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1536.6000000000001s)]
*  You've had Jill Stein on your show, and I thought that was an excellent interview. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1537.88s)]
*  But we we have very few viable choices because the system is so rigged. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1542.8400000000001s)]
*  But at a certain point, you have to say, I will not participate. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1548.2800000000002s)]
*  I will not reward those committing a Holocaust. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1552.12s)]
*  And I'm willing to pay the price because the well-being and comfort of American Americans [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1555.32s)]
*  in general, but particularly the American liberals who browbeat us that we have to vote for the [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1562.84s)]
*  people who are burning us alive, burning our friends and family alive. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1567.8s)]
*  That comfort is not more important to me than the lives of the people in Gaza being burned to death [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1572.76s)]
*  by the bombs and missiles that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are airlifting around the clock to Israel. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1579.72s)]
*  Yeah. And that was they will continue to if Kamala Harris wins the election. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1586.28s)]
*  She's been very clear about that. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1589.72s)]
*  And just just to sort of add to what you said about the Trump administration, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1591.64s)]
*  the two wars that Trump inherited, the one that Obama started of aiding Saudi Arabia [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1597.4s)]
*  and its bombing of the Houthis in Yemen, creating a massive catastrophe of humanitarian proportions. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1602.76s)]
*  And then also the bombing campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1608.92s)]
*  Everything that Trump did in that regard, as well as the things he most did to help Israel, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1613.64s)]
*  like moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, those were the things that the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1618.52s)]
*  Democrats fully supported. There were very few people criticizing him for that. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1622.1200000000001s)]
*  The only time the media ever really praised Donald Trump was when he shot missiles at Syria. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1626.04s)]
*  Yeah. And bombed Syria. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1632.68s)]
*  And so even to the extent that you want to point to these things that Trump did, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1635.0s)]
*  there's no opposition in the Democratic Party to them. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1639.3999999999999s)]
*  The wing of the Democratic Party, especially represented by Kamala Harris, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1641.8s)]
*  is going to serve those same foreign policy interests. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1645.72s)]
*  And when I look at it, I see that Donald Trump was the first president in decades [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1648.92s)]
*  not to involve the U.S. in a new war. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1653.6399999999999s)]
*  He certainly continued the two wars and even escalated them that he inherited from Obama. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1655.56s)]
*  Whereas you see under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, these constant involvements of the U.S., [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1660.04s)]
*  including in this horrific massacre in Gaza. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1665.8799999999999s)]
*  So I'm not making the case for Donald Trump in that regard. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1668.84s)]
*  I'm just saying that even to the extent that you want to look at what Trump did [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1670.68s)]
*  and things you don't like, there's no opposition from the Democratic Party. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1673.96s)]
*  All right, Ali, I really appreciate your coming on. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1677.72s)]
*  I could have a lot more things, but I want to be respectful of your time and our audience's time. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1681.3999999999999s)]
*  So we'd love to have you back on to talk about the war itself, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1685.48s)]
*  how it's evolving both in Gaza and Lebanon. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1688.44s)]
*  Probably there's going to be some retaliation with Iran at some point. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1691.48s)]
*  So there'll be a lot to talk about just in terms of the substance. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1695.4s)]
*  But this authoritarian attempt to target and criminalize journalists [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1697.72s)]
*  who are critical of Israel is incredibly disturbing. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1701.72s)]
*  So I appreciate your coming on and talking about that. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1703.56s)]
*  Thank you. I'd love to come back on, too. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0pZzrmT8I&t=1706.92s)]
