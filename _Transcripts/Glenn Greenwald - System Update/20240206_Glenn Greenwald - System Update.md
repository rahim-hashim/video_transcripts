# Deranged: Tucker Branded “Traitor” Over Moscow Visit
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg)
*  Tucker Carlson over the weekend was spotted by a member of the Russian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=0.0s)]
*  public or somebody in Russia attending the Bolshoi Ballet which is located in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=12.52s)]
*  Moscow. Now the Bolshoi Ballet, you may have thought from hearing the commentary [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  that ensued, is not actually a gulag where some of the worst human rights [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=22.12s)]
*  abuses take place but instead is one of the high cultural points of planet Earth, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=28.44s)]
*  of the human species. The Bolshoi Ballet is the pinnacle of the art form of ballet [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=34.68s)]
*  and Moscow for anyone who has visited is filled with all kinds of amazing and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=40.96s)]
*  inspiring architecture and high culture and a very rich history from a country [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=47.92s)]
*  that has been around for many many centuries with a very storied history. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=52.32s)]
*  It's a country that Americans have always visited. It's a country where [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  American journalists have always gone to interview Russian leaders including at [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=61.36s)]
*  the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union was the United States's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=66.92s)]
*  number one enemy and yet Tucker Carlson's visit to Russia, his appearance [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=70.08s)]
*  physically in Moscow, as well as the rumor that he has gone there with the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=74.96s)]
*  intention of interviewing Vladimir Putin, something that every journalist worth [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  that title would be eager to do to interview any world leader is one of the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=86.2s)]
*  high points of a journalist career. It's always a vital public service especially [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=90.44s)]
*  when Washington is now trying to convince Americans to send another 60 [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=97.92s)]
*  billion dollars to a country that Russia is at war with in order to basically [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=102.38s)]
*  fight a proxy war against that country. We should of course want to hear from [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=109.04s)]
*  Russian leaders and should want to hear questions that come from an American [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=113.72s)]
*  perspective which if Tucker is going to do that interview is certainly something [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=117.64s)]
*  you would expect him to ask about. The idea that we wouldn't want to hear that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=122.08s)]
*  that we would somehow be harmed if we hear an interview from a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=127.52s)]
*  lifelong American journalist who has worked at basically every media outlet in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=133.36s)]
*  the United States of a leader of a country that's one of the largest and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=136.2s)]
*  most influential in the world is madness. And yet not only are we being told that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=141.32s)]
*  this event is threatening to the United States and to Americans and that it's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=147.4s)]
*  somehow a sinister act, many prominent liberal and neocon elites and that's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=150.72s)]
*  basically a repetitive phrase at this point. The overlap between [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=158.4s)]
*  neoconservatives and liberals is almost full and complete. Basically neocons are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=163.68s)]
*  the thought leaders of the Democratic Party when it comes to foreign policy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=170.24s)]
*  and what they are pronouncing is that Tucker Carlson is guilty of the crime of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  treason. Even though the United States is not actually at war with Russia, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  there's no congressional authorization to use military force against Russia, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  there's no declaration of war against Russia, which is the bare minimum needed [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=187.4s)]
*  to be guilty of quote aiding and abetting an enemy of the United States [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  which is the constitutional definition of the crime of treason. They're using [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=196.72s)]
*  this term treason and traitor earnestly, literally. Some are even arguing, I'm [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=200.68s)]
*  talking about recognizable names in American politics that Tucker Carlson [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=207.48s)]
*  should be banned from reentering the country even though he's an American [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=210.76s)]
*  citizen and has the obvious constitutional right to reenter the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=214.0s)]
*  country and there's even been some viral tweets suggesting that he ought to be [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  murdered by Ukrainian forces while in Moscow. Now that shouldn't surprise [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=223.3s)]
*  anybody who's been paying attention to the mentality of Ukraine supporters and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=228.46s)]
*  the militias that dominate Ukraine. This story made it to The Guardian, the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=233.46s)]
*  British newspaper earlier today and they're taking quite seriously this idea [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  that something sinister has occurred. It's kind of ironic, I actually went to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=247.22s)]
*  Moscow when I worked at The Guardian as a reporter to interview Edward Snowden. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=253.02s)]
*  They've sent their own reporters to interview Vladimir Putin and to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=258.02s)]
*  interview Edward Snowden and others in Russia. It's what journalists do and yet [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=262.1s)]
*  now they seem to be suggesting that anyone who goes to Russia as a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=268.22s)]
*  journalist either to visit the Bolshoi Ballet or to see the sights of Moscow or [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=270.98s)]
*  even to potentially interview the Russian president is somehow engaged in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=275.98s)]
*  malevolent acts. Here's the headline from The Guardian, quote, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  Kremlin quiet as Tucker Carlson's Russia visit creates Putin interview rumors. The [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=285.18s)]
*  far-right broadcasters spotted at the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow having [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=291.82s)]
*  reportedly arrived last week. Quote, the Kremlin has declined to say whether [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=296.58s)]
*  Vladimir Putin would grant an interview to Tucker Carlson, the far-right [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=302.06s)]
*  American journalist. After the former Fox News presenter was spotted in Moscow, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=305.5s)]
*  Carlson was the most popular host at Fox News before he was abruptly fired last [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=310.02s)]
*  April. Now let's stop there for a second and let us recall that to this day, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=315.26s)]
*  almost a year later, Fox News has provided no explanation even to its own [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=319.94s)]
*  viewers as to why Tucker Carlson was fired from Fox. To me there has never [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=325.3s)]
*  been any doubt about why. It is because he is a dissident of Republican [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=332.1s)]
*  establishment orthodoxy. Tucker did not spend most of his time on Fox criticizing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  the Democratic Party, he spent most of his time criticizing the Republican [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=343.1s)]
*  establishment, people like Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, he had contempt for them. And the Murdochs, it's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=353.54s)]
*  well known, have long supported the pre-Trump establishment party and want to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=359.26s)]
*  bring the Republican Party back in line with that pre-Trump ideology. And what [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=363.5s)]
*  made a lot of Republican establishment Republicans particularly furious about [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=370.74s)]
*  Tucker and when he was fired, they anonymously celebrated like the little [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=375.78s)]
*  rats that they are running around in those sewers underneath the Capitol [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=380.18s)]
*  meeting with reporters maligning Tucker but only anonymously, they don't have [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=385.22s)]
*  the courage to use the real name and they were saying essentially that they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  were happy he was fired because now their lives would be much easier sending [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  American money to Ukraine now if they don't have the most influential voice [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  and most trustworthy voice among American conservatives opposing the war. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  I firmly believe that the reason he was fired is because he was using this [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=405.5s)]
*  gigantic platform, the biggest on Fox, not to disseminate establishment [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=411.26s)]
*  Republican orthodoxy but critiquing it and opposing it and whatever else the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=417.02s)]
*  Murdochs are, capitalists and billionaires, they are also highly [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=422.5s)]
*  politicized actors. Remember it was Rupert Murdoch who funded the Weekly [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=426.58s)]
*  Standard, the magazine long run by Bill Kristol during the war on terror to push [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=431.8s)]
*  neocon ideology and if Tucker hates anything he hates neocons. The Guardian [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=435.7s)]
*  went on quote, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=441.46s)]
*  How many times are they going to use the word right-wing in this article? It's now [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=447.14s)]
*  three times we're not even in the past the first paragraph. Everything is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=450.82s)]
*  designed to signify to the readers what to think and what to feel using these [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=455.26s)]
*  labels. To distribute a right-wing talk show, Tucker on X, Carlson has since [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=459.5s)]
*  echoed many of the Kremlin's talking points in its war against Ukraine, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=465.86s)]
*  slamming Washington for its support of Ukraine while suggesting the West is to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=470.14s)]
*  blame for the invasion. Now this is I think one of the most insidious themes [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=474.46s)]
*  that has entered our discourse and actually it's been around for a long [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=480.82s)]
*  time. The idea that if you oppose the involvement of the United States in a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=483.94s)]
*  foreign war it means you are automatically on the other side that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=489.42s)]
*  you are a supporter of whoever the United States wants to go to war with [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=493.42s)]
*  and that you are spouting the talking points of America's enemies simply by [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  virtue of opposing the war because obviously it's always in the interest of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=504.06s)]
*  whatever country the US wants to go to war with for someone in the United States [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=507.38s)]
*  to stand up and say I don't want my country involved in this war. I don't [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=511.86s)]
*  want my country financing this war against that country and this framework [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=515.82s)]
*  that they are imposing, namely that if you oppose the war in Ukraine and having [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=520.5s)]
*  the United States pay for it you're somehow echoing Kremlin talking points [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=528.22s)]
*  is so malignant. This is what was done to people who opposed the war in Vietnam [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=532.22s)]
*  that you were serving the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=539.1400000000001s)]
*  communist leader because you are opposed to the US war in Vietnam if you were [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=545.06s)]
*  against the US war in Iraq, the invasion of Iraq, you were pushing Saddam Hussein [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=549.66s)]
*  talking points because Saddam Hussein was saying it's an illegal and unjust [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=554.3399999999999s)]
*  invasion and if you were an American saying that too you were echoing Saddam [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=559.26s)]
*  Hussein's talking points. Same with the effort to overthrow Bashar al-Assad if [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=562.5s)]
*  you wanted your country not to do that you got accused of being a pro-Assad [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=567.26s)]
*  propaganda. Same with the attempt to change the regime in Libya if you were [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=572.98s)]
*  opposed to that somehow you were echoing Muammar Gaddafi's interests. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=576.9s)]
*  Wanting the US to withdraw from Afghanistan meant you were pushing the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=581.7s)]
*  Taliban agenda and the Russian agenda. Do you see what they've done? They've made [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=586.1s)]
*  it so that any dissent to US foreign policy especially the US policy of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=590.7s)]
*  endless wars which enriches the large corporations that fund both parties [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=596.54s)]
*  automatically makes you a traitor. Means that you are espousing the talking [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=601.78s)]
*  points of this other country. Now, Tukhara had said so many times that he knew [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=607.18s)]
*  almost nothing about Russia. He had no interest in Russia. He had never been [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=612.22s)]
*  until this trip and his opposition to the US funding of the war in Ukraine was [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=617.06s)]
*  based on his view that he espoused many other times that the United States [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=623.54s)]
*  should not be funding foreign wars especially when it has no interest in the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=628.54s)]
*  American people. That's a common view in American political life. If you poll [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=631.5s)]

*  government. Now do you see how they say Carlson claimed this? Carlson recently [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=786.64s)]
*  claimed. So is it true? The Guardian really tries to imply that he was almost [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=794.18s)]
*  lying. He just claimed it like it was some baseless crazy conspiracy theory. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=802.8199999999999s)]
*  They have no interest in whether or not it's true. They should have a lot of interest in whether or not the United States government acted to intervene in a journalist attempt to interview the Russian president. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=808.3399999999999s)]
*  It would be a pretty severe threat to a free press. Something the Guardian [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=824.02s)]
*  pretends to claim to care about. We reported on the time. At the time I know [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=831.9s)]
*  what happened in this case. It's absolutely true. The evidence that the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=838.1s)]

*  the Russian president while he was at Fox News is extremely persuasive and [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=848.42s)]
*  conclusive in fact. And yet it was because of Tucker Carlson and because most [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=852.82s)]
*  people in American journalism as we're now seeing think that a journalist [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=858.5s)]
*  should not go and interview this foreign leader even though prior to Trump it had [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=862.22s)]
*  been a basic tradition of American journalism to go and interview every [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=868.1s)]
*  foreign leader you can get your hands on including America's most devoted enemies. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  The most prominent journalists in the United States have always done that and [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=876.7800000000001s)]
*  for good reason. You want to hear from those people. You want to confront them [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=881.62s)]
*  with questions that you want to hear them answer. But now we are so drowning in [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=886.6999999999999s)]
*  this kind of neocon ideology that you don't question your government's wars. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=893.8199999999999s)]
*  You just sit and applaud and the last thing you do is let the countries that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=899.8199999999999s)]
*  want to go to war with be heard. They have no interest in whether or not the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=905.22s)]
*  U.S. government tried to impede Tucker Carlson from interviewing Vladimir Putin [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=908.66s)]
*  because I'm sure they actually think that that's what the proper role of the U.S. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=912.38s)]
*  government is. Here is Tucker Carlson in 2021 explaining exactly what happened. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=916.34s)]
*  The largest intelligence gathering agency the NSA had been reading my private [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=921.66s)]
*  emails even saying that out loud is weird. It's one of those segments we never [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=928.1s)]
*  thought we would do ever but the country has changed that much that fast and [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=931.3s)]
*  honestly the whole thing was kind of shocking. The government was spying on us. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=935.5s)]
*  Come on. It seemed crazy but it's true and no one in Washington appeared to be [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=939.1800000000001s)]
*  shocked in the slightest. In fact the usual shills right after our segment had [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  a ready explanation for it. Either it never happened at all they said just a [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=947.9000000000001s)]
*  cable news show lying for ratings or there must have been a good reason it [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=951.86s)]
*  happened and they began furiously making excuses for why the NSA did it. A powerful [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=956.86s)]
*  heavily politicized spy agency surveilling journalists who've been [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=961.7s)]
*  critical of the regime? No problem. It's perfectly normal. Just don't call it [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=964.62s)]
*  spying. But it's not normal at all. It is third world and as we told you repeatedly [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=968.54s)]
*  it did happen. Now that has been confirmed. Yesterday we learned that [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=975.18s)]
*  sources in the so-called intelligence community told at least one reporter in [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=979.3s)]
*  Washington what was in those emails. My emails. There was nothing scandalous in [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=983.5s)]
*  there thank God. We're happy to report that. Late this spring I contacted a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=988.3s)]
*  couple of people I thought could help get us an interview with Russian [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=992.1s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin. I told nobody I was doing this other than my executive [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=994.58s)]
*  producer Justin Wells. I wasn't embarrassed about trying to interview [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=998.82s)]
*  Putin. He's obviously newsworthy. I'm an American citizen. I can interview anyone [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1002.26s)]
*  I want and I plan to. But still in this case I decided to keep it quiet. I [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1006.62s)]
*  figured that any kind of publicity would rattle the Russians and make the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1011.46s)]
*  interview less likely to happen. But the Biden administration found out anyway by [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1014.86s)]
*  reading my emails. I learned from a whistleblower the NSA planned to leak [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1019.22s)]
*  the contents of those emails to media outlets. Why would they do that? Well the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1023.78s)]
*  point of course was to paint me as a disloyal American. A Russian operative [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1028.54s)]
*  been called that before. A stooge of the Kremlin. A traitor doing the bidding of a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1032.8600000000001s)]
*  foreign adversary. And of course I'm the hardly the only person who has been [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1036.78s)]
*  accused of those things in the last several years. We've seen this movie [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1041.02s)]
*  several times now. At the same moment the Communist Chinese government increases [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1043.98s)]
*  its already stunning level of control over this country. Our leaders prattle on [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1048.66s)]
*  about the threat of Vladimir Putin. He's an evil doer they tell us. A totalitarian [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1053.02s)]
*  dictator. Vladimir Putin does things that no American leader would even consider. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1058.6200000000001s)]
*  He runs domestic disinformation campaigns. He lies to the public. He [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1063.8600000000001s)]
*  punishes people for opposing him or for believing the wrong things. He even uses [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1068.5s)]
*  intelligence agencies to spy on his own citizens. Beyond the pale stuff. So no [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1074.06s)]
*  decent American would interview Vladimir Putin. At least no reporter from Fox News. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1079.98s)]
*  That was the point they wanted to make. That's why they plan to leak the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1084.1799999999998s)]
*  contents of my emails to news organizations. And yesterday as noted we [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1087.86s)]
*  learned they actually did it. Even now some of the media are claiming that we [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1092.46s)]
*  deserve this. Emailing with people who know Putin are you? Of course the NSA is [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1096.5s)]
*  watching you. That's what you get. Now this was eight full years after we did [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1101.3s)]
*  the reporting enabled by our source Edward Snowden. And right before we began [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1107.5s)]
*  that reporting the Justice Department under Eric Holder had been caught spying on [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1113.06s)]
*  multiple American journalists including James Rosen of Fox News and two [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1118.74s)]
*  reporters at the Associated Press. And a big part of our reporting was that the [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1123.44s)]
*  NSA had been abusing its spying mechanisms designed to identify threats to the [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1128.3s)]
*  United States and instead was spying on all kinds of American citizens with no [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1134.22s)]
*  words including American journalists. And the fact of the matter is that people [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1138.86s)]
*  inside the government confirmed to Tucker Carlson exactly what the content [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1146.54s)]
*  of his emails were. And then they leaked them to the media. Proof that they were [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1151.7s)]
*  in fact spying on his emails as he tried to arrange an interview. I would be [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1157.18s)]
*  surprised if you even remember that because of how little media attention it [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1163.66s)]
*  received. And the reason is that they as he said they think it's warranted and if [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1166.66s)]
*  you doubt that look at the reaction to the news that Tucker visited Russia was [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1174.02s)]
*  seen physically in Moscow. Here from the weepy former Republican congressman Adam [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1181.62s)]
*  Kinzinger who knew better than to seek reelection and ran into the arms of CNN [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1191.02s)]
*  he was responding to a report that read quote Tucker Carlson has been in Moscow [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1196.4599999999998s)]

*  Bolshoi Theatre today. And there you see a picture of him with the very storied [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1205.8999999999999s)]
*  seats at the Bolshoi Ballet which I've been to it's extremely beautiful. If you [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1211.38s)]

*  And in response Adam Kinzinger who has the flags of three four of three of two [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1221.6200000000001s)]

*  flag and the Israeli flag. So America and the two countries whose wars were [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1234.02s)]
*  currently financing with the long-term fascist phrase Slava-Ukrania which has [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1238.18s)]

*  this news Adam Kinzinger said quote he is a traitor for going to Russia and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1249.3000000000002s)]
*  appearing at the Bolshoi Ballet. Do you see how completely deranged these people [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1256.74s)]
*  are? And again Adam Kinzinger was in the Congress for several terms and then knew [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1261.9s)]
*  he couldn't be reelected within the Republican Party. He avoided Liz Cheney's [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1266.86s)]

*  avoided that fate and ran into the loving comforting arms of CNN where he's [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1285.2199999999998s)]
*  now an analyst. So CNN employs somebody who accuses an American journalist of [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1289.1s)]

*  American culture as his hero. Real whistleblowers end up like Julian [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1322.3s)]
*  Assange Edward Snowden in exile or in prison. They don't end up writing [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1328.72s)]

*  never suffered anything Alexander Vindman. He's not a hero he's a coward and [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1344.74s)]
*  he's Ukrainian, an American Ukrainian, and has been obsessed with having the [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1349.7s)]
*  United States and American citizens who are hard-working, paid for Ukraine's war. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1353.98s)]
*  And here's what he said in response to the news that Tucker Carlson committed [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1357.22s)]
*  the crime of visiting Russia quote, Tucker is aiding and abetting the enemy. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1362.5400000000002s)]
*  The same enemy that threatens us with nuclear weapons interferes in our [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1367.5400000000002s)]
*  election allies with the raw North Korean Hamas. This is who Tucker courts. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1371.9s)]
*  Again by no stretch of the imagination in any legal or constitutional sense is [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1378.46s)]
*  Russia an American enemy. You're allowed to visit Russia, you're allowed to [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1384.22s)]
*  interview whoever you want in Moscow. It's not against the law by any [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1389.54s)]
*  reasonable interpretation. These people are absolutely deranged. This is what [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1394.6200000000001s)]
*  authoritarianism looks like. This is the mindset of authoritarianism. This is if [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1402.8200000000002s)]
*  you visit a country you're a traitor to your own or if you're a journalist and [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1407.9s)]
*  you want to interview a foreign leader you're somehow guilty of the most [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1414.14s)]
*  serious crime in the US code for which capital punishment is applied. Here was a [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1417.7s)]
*  viral tweet by a vehement supporter of Ukraine and really a basic American [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1424.74s)]
*  liberal who said the following if Tucker Carlson is in Moscow as the guest of [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1432.5400000000002s)]

*  you see it was retweeted by 2,000 people like by 16,000. Now this person is a [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1442.06s)]
*  coward calling for the murder of other people while hiding behind anonymity. I [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1449.42s)]
*  mean think of an act more cowardly than that it's almost hard to imagine but [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1453.62s)]
*  this is their mindset these people who support Ukraine and have aligned with [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1459.46s)]
*  these neo-nazi militias in Ukraine. I've been put on lists issued by the Ukrainian [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1463.78s)]
*  intelligence calling me a pro-Russian propagandist because I don't think my [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1472.26s)]
*  country should be fueling that war with American money along with a bunch of [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1476.02s)]
*  other people in media and politics. This is how authoritarian these war [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1480.86s)]
*  Here is Guy Verhoestophe who is a longtime official in the EU and there you see his [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1487.78s)]

*  a member of the European Parliament which is what MEP is but I believe he [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1517.3799999999999s)]
*  used to be if I'm not mistaken the Prime Minister of Belgium and a high official [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1520.3799999999999s)]
*  in the EU but he's a member of the EU Parliament and he's a vehement supporter [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1524.58s)]
*  of the war in Ukraine and he has this picture of again Tucker Carlson [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1528.8999999999999s)]
*  committing the war crime of visiting a ballet the Bolshoi ballet and in response [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1534.1799999999998s)]
*  to this picture he says quote Tucker Carlson is surely on the path to being [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1541.3799999999999s)]
*  labeled a propagandist for the Russian regime if he enables disinformation [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1545.3799999999999s)]
*  for Putin the EU should explore a travel ban they're going to exclude American [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1550.1399999999999s)]
*  citizens who pay for their defense Europe's because he went and interviewed [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1558.1s)]
*  a foreign leader and because he opposes the American EU war in Ukraine they want [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1565.06s)]
*  to exclude him from any country in the EU these people constantly portrayed [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1571.7s)]
*  themselves as the guardians against authoritarianism when in reality they [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1579.14s)]
*  are the supreme perpetrators of it speaking of neocon scumbags the supreme [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1583.9s)]
*  one Bill Kristol obviously reacted to this story as well and said quote [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1591.78s)]
*  perhaps we need a total and complete shutdown of Tucker Carlson re-entering [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1597.66s)]
*  the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1602.14s)]

*  ban on citizens of certain Muslim countries during the 2016 campaign but [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1610.46s)]
*  he's also very seriously arguing that Tucker Carlson should be banned from [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1616.46s)]
*  re-entering the United States something that would be blatantly unconstitutional [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1619.66s)]
*  but even the mere suggestion of it shows how I can't express how how completely [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1623.8200000000002s)]
*  unhinged establishment liberal and neocon discourse has become these people [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1632.3000000000002s)]

*  and got celebrated for it by the media even though it's a complete subversion of [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMO6Ckwgsg&t=1659.42s)]
