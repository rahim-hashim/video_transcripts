# From Mangled Puppy To Joyous Dog: Pulo's Incredible Rescue Story
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog)
*  We like to end our show on a happy note happier even than I just was analyzing that whole New York Times debacle and one of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=0.0s)]
*  The ways we want to do that especially ending the week is we have a new series that we're calling system update [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=6.18s)]
*  Which is designed to feature one of our many many dogs that we've rescued [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=12.1s)]
*  Over the years we have 26 dogs at home another [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=17.06s)]
*  150 or so at our shelter each one of them has a unique [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=20.64s)]
*  Rescue story that I think really reveals a lot the this is the third installment [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=23.68s)]
*  the third week that we're doing it the star of the show is pull oh and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=28.0s)]
*  It's a little bit sad. This is the second of the of the dogs of the three that we've [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=33.28s)]
*  Done who has recently passed away. He passed away about four months ago. I believe now [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=39.44s)]
*  But he passed away basically from old age. We rescued him in 2007 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=44.84s)]
*  He was the second rescue dog that David and I rescued together the third dog ever in our pack [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  We rescued a lot of dogs between 2007 2010. So a lot of them are getting to that age where [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=56.24s)]
*  They've had a long full life and that's why this is happening with somewhat frequently, but his resting story is really amazing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=62.32s)]
*  It's I find it actually quite inspiring to see what dogs can overcome and what they can become [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=68.2s)]
*  Despite a very very difficult start to their life and here is the video illustrating and highlighting his trajectory [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=73.28s)]
*  Hey everybody our guest starring dog of the week is pull pull has [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=80.7s)]
*  One of the most amazing stories of any dogs I've ever known he [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=86.7s)]
*  Is obviously very old now we we got him in 2007 David rescued him from the street in a story [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=92.22s)]
*  I'll tell him second that means he's about to turn 17 which for a dog his size. He's not a small dog. I [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=97.7s)]
*  Is very very old [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=104.78s)]
*  So it's easy to look at him. He's obviously debilitated [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=106.78s)]
*  He has trouble standing up or getting up and staying on his feet [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=108.78s)]
*  So we have a lot of physiotherapy for him still out of like ways to you know [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=112.78s)]
*  Give him a good quality of life. He still has quality of life in him and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=116.78s)]
*  It's amazing how old he is actually we don't have any other dogs from that period in our lives that we rescued who are still alive [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=120.78s)]
*  And pull a story is amazing in part that he had such a great life [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=128.78s)]
*  Is amazing in part that he had such longevity because when we found him he was in absolutely terrible shape [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=133.78s)]
*  He was living on the street with a woman who was homeless. She had three or four dogs with her [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=140.78s)]
*  He was the youngest one. I think he had just been born about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=146.38s)]
*  Two or three months earlier to one of the other dogs that she had and she kept him [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=149.78s)]
*  I mean a lot of stray dogs when they're babies puppies they wander away [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=154.14s)]
*  That's their instinct but Pulo stayed and before he could get away he got hit by a car and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=158.7s)]
*  David was walking by and saw him on the street in obvious pain really agony. His body was kind of twisted and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  He talked to this woman and she said look I love this dog, but I cannot take care of him [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=173.94s)]
*  I can't get him any of the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  Medical care that he needs and I can't take care of him like even if I could in the recovery [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=181.17999999999998s)]
*  And if you would take him I would be so grateful [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=186.06s)]
*  so David, you know tried to say like look we'll help you and she just you know refused because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=187.98s)]
*  it was a lot of work on top of all the expenses and so we picked him up and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=192.86s)]
*  Among other of his injuries he had [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=197.9s)]
*  you can see here his paw has always been it was completely broken and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=200.66s)]
*  We had to find he also had a broken elbow a broken shoulder here as well [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=205.94s)]
*  So we had to find these specialists these surgeons who? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=210.54s)]
*  At the time it was a pretty new procedure [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=214.86s)]
*  It's more common now [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=216.58s)]
*  But they put metal plates in his paw and in his shoulder in order to just give him support so we could use that leg [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=217.5s)]
*  And after those surgeries he had to stay in a tiny little box [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  23 and a half hours a day because it was important he not stand up and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  Put pressure on those plates because they could break or become dislodged [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=233.46s)]
*  Remember it was so horrible. We had to keep him in this tiny box [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=237.62s)]
*  23 and a half hours a day [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  We only just kind of let him out there lay on the ground. We wouldn't let him stand up and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=242.26s)]
*  It was terrible. I mean he was necessary, but I felt so bad for him and so [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=246.5s)]
*  If David were here you would tell you that the minute poor was finally able to get out of his box [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  I completely spoiled him. I just I [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=255.82s)]
*  Just treated him like a little tiny baby who deserved everything because of all that he had gone through [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  And as a result David would tell you he's a little bit of a weird dog and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=264.5s)]
*  Would say it's all my fault because of how much I spoiled him [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=269.06s)]
*  So he has never been a normal dog [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=272.26s)]
*  He's just like is always weird the way he walks is weird because of these metal plates the way he behaves is weird [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=274.06s)]
*  But with me and other humans he could not be a more loving dog. He's just very agitated around people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=279.98s)]
*  He doesn't know he gets get snappy with other dogs [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=286.8s)]
*  but given everything that he went through and had to get fixed and all the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=289.86s)]
*  Like injury and sickness he had when he was a small puppy to see him 17 years later [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=294.94s)]
*  Still look, I mean you can just tell I mean he's super alert. He like loves affection [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=300.62s)]
*  As long as you sit with him, he's happy, you know, he'll whine a little bit if you don't he has to wear diapers because he [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=307.78s)]
*  Can't stand up all the time in order to urinate or deprecate you obviously don't want him doing that on himself [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  but one of the hardest things is a when you have dogs and it's also one of the most important is to be able to know when [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=319.46s)]
*  The quality of life of your dog is no longer high enough to make their life have value when especially [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=327.06s)]
*  To know when they're suffering outweighs the satisfaction happiness that they get nobody likes to have to make that decision to euthanize their dogs [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=333.41999999999996s)]
*  But it's something you have to do for the dog for yourself [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=340.53999999999996s)]
*  Even though you want to keep the dog around for as long as possible sometimes for selfish reasons, even though they're well intentioned [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=344.9s)]
*  You know, you don't want a dog to just spend most of its day suffering and obviously as dogs get older like humans [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=350.94s)]
*  They're going to have bad days [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=357.58s)]
*  They're gonna have some health issues that are gonna cause some discomfort [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=359.14s)]
*  But as long as they're still able to interact well and to get the things that dogs care about most which is human love and human [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=363.02s)]
*  interaction and give that back then, you know, there's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=369.82s)]
*  Not really a hard choice Pula for us is a very special dog [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=374.53999999999996s)]
*  Because he was actually the second dog that David and I adopted together when I moved to Brazil [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=378.62s)]
*  I had one puppy that I had adopted in New York and then David and I rescued a second dog and Pula was the third [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  One we ever got so he's like one of the founding fathers of our pack [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, obviously all of our dogs are very important to us [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=392.54s)]
*  but for me he has a kind of special symbolism and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=395.22s)]
*  I'm thrilled that he's still around. He's still having a not such an active life, but still a happy life like on balance life [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=398.78000000000003s)]
*  That's worth living [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  But I do think sometimes I know I have this a lot in the beginning with dogs was [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=406.82000000000005s)]
*  You know [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=411.82000000000005s)]
*  You'd make selfish decisions and postpone what you knew was the right choice because you didn't want to have to face the emotional [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=412.42s)]
*  turmoil and sadness and pain of signing a form that meant that five minutes later your dog was going to be euthanized but [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=417.94s)]
*  over time you come to learn that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=425.22s)]
*  You have to feel good about that decision because you know, you made a hard decision that was best for the dog and ultimately for yourself [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=427.3s)]
*  But was definitely at the point yet [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=433.62s)]
*  Obviously that point it will come when he's so debilitated that he can't have a happy life or he will just die of natural causes [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=435.14s)]
*  One of the things you have to accept with dogs is they do have a shorter lifespan than humans and it's so important to accept [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=442.74s)]
*  That from the beginning be conscious of that so that you're not [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=448.53999999999996s)]
*  connecting to them like your children [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=452.26s)]
*  Because you don't want to experience the loss of a child every you know, 10 years and I've seen people [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=454.94s)]
*  Get to who treat their dogs too much like humans and when they die, they're so devastated that they just never [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=460.62s)]
*  Want to get another dog again to not have to go through that that's sad to deny yourself that so it's important to think [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=466.62s)]
*  About them in the right way. One of the things they teach us is about the cycle of life and death [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=471.18s)]
*  This is one of the gifts they give us even though we wish their lives are longer. The reality is it's not but that's full of story [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=476.34000000000003s)]
*  It's of course a long story. It's an ample story a rich story, but it's also [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=483.14000000000004s)]
*  You know you can look at Paul and think oh poor baby and have some sympathy for him, but the reality is he has had [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=486.94s)]
*  The best possible life he could possibly have given the start of his life and he's brought a lot of happiness for us as well [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfytXY1DKog&t=492.54s)]
