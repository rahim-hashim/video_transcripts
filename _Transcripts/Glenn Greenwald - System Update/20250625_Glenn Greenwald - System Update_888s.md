# Prof. John Mearsheimer Warns of Israel/Iran NIGHTMARE SCENARIO
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM)
*  I was thinking about the trajectory of your appearances here and I start with this a lot [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=0.0s)]
*  because it seems like it kind of paralleled what has actually happened. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=12.68s)]
*  I remember after October 7th, one of the things we most frequently discussed was the danger [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=16.32s)]
*  that the Israeli destruction of Gaza, which the US paid for and armed, could then lead [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=21.16s)]
*  to broader regional conflict. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=27.88s)]
*  We talked about the possibility that they would then attack Hezbollah, that they could [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=29.26s)]
*  do something in Syria to destabilize Syria, and ultimately the biggest concern was that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=31.94s)]
*  it could then lead to what was the cherry on top of the cake for the Israelis, which [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=36.78s)]
*  was a US and Israeli attack on Iran, which we now have witnessed over the last two weeks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=40.46s)]
*  So I want to begin by asking you about the pretext or the justification that was used [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=49.92s)]
*  for this clearly preemptive or preventative attack on Iran. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=56.9s)]
*  Iran didn't attack Israel, they weren't attacking the United States, they weren't threatening [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=61.62s)]
*  to do so, and the justification we were given was that Iran had become closer than ever [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=64.46s)]
*  to developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=72.17999999999999s)]
*  They were actively attempting to acquire nuclear weapons, that if they acquired them, there [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=73.68s)]
*  was a very good probability, certainly more so than any other nuclear armed country, to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  use a nuclear weapon either against Israel and or the United States and was therefore [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=84.0s)]
*  an existential threat we had to deal with immediately. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=88.06s)]
*  What do you think of that justification just in terms of its ferocity or lack thereof? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=91.72s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, Glenn, there is no evidence that the Iranians were pursuing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=96.38s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, and I think almost all the intelligence agencies agree on that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=105.02s)]
*  The IAEA, the inspectors who have been in there for a long time watching very carefully [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=112.94s)]
*  what the Israelis, excuse me, what the Iranians have been doing, agree that they're not pursuing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  a bomb. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  The problem from Israel's point of view is that they are not that far away from a point [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=124.92s)]
*  where they could build a bomb, and that's in large part because the Iranians have the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=133.16s)]
*  capability to enrich uranium, and they've enriched it up to 60 percent. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=138.44s)]
*  If you enrich uranium to 90 percent, you are in a position where you are producing weapons-grade [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=143.62s)]
*  uranium. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=150.38s)]
*  So all this is to say that the Iranians are a threshold state. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=151.38s)]
*  They're not a nuclear weapons state, and they're not pursuing nuclear weapons, but they've [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=157.06s)]
*  marched down to the five-yard line to put it in football terms, and they are allowed [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=162.3s)]
*  to do that as a member of the NPT. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=170.4s)]
*  You're allowed to enrich uranium, so they're doing nothing that's illegal or nothing that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=173.4s)]
*  is wrong according to international law. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=180.18s)]
*  They have the right to enrich uranium up to 60 percent, but again, that leaves them as [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=183.8s)]
*  a threshold state. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=189.0s)]
*  The Israelis consider this unacceptable, and what the Israelis want to do is they want [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=190.96s)]
*  to eliminate their ability to enrich uranium completely, but that's only goal number one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=196.82000000000002s)]
*  Goal number two, which we should also talk about, is regime change. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=204.24s)]
*  The Israelis are interested in more than just eliminating Iran's nuclear capability. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=208.44s)]
*  They want to effect a regime change. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=216.3s)]
*  Those are the two broad goals. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=218.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I called the claims about the nuclear program and the threats and fears [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  of it a pretext because I think ultimately the real goal, much more so than the attack [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  on the nuclear program, which might have been part of the goal, but the real goal was and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  is regime change. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  I want to get to that, of course, in a second, but before we do, I just want to stay on this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=236.22s)]
*  topic a little bit. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=239.0s)]
*  You had mentioned that Iran, under the NPT, nuclear nonproliferation treaty, has the right, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=241.38s)]
*  like every other state, to enrich uranium to whatever levels they want. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=246.38s)]
*  They just can't weaponize that uranium even if they could and acquire a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=249.5s)]
*  They have inspection obligations, but there was a time when Iran did have actual limitations [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=255.26s)]
*  on the extent to which they could enrich, namely when they entered into this deal in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=261.98s)]
*  2015 that was very painstakingly negotiated with the entire world where Iran voluntarily [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=267.62s)]
*  accepted a limit on its ability to enrich uranium that no other country has, namely [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=273.4s)]
*  they wouldn't enrich uranium past 3.6 or 3.7 percent the amount you need for nuclear energy [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=277.94s)]
*  but not for a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=282.94s)]
*  They also agreed to far more invasive and rigorous inspections and monitoring and surveillance [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=286.86s)]
*  than they have the obligation under the NPT to provide to the IAEA as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=292.48s)]
*  Do you think it's fair to say that Donald Trump's decision to unilaterally rip up that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=298.3s)]
*  agreement and his failure and then Joe Biden's failure over four years to enter into a new [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=304.02s)]
*  agreement with Iran that would also provide that same framework of monitoring and surveillance [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=311.02s)]
*  of same limits played a major role in how we got to this place where the Israelis perceived [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=315.98s)]
*  that a war was necessary? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=321.98s)]
*  Well, I think that it would have been eminently wise for the Israelis to accept the JCPOA. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=323.94s)]
*  That's the 2015 agreement that President Obama negotiated with the Iranians. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=333.9s)]
*  It was not a terrific deal from the Israelis' point of view. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  I fully understand that because it did allow Iran to continue enriching uranium, but it [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=345.46s)]
*  was the least bad alternative by far and it was not a bad agreement. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=351.94s)]
*  And I think just to pick up on what you were saying that President Biden and now President [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=357.62s)]
*  Trump would have been wise to have gone to a new variant of the JCPOA. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=362.3s)]
*  I think the biggest problem from my point of view with the original JCPOA, this is the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=369.1s)]
*  2015 one, is that it had sunset clauses. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  In other words, it ran out over time. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=377.66s)]
*  I think if they could... [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=380.3s)]
*  Two years, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  It wasn't like two years. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  It was 10, 15 years in the future. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=386.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=387.3s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=388.3s)]
*  So 2015 was now 10 years ago. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=389.3s)]
*  True. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=392.22s)]
*  But anyway, I think that you could have put in place a new JCPOA that did not have sunset [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=393.22s)]
*  clauses and that could have shut down this problem for a long, long time, if not once [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=400.74s)]
*  and for all. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=406.94s)]
*  I think at the same time, what you had to do is you had to take your gun sights off [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=408.18s)]
*  the Iranians. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=412.26s)]
*  The problem is that the Israelis and the Americans have their gun sights on Iran, which gives [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=413.26s)]
*  them a very powerful incentive to be a threshold nuclear state, which is why they want to be [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=418.46s)]
*  able to enrich all the way up to weapons grade material. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=425.02s)]
*  But if you took away the threat and you took away the sanctions and you tried to have some [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=429.42s)]
*  sort of rapprochement with the Iranians, I think the JCPOA would work very well. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=434.74s)]
*  And again, it's the least bad alternative because the idea that you're going to bomb [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=442.34s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear weapons program to the point where they can't develop bombs is delusional. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  It just can't be done. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=456.09999999999997s)]
*  Let me ask you about the kind of fear mongering, though, that did exist, was purposely propagated [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=459.14s)]
*  around the idea that Iran was getting closer to a nuclear weapon, which as you say, they [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  were enriching at 60%. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  First of all, even if you develop a nuclear weapon, you still need a delivery system in [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=476.3s)]
*  order to drop it on the country that people say you want to drop it on, which is another [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=479.7s)]
*  pretty significant barrier to figure out how to put on a warhead, how to put it on a missile, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=487.54s)]
*  or how to put it in a plane. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=492.86s)]
*  But beyond that, I think the more interesting question is we do have a lot of nuclear states, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=494.46s)]
*  including states like Pakistan and India and North Korea, to say nothing of the members [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=500.54s)]
*  of the Security Council. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=508.06s)]
*  And I think we saw with the United States and North Korea when there were tensions, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  we backed away almost certainly because they are a nuclear power and we have to take that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=515.22s)]
*  seriously as a matter of deterrence. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=519.4200000000001s)]
*  I think in the India-Pakistan war that broke out for a couple weeks, that got pretty intense [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=521.5s)]
*  between two countries that have deep-seated hatred and distrust for one another. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=525.54s)]
*  There was a pretty quick end to that as well. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=530.0s)]
*  They were very careful about the escalatory ladder because both are nuclear-armed powers. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=531.68s)]
*  And that has been the basis of nuclear strategy since other countries besides the United States [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=535.88s)]
*  got it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=542.64s)]
*  It was like, look, you can use it, but we have second strike capability. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=543.64s)]
*  We'll see it coming. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=547.24s)]
*  We can launch before it hits. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=548.24s)]
*  And it's mutual assured destruction, meaning if you want to use it against us, you can, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=550.0s)]
*  but you're going to get obliterated instantly and your whole country is going to be vaporized. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=554.24s)]
*  And that has been the reason why there's been this deterrence that has kept the peace. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=558.16s)]
*  We got close to nuclear war with Russia in 1962, but even there, we sort of backed out [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  maybe by luck. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=567.16s)]
*  But since then, I don't think there's been a lot of instances of that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=568.16s)]
*  So what we're being told is that, look, deterrence works even for India-Pakistan. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  It works for North Korea and Kim Jong-un and the society that we're told is kind of like [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=575.76s)]
*  a maniacal cult, but it won't work for Iran. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=579.8399999999999s)]
*  Iran would use it against Israel, might use it against the United States, even though [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  they know they would be instantly vaporized if they did, because the leaders of Iran don't [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=586.98s)]
*  really care about preserving their lives. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=593.22s)]
*  They're actually part of an apocalyptic end times death glorifying cult. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=595.72s)]
*  And the greatest wish they have is to be martyred and to die for some sort of jihad. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=600.6400000000001s)]
*  And therefore, they're not susceptible to the same rational pragmatic considerations [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=606.1s)]
*  or enlightened self-interest that all other countries are governed by. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=610.98s)]
*  Based on what you know about Iran, based on what we've seen Iran do over the past couple [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=615.7s)]
*  years, including just now, do you think there's any truth to that? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=619.86s)]
*  No, I think it's a myth. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=624.62s)]
*  The Iranians have not started a war in 200 plus years. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=627.94s)]
*  The idea that Iran is this warlike country that's run by wild and crazy leaders who are [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=633.22s)]
*  just looking for an opportunity to nuke Israel or nuke their Arab neighbors is a ludicrous [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=640.02s)]
*  argument. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=647.02s)]
*  The Iranians don't want to disappear from the face of the earth any more than the Israelis [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=650.1s)]
*  do. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=654.5s)]
*  The point you're making, Glenn, is basically that nuclear weapons are a powerful force [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=657.5s)]
*  for peace. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=661.78s)]
*  And I think there's no question that if every state in the Middle East had nuclear weapons, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=663.14s)]
*  it would be a more stable region. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=668.62s)]
*  But the problem with that argument is that you cannot guarantee that they won't be used. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=671.74s)]
*  And even if there's only a 1% or half a percent chance that those nuclear weapons will be [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=678.62s)]
*  used, you'd prefer that Iran not have nuclear weapons. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=684.82s)]
*  And you would certainly prefer that not every state in the region have nuclear weapons. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=689.22s)]
*  But you can't deter, building on your rhetoric, that nuclear weapons create stability. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=694.1s)]
*  They do, but they're not perfect. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  And again, the great danger is that somebody will use them. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=701.78s)]
*  Now, with regard to the Iranians and the Israelis, if you ask me what country in the international [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=705.22s)]
*  system today is most likely to use nuclear weapons, I would say it's Israel. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=711.74s)]
*  And I think the nightmare scenario that we have to worry about is that the Israelis believe [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=717.9s)]
*  that Iran getting nuclear weapons is an existential threat. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=724.98s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=728.78s)]
*  They have this view that the Iranians, if they get nuclear weapons, will use them against [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=730.54s)]
*  Israel. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=734.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, at this point in time, it looks like the Iranians have very powerful incentives [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=735.8199999999999s)]
*  weapons, given what's happened over the past 12 days and even before that. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=744.54s)]
*  And furthermore, it looks like they have the capability because we've been unable to eliminate [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=749.86s)]
*  it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=754.5799999999999s)]
*  So the question you want to ask yourself is what are the Israelis likely to do if Iran [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=755.5799999999999s)]
*  actually does develop a nuclear weapon? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=760.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think the Israelis will have a very powerful incentive to go in and take out that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=764.74s)]
*  capability before it's realized. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=769.5799999999999s)]
*  And the question then you have to ask yourself is how can they do that? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=772.38s)]
*  And it's quite clear that the only way they can do it is with nuclear weapons. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=777.0600000000001s)]
*  And do you think the Israelis would use nuclear weapons if Iran were on the threshold of getting [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=782.38s)]
*  a bomb? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=790.5400000000001s)]
*  I think there is a reasonably good chance that they would. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=791.7s)]
*  So what I worry about is not the Iranians getting nuclear weapons and using them against [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=795.6600000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=799.94s)]
*  I worry about the Israelis using nuclear weapons against Iran when Iran is in the process of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=800.94s)]
*  acquiring a deterrent. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=806.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=807.6600000000001s)]
*  The idea that we're claiming and characterizing Iran as this group of people led by end times [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=809.7800000000001s)]
*  religious fanatics is so ironic given that that kind of mentality pervades the US Congress [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=815.94s)]
*  and the executive branch in terms of how they shape foreign policy and the ideological or [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=823.1800000000001s)]
*  theocratic foundations. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=828.86s)]
*  I bet they'll say that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=830.1800000000001s)]
*  They'll tell you that. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=831.1800000000001s)]
*  And of course Israel as well increasingly has a lot of people who believe that Israel [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=832.1800000000001s)]
*  has to expand well beyond what they were intended to be because of what God promised them, the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=837.38s)]
*  covenant that God made. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=843.82s)]
*  So there's a lot of theocratic extremism that's driving a lot of countries and I do think [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=844.82s)]
*  Israel has demonstrated it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=851.42s)]
*  It's less limited by ethical, moral, and humanitarian limitations or certainly legal ones than [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=853.42s)]
*  almost any other country. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J47aLaKbM&t=859.3s)]
