# Are Neocons OUT of Power? With Curt Mills
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8)
*  Well, this week Trump gave a speech in Riyadh as part of his three nation trip, swing through [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=0.0s)]
*  the Persian Gulf that notably did not include Israel, which we'll talk about in a minute. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=13.48s)]
*  And in this foreign policy, he laid out some principles that he described as a brand new [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  way of America's, I think America's role in the world. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=24.32s)]
*  I heard a lot of this in previous speeches, including denouncing neocons and endless war. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=27.56s)]
*  That was sort of what Trump began his 2016 campaign by doing, the foreign policy orthodoxy [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=32.66s)]
*  of both parties being wildly out of whack and needing fundamental reform. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=37.28s)]
*  But this seemed to be a, I guess you could say more comprehensive and maybe more emphatic [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=44.16s)]
*  expression of this foreign policy and the fact that he chose Saudi Arabia to unveil [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=50.28s)]
*  it, I thought was notable as well. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=55.16s)]
*  What did you think of this speech in terms of whether it signals a real break from bipartisan [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  foreign policy dogma? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=62.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=63.64s)]
*  So the speech itself is interesting because so much has happened this week and obviously [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=64.64s)]
*  the sort of warp speed of the Trump presidency generally, I think, kind of got past and people [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=69.44s)]
*  pay attention the day of, but then sort of was zoomed by. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=76.0s)]
*  But I think it's notable that he even did his speech. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he could have made these maneuvers and just kind of left it up to the referees [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=81.68s)]
*  to draw a conclusion, but he went out of his way to deliver this sort of broadside, this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=87.2s)]
*  bromide against neoconservatives. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=91.72s)]
*  And this is now a talking point of the admin. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=94.08s)]
*  Now, of course, people would want to get into the definition of what a neocon is, but effectively [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  it has become, and I think an effective and accurate byword for all members of the Republican [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  Party who want to take it back to basically use Trump as a mascot to win elections, but [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=109.48s)]
*  then essentially do George W. Bush's third term. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  And so Trump explicitly castigating neocons, he's attacked endless wars in both the 16 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=118.84s)]
*  and 24 campaign most prominently. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  But to go after neocon in a foreign policy speech in Saudi Arabia was quite a move. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=126.52s)]
*  And then additionally, the term itself is becoming a key talking point of the administration [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=132.64s)]
*  itself when apparently former FBI director James Comey sort of Instagrammed an assassination [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=137.44s)]
*  threat or implication thereof. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=144.16s)]
*  One of Trump's leading spokesmen said that this was effectively motivated by Trump's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=147.2s)]
*  anti-neocon rhetoric. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=152.76s)]
*  So this is clearly a choice by the administration. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  They could have done the policy separately, but to sell it and to lay it on so clearly, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=156.72s)]
*  I think is a clear statement of where the administration has gone. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=163.48s)]
*  And also it implies a bit of a break even from where the administration was 45 days [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=166.28s)]
*  ago. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=170.28s)]
*  You know, it was a long speech. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=171.28s)]
*  There was a whole part first telling the Saudis how fantastic the president is doing to help [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=174.24s)]
*  America be strong and economically prosperous again, which I suppose is part of what he's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=180.44s)]
*  trying to pitch there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=184.94s)]
*  Like, hey, we're back. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=185.94s)]
*  We want to do business. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=186.94s)]
*  You know, that can benefit both of us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=187.94s)]
*  The foreign policy part seemed like it had different people providing different input [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=190.48s)]
*  into it because it is true that like on the one hand you had a rhetorical and quite vehement [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  repudiation of neoconservatism and the fact that, you know, he said, we've had all these [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  people who think they can nation build and they've destroyed far more nations than they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  built because they tried to interfere in countries whose complex histories and politics they [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  simply didn't understand. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=219.48s)]
*  And amen to that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  All I could do is applaud that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  But it seems like the fact that it was in these particular countries, which are not [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  really models of democracy, to put them mildly, they're some of the most savage and repressive [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=230.76s)]
*  dictatorships on the planet. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=234.14s)]
*  They're countries where Trump's family has done a lot of very lucrative business and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  continues to do a lot of lucrative business. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=241.76s)]
*  Jared Kushner got two billion dollars from the Saudi sovereign fund. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=244.12s)]
*  They've done business in the Emirates as well and are pursuing other deals. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=247.24s)]
*  I feel like this speech had a lot of that influence in the sense that I thought it catered [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  a little bit to the Saudi audience where he blamed Iran for being the root of all the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=256.56s)]
*  problems in the Middle East, which is of course a thing that the Saudis like to hear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=261.52s)]
*  They've had a longstanding rivalry with Iran. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=265.68s)]
*  Maybe it's gotten better over the last few years, but you know, it's still there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=268.54s)]
*  And I think his vision of, and you tell me if you think it's different, but I think his [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=273.2s)]
*  vision of it is like, he always says, I don't really care if countries are democratic or [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=278.88s)]
*  authoritarian. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=283.64s)]
*  I don't care if they're strong men. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=284.64s)]
*  That's kind of good. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=286.28s)]
*  That means they're tough. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=287.28s)]
*  I find that honesty very refreshing because that is what US foreign policy is thought. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=288.88s)]
*  It just always was accompanied by this deceit, this pretense that, oh, we only partner with [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=293.28s)]
*  them about democracies and we fight to extinguish authoritarianism. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=298.96s)]
*  So his vision seemed to me like, look, the model of the Middle East is what we're seeing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=302.92s)]
*  in Doha, Dubai, and Riyadh. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=307.44s)]
*  These very economically prosperous countries, they're extremely modernized. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=310.16s)]
*  I guess he believes they're trying to liberalize their politics. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=315.24s)]
*  And then essentially they're really interested in joining the world economy, exporting, as [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=319.04s)]
*  he said, technology, not terrorism. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=323.48s)]
*  And I feel like his view is basically like these three countries plus Israel form the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=326.56s)]
*  future of a peaceful, prosperous Middle East. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=331.72s)]
*  But in order to make that happen, we have to get rid of the people who want to keep [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  the Middle East at war and unstable, meaning Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iran, which [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=340.88000000000005s)]
*  you can on the one hand repudiate neoconservatism, but that is a view that neoconservatives would [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=349.44000000000005s)]
*  be more or less comfortable with. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=354.76000000000005s)]
*  So how do you reconcile all of that? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=357.56s)]
*  I think there's a lot there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=361.04s)]
*  I think that, of course, within Trump's world, there are different people who want to put [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=362.76s)]
*  their gloss on it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=367.84s)]
*  Of course, probably the most enduring legacy of Trump's first term on terms of Middle [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=369.52s)]
*  East policy is the Abraham Accords. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=374.24s)]
*  And you saw it this week. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=376.36s)]
*  Wyckoff, who I think is obviously one of the more superlative members of the administration, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=378.32s)]
*  is shopping Abraham Accord expansion. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=383.36s)]
*  But the reality is that the conditions on the ground have significantly changed from [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=388.08s)]
*  the first term. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=392.64s)]
*  So while there may be the old hymn books, the old catechisms, the religion has somewhat [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=393.64s)]
*  shifted by just changing circumstances. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  I would say, first of all, the big two, Saudi and UAE, Mohammed bin Salman and Mohammed bin [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=403.8s)]
*  Zayed, are much different players and characters vis-à-vis Trump than they were, say, eight [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=411.56s)]
*  years ago. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=417.84s)]
*  They were the driving force for hawkishness not only on Qatar, but Iran and also Yemen. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=418.84s)]
*  And you see them now being a far more pragmatic, moderate, seeking to de-escalate tensions [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=425.4s)]
*  in the region. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  The Saudis are constantly sort of under pressure to sign the Abraham Accords. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  It looks like instead it's more likely that they're going to sign an independent deal [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=438.91999999999996s)]
*  some sort of civil nuclear infrastructure with even the Iranians. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=443.56s)]
*  So a lot's changed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=451.36s)]
*  I would say that the driving force of the speech, or the subtext of the speech, the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=453.08s)]
*  driving force of Trump's trip, was a potential break with Netanyahu. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=459.24s)]
*  Netanyahu was not sufficiently on hand. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=464.56s)]
*  He was not sufficiently represented. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=467.88s)]
*  He was not on hand for these summits. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=470.44s)]
*  He was totally absent. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=472.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, the US had pulled out of major planks of his favorite policy. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=473.88s)]
*  The US unilaterally, without consulting the Israelis per all reports, got rid of the sanctions [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  on the Emiratis and the Gulf states helped wipe out their debt. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  No consultations with Jerusalem. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=487.96s)]
*  That's pretty extraordinary. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  The sanctions on Syria. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=491.52s)]
*  Sorry, I'm sorry if I misspoke. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=492.52s)]
*  And so the handshake with Ahmed al-Sharah, Netanyahu in Israel has to be asking himself [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=496.44s)]
*  whether or not he even profited from the fall of the Assad at this point, which was of course [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  the long-standing, quasi-goal of the Israelis. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=507.24s)]
*  All right, so let's tackle that for a second. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=510.28s)]
*  Actually, before I do, I want to really get into that Trump-Netanyahu rift. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=514.24s)]
*  How extensive it is, how real it is, how consequential it is. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=520.52s)]
*  And that was the perfect segue. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=524.4s)]
*  I actually have a question for you I want to ask first before we get into that, which [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=525.56s)]
*  is you made a point today, and I've heard you make it before, that a lot of people who [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=527.76s)]
*  kind of support Trump's non-interventionist foreign policy are angry about his protectionism [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=533.04s)]
*  and tariff policies at home. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=539.92s)]
*  And you made the point that you cannot extricate the two, that the vision that drives the protectionism [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=543.16s)]
*  and the tariffs is the same vision that drives his new foreign policy approach. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=550.76s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=556.84s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=557.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is a pretty important point, and one that might not make me terribly popular, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=558.84s)]
*  because I think there are a lot of people who say, oh, well, I'm in on industrial policy, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=564.52s)]
*  I'm in on tariffs, but I don't know about all of this negotiating with the Iranians [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=569.72s)]
*  business. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=574.0s)]
*  And I think there's another group that is very comfortable effectively pursuing realism [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=575.0s)]
*  and restraint, but is aghast on a lot of the elements of the White House's economic program. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=579.96s)]
*  In terms of what Trump has consistently pitched since coming down the escalator in 2015, he [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=586.08s)]
*  has portrayed a country in economic ruin and disrepair as a result of what I would call [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=592.32s)]
*  globalism, what he and his allies would call globalism, Steve Bannon, et cetera. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=600.12s)]
*  And so this might be a sort of superlative or grandiose picture, it might be an embellished [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=605.56s)]
*  picture, but it's one that very much resonates out in the public. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=621.8399999999999s)]
*  This is the key pitch in the linchpin of Republican control, that is the Midwest. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  They are saying to you, we exported all these jobs, imported all these immigrants, no discussion [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=632.24s)]
*  about that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=637.64s)]
*  And additionally, your children bore the brunt of the wars, and you got very little for it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=638.64s)]
*  And so Trump himself has always linked it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=644.8s)]
*  Witkoff, who I guess is Christian of the Ammonites Greece of the administration, has explicitly [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=648.24s)]
*  linked it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=653.4s)]
*  He has said that in the attempts to do business with the Russians and the Iranians, they found [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=654.76s)]
*  the Gulf partners a lot more acclimative, a lot more pragmatic, a lot more manageable [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=660.52s)]
*  to work with than the Europeans who of course are, they are a democracy, but they are highly [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=667.68s)]
*  ideological on foreign policy and totally adrift in recalcitrant at the moment. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=672.84s)]
*  Speaking of Bannon, one of the things that first, I don't know if I want to say attracted [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=678.0s)]
*  me but caught my attention about Trump 2016, that caused me to be more open minded to it [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=683.24s)]
*  than most people who were not explicitly MAGA got me subjected to all sorts of expulsions [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=690.06s)]
*  and labels about being a fascist, apologist or whatever. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=698.26s)]
*  But the campaign that he architected, Steve Bannon in 2016, I remember this very well [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=701.5s)]
*  because I was surprised when I heard it, was Steve Bannon's plan was, let's get in and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=706.9799999999999s)]
*  do a bipartisan infrastructure deal with the Democrats so that we spend huge amounts of [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=712.42s)]
*  money modernizing our country and putting all these people who we promised we would [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=717.26s)]
*  take care of back to work and create all these jobs. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=720.7s)]
*  Then let's raise taxes on the rich because the tax code is far too favorable to the wealthiest [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=725.54s)]
*  and then we can use that to pay for the wall. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=732.0s)]
*  Leaving the specific questions aside, it does illustrate exactly what you just said which [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=736.22s)]
*  is this kind of globalism and of course he was also promising to roll back all the foreign [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=740.74s)]
*  wars. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=747.34s)]
*  So from my perspective, you had someone saying, let's stop all these foreign interventions [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=748.34s)]
*  that have been so destructive, let's stop this endless war, let's spend money inside [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=752.58s)]
*  the United States instead to benefit the people of our country who have been so run rough [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=758.26s)]
*  shot over, let's make the tax system more equitable so that the riches are paying a [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=763.14s)]
*  more fair share to make all this possible and then let's build a wall so that the only [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=770.0799999999999s)]
*  people who can benefit from all the things we're doing are American citizens, we're [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=774.64s)]
*  not inviting other people from around the world and as you said, we're not forcing [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=778.16s)]
*  them to come because we're no longer destroying their countries. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  I thought that was an extremely interesting approach to politics, far more so than anything [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=785.92s)]
*  that was going on in the Democratic Party. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=791.56s)]
*  Remember this is 2016, you're talking about Hillary Clinton, just like the queen of establishment [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=793.16s)]
*  institutions and bipartisan dogma and then Biden, you know, Bannon gets into office along [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  with Trump and Jared Kushner and about eight months, Bannon's out. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=805.3599999999999s)]
*  I think he clearly lost a power struggle to Jared Kushner, which is probably not a good [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=809.68s)]
*  idea to go to war with the husband of the president's favorite daughter, so I guess [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=813.4399999999999s)]
*  it was kind of predictable. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  But to me that was always like a pivotal turning point in the first Trump administration. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=819.66s)]
*  I always wondered what would have happened if Steve Bannon's agenda had prevailed instead [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=825.12s)]
*  of Kushner's. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=828.64s)]
*  Now we're in the second administration, you still have Bannon kind of on the outside, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=830.16s)]
*  though he definitely seems to have a lot of influence and be looked upon favorably by [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=833.6s)]
*  at least some factions inside the White House. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=837.64s)]
*  Which of these kind of competing factions, like the non-interventionists represented [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  by Bannon, I think you could put JD Vance in there, probably Tulsi Gabbard, a couple [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=847.28s)]
*  others, Trump himself, and then on the other hand you have, you know, the standard warmongers [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=854.9200000000001s)]
*  like Marco Rubio and you had Mike Walz and now he's gone, but then you have Tom Cotton [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=857.96s)]
*  and Lindsey Graham and Republican senators. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=863.1600000000001s)]
*  Are they still at war and the outcome is uncertain or do you think one of those sides is starting [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=865.96s)]
*  to emerge more powerful? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  We'll just say two things about what you just said. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=873.84s)]
*  Number one, I think that the chronology you just provided is very useful. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=877.4s)]
*  So you know, Bannon of course had all of these ideas, infrastructures, the tax raise, etc., [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=880.76s)]
*  etc. and they pursued essentially Paul Ryan's health care plan and Paul Ryan's tax plan. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=885.68s)]
*  That's sort of the equivalent of the earlier question, why does the administration have [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=891.88s)]
*  all this sort of weird baggage where they say one thing that looks like an olive branch [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=897.52s)]
*  to realism and restraint and the other end it's a lot of the stuff from the first term. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=901.72s)]
*  I think that's sort of the explanation. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean Trump has in fact taken over the Republican Party. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=906.68s)]
*  It is a bit of a hijack job. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  He is sort of a populist centrist nationalist person. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=912.0s)]
*  He is not a neoconservative and so it's a continuously fractious marriage, one that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=915.24s)]
*  he is increasingly getting full and total control over, but it's an ongoing process. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=922.4s)]
*  As to which side is prevailing, I mean I think what is notable about this administration [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  is actually how few official hawks there are and how vulnerable someone's position becomes [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=935.2s)]
*  when they are identified as a hawk. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=943.12s)]
*  Waltz had a hawkish predegree. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=945.6s)]
*  I think he was a surprising selection for national security advisor and once he was [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=947.6s)]
*  disclosed in the press and just through his own incompetence was exposed as a sort of [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=953.08s)]
*  fanatic, he was quickly removed. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=959.12s)]
*  And he got caught by Trump plotting behind Trump's back with Netanyahu on how to attack [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=962.8s)]
*  Iran which I think might have been even the bigger cause than the signal stuff. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=967.2s)]
*  Well, I mean yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=971.28s)]
*  I think from the perspective of the sort of neocons and the hawks, consulting with the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=973.52s)]
*  Israelis behind the president's back is almost like what was so wrong with that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=977.96s)]
*  It's not even an offset question. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=984.2s)]
*  It's like a question of morality in a weird way. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=985.48s)]
*  I mean Bolton did a lot of the same stuff too. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=988.44s)]
*  He was very close with the Israelis and it's the first thing he did when he became national [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=990.88s)]
*  security advisor. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=995.96s)]
*  So, you know, Waltz probably thought he could get away with it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=996.96s)]
*  The Israelis I think have overplayed their hand and we'll see. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=999.92s)]
*  I think it is not a liability. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1003.32s)]
*  They're trying to make it so. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1006.76s)]
*  Some people and I would say the Israel lobby are trying to make it so. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1007.96s)]
*  But it is not a liability to be labeled a restrain or a realist or even a dove within [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1010.88s)]
*  the ranks. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1016.96s)]
*  There was a little bit of attacks on JD Vance during the signal gate thing for showing the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1018.0400000000001s)]
*  only version showing some hesitation about bombing the Houthis. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1023.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think you saw a lot of your usual voices being like JD Vance is attacking the president. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1026.6000000000001s)]
*  None of that stuff went anywhere. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1031.28s)]
*  The attacks on Waltz though lost him his job. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1033.4s)]
*  And I think it's pretty clear that Hegseth as well, since he has sort of sort of irrationally [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1036.8400000000001s)]
*  fumigated his top ranks at the Pentagon and is just basically running on vibes and bombing [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1042.2s)]
*  the Houthis, has lost a lot of his internet support as well and a lot of, you know, grassroots [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1048.24s)]
*  support as well. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1054.56s)]
*  So it's a strange thing where I think I don't mean to say that it's a war that's complete [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1055.56s)]
*  or going to be ended any soon, but it's kind of a guerrilla war where the establishment [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1060.1200000000001s)]
*  are now the guerrillas and trying to slip in policies there. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  And the official religion is actually now Trumpism, realism, restraint as understood [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1069.28s)]
*  within this administration. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1074.48s)]
*  If your dog is constantly itching, scratching or dealing with hot spots, and I guarantee [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1079.92s)]
*  if you have dogs at some point they are, you've got to check out Cote Defense. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1085.68s)]
*  It's an all natural solution that's been helping so many dogs. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1089.52s)]
*  And here's why this caught my attention. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1092.72s)]
*  I have a shelter that my husband and I built that has close to 150, 200 dogs. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1095.4799999999998s)]

*  but they don't actually fix the root cause. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWj9mdWyQd8&t=1121.1999999999998s)]
