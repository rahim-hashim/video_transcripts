# Gaza Death Toll Likely MUCH Higher Than Reported, Professors Warn
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs)
*  Last week on October 7th, in fact, two illuminating new studies on the US's role in the widening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=0.0s)]
*  Middle East wars were published by Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=12.0s)]
*  Affairs. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=17.34s)]
*  The first of the two detailed the genuine cost of the American expenditures directed [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=18.34s)]
*  Israel both in the past year since October 7th, but also going back to 1959 when the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=25.48s)]
*  US started sending aid to the Jewish state. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=30.36s)]
*  The second paper explores the real death toll in Gaza since October 7th, including the widespread [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=34.04s)]
*  indirect deaths of Palestinians, ranging from severe malnourishment to sweeping plagues [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=39.8s)]
*  to people undiscovered under the rubble. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=46.32s)]
*  These vivid and alarming accounts capture some of the less visible aspects of the current [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=49.22s)]
*  conflict, yet some of the most important ones, and so we're happy to welcome two of the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=53.68s)]
*  study's authors. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=57.68s)]
*  The first is William Hartung, who is a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=59.36s)]
*  Responsible Statecraft and is an expert on the arms industry and US military spending, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=64.16s)]
*  focusing on the defense budget and security assistance. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=69.64s)]
*  He previously directed the arms and security program at the Center for International Policy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=72.16s)]
*  and co-directed the Center's Sustainable Defense Task Force. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=75.84s)]
*  He's the author of Prophets of War, Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military Industrial [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=79.44s)]
*  Complex, and he joins us to discuss the report he just co-authored for Brown's Watson Institute, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  titled United States Spending on Israel's Military Operations and Related US Operations [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=89.4s)]
*  in the Region. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=94.56s)]
*  Soviet Stalmoitopoulos Robbins is an award-winning anthropologist and filmmaker with extensive [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=96.92s)]
*  fieldwork in Israel and Palestine, as well as Greece. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=102.44s)]
*  She is the author of The Waste Siege, the Life of Infrastructure in Palestine, a book [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=105.2s)]
*  that has won multiple major awards for its in-depth analysis of waste management and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=110.44s)]
*  conflict zones. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=115.4s)]
*  She holds a PhD from Columbia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  Her recent report that she published with the Brown's Watson Institute is titled The [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=119.0s)]
*  Human Toll, Indirect Deaths from the War in Gaza and in the West Bank, and we are happy [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=122.38s)]
*  to speak with her as well. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=127.44s)]
*  Good evening to both of you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=130.72s)]
*  Congratulations on these important studies and I'm looking forward to talking to both [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=132.76s)]
*  of you about them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=137.44s)]
*  Yes, thanks for having us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=138.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=140.44s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=141.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=142.44s)]
*  Happy to have you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=143.44s)]
*  So let me start with you, Mr. Hartung, because I do think there's a lot of confusion, and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=144.44s)]
*  I would suggest it's deliberate confusion, about just how much the United States supports [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=149.88s)]
*  Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=155.72s)]
*  I think it's obviously well known that we regard, or our government does, Israel as [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=156.72s)]
*  an important ally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=159.56s)]
*  We give it aid. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=160.56s)]
*  But in the last year, I think the amount of aid would surprise a lot of people if you [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=162.36s)]
*  look at the actual data and take into account all the real costs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=168.04s)]
*  So can you talk a little bit about what your study was intended to analyze beyond just [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=171.8s)]
*  the obvious transfer of money directly from Washington to Tel Aviv? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=176.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=180.72s)]
*  I mean, even that part is complicated because there's so many channels, so much attempt [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=181.72s)]
*  to hide the details. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=187.4s)]
*  The various aid channels that basically put weapons in the hands of the IDF were about [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=190.0s)]
*  $17.9 billion. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=195.36s)]
*  But then our colleague Linda Bilmuss looked at the surge of aircraft carriers, the missile [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=196.36s)]
*  war with the Houthis, increased combat pay, which added another $4 billion plus to get [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=201.64s)]
*  $22.76 billion. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=206.76s)]
*  We're pretty sure that's a conservative estimate because they've been so non-transparent about [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=210.16s)]
*  what they're sending, when they're sending it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=217.16s)]
*  They actually, Washington Post found, put a bunch of the deals under the threshold for [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=219.12s)]
*  reporting to Congress. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=224.24s)]
*  So Congress didn't know about a lot of these things when they were happening. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=225.24s)]
*  Whereas Ukraine, every time they send something, there's a long list of what it is, what it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=228.6s)]
*  costs, what weapon it was. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=232.84s)]
*  They tell you when it's delivered. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=235.0s)]
*  So it's a very different approach taken. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=236.0s)]
*  But the State Department spokesperson tried to argue we were lumping together apples and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=239.64s)]
*  oranges, which is only the case if you think the Houthis just decided to attack shipping, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=244.16s)]
*  when in fact it was a response to the war in Gaza. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=249.52s)]
*  And we didn't really get to the escalating costs of the war in Lebanon. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=253.16s)]
*  So this is the beginning. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=257.64s)]
*  I mean, even just the sending of this missile battery with 100 personnel to Israel is the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=258.64s)]
*  beginning of a further escalation of U.S. involvement. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=262.8s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what I just want to follow up on that for a minute because your study [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=266.2s)]
*  but also a lot of time before that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=272.48s)]
*  But in terms of the last year, it was really focused on the aid we gave specifically in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=274.24s)]
*  the name of the Israeli war in Gaza. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  But it seems likely, actually not even likely. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=281.48s)]
*  It's already happening that the war is already expanding and therefore U.S. involvement in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  the war is expanding. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  Hopefully it stays confined, but there's a good chance that it won't. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=290.56s)]
*  That escalation will continue. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=293.88s)]
*  What kind of cost do you think the United States might be looking at if the war continues [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=295.76s)]
*  to escalate in sort of uncontrolled way, rapid escalation in the U.S. fulfills its promise [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=300.76000000000005s)]
*  to deploy as many assets as possible to defend Israel? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, one thing that came to my mind was the war in Iraq where the Bush administration, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  one official said it would cost $50 billion and it cost a trillion. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=317.56s)]
*  So you can't predict how wars are going to go. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=323.56s)]
*  And the Biden administration's approach seems to be Israel attacks. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  There's a counterattack. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=330.16s)]
*  They go in heavier behind Israel. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=331.16s)]
*  So they're sort of like Netanyahu set the pace. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=334.56s)]
*  And once you've got troops in Israel, once you're fighting in Lebanon, once he's pushing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  the United States to perhaps bomb Iran, there's no limit to how costly this might be. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=343.6s)]
*  It's really kind of a national emergency to try to pull back the U.S. enabling of this war. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=350.12s)]
*  Let me ask Dr. Stamatopoulos-Robbins about the study that you helped to author, which [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=356.68s)]
*  is examining the real death toll in Gaza. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=364.88s)]
*  The numbers that we have been getting typically come from the Gaza Health Ministry or as the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  Western media always calls it, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=375.6s)]
*  Those numbers in the past have been very reliable and those basically count the number of people [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=380.24s)]
*  who are killed through bombing or through shelling or through some other violence from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=385.24s)]
*  war who end up in the hospital dying and then going to the morgue. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=390.4s)]
*  And those numbers have been something like 35,000 people, 38,000 people, maybe as recently [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  as 40,000. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=400.56s)]
*  Why is it necessary to do a study to determine the number of deaths beyond that? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=402.68s)]
*  What does that not include? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=407.28s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=409.28s)]
*  I think one of the most striking things about writing this report was just how much larger [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=412.68s)]
*  the number is of people who die from what is called indirect death than the number we [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=419.44s)]
*  hear about from what you're describing, which is described in the report as death from traumatic [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=425.2s)]
*  injuries, resulting from direct violence. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=431.34s)]
*  So people who work on war use ratios of roughly one direct death to four indirect deaths as [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=435.16s)]
*  the most conservative ratio for understanding the number in total that we'll find of deaths [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  once the dust has settled, so to speak, and we're able to count properly. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  But there are people who estimate that as many as 25 indirect deaths can result from [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=458.12s)]
*  one direct death. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=464.32s)]
*  So this report compiled already published data from this past year from international [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  organizations and Israeli and Palestinian organizations that collect information about [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=473.72s)]
*  different kinds of destruction to kind of map out the pathways, what they call the causal [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=479.92s)]
*  pathways to indirect death. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  So for example, economic collapse and food insecurity, the destruction of infrastructures [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=487.84s)]
*  and the medical system and environmental contamination. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=494.64s)]
*  When you put all of that destruction together, which is what the report did, you find a huge [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=500.0s)]
*  number of people that have probably already died and that will certainly continue to die, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  even if the bombs stop trapping tomorrow. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=511.84s)]
*  I think it's often kind of elusive to understand the level of destruction that has been imposed [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=515.64s)]
*  on Gaza over the last year. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  I remember very early in the days after October 7th, people who were called radicals or extremists [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=525.08s)]
*  who didn't represent the Israeli population, including people inside the United States [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=530.88s)]
*  who were attending pro-Israel protests were saying things like, our goal is to flatten [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=534.48s)]
*  Gaza, to remove it from the map and then rebuild it as part of greater Israel. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=538.76s)]
*  I remember a lot of people thought that that was quite fantastical, if not because Israel [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=543.1600000000001s)]
*  and the Israeli government wouldn't want to do it, but the international community would [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=549.32s)]
*  never permit something like that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  And yet, if you look at a lot of the data in your report in terms of the amount of civilian [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  infrastructure that has been irreparably damaged, the amount of social functioning that has [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=561.72s)]
*  been extinguished, it doesn't seem to me like we're all that far away from what those people [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  were calling for at the beginning. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=572.12s)]
*  Can you talk about some of the data that you presented in this report to illustrate the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=574.5200000000001s)]
*  scope and magnitude of what has been done to civilian society in Gaza? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=579.08s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=586.0400000000001s)]
*  So we have an estimated 90 percent of Gaza's population. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=588.0s)]
*  That's over one point nine million people who have been displaced. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=593.1600000000001s)]
*  We have 96 percent of Gaza's population facing acute levels of food insecurity. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=597.92s)]
*  I'll add to that that nine out of 10 children do not have the food they need to eat and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=604.04s)]
*  that a letter from 99 doctors to the Biden administration that was published just this [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=610.84s)]
*  month on October 2nd had an appendix revealing that 62,000 people, at least 62,000 people, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=617.52s)]
*  have already died of starvation. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=626.08s)]
*  We have the massive destruction of road infrastructures already as of January, which [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=629.4000000000001s)]
*  means people can't access health care or any kind of support system, humanitarian aid, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=636.84s)]
*  as well as I just want to make sure I'm giving you the numbers, at least three quarters of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=646.36s)]
*  housing stock that's already been destroyed, which means that people are living in [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=654.36s)]
*  temporary shelters that, as we saw today in the news, are also targets of airstrikes and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=660.64s)]
*  other forms of violence that leave people exposed to the elements as well as infection [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=668.48s)]
*  and disease. I think one of the numbers that really strikes me when I look back over this [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=674.36s)]
*  report is that of 52,000 women who were pregnant as of January, most of those women have given [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=681.56s)]
*  birth outside of medical facilities, often in tents or in shelters or even on the streets. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=689.16s)]
*  And due to the lack of medical supplies and access to health care facilities, many of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=696.88s)]
*  those women are also having cesarean sections, for example, if they do get that kind of [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  operation support without anesthesia and without disinfectants or sanitary equipment just to give you [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=709.52s)]
*  kind of a picture of what it looks like. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=717.48s)]
*  Yes, I mean, it's an absolutely repulsive and grim picture no matter what angle you look at it from. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=719.52s)]
*  Mr. Harding, I mean, one of the reasons why I found these reports so illuminating when treated as one, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=725.76s)]
*  or at least is associated together, is because there's all this destruction going on in Gaza, as was just [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=735.08s)]
*  well articulated, but then also the whole world knows that the US is paying for it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=743.0s)]
*  Now, one of the arguments that I know a lot of supporters of USAID to Israel will make is that the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  number is a little bit deceiving because a lot of that, not all of it, but a majority of the aid that we [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=754.48s)]
*  give to Israel is required to be spent purchasing weapons from the American arms industry, from [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=760.84s)]
*  Boeing or General Dynamics or Raytheon, etc. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=766.48s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=771.32s)]
*  And are there benefits to the American people from that? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=772.12s)]
*  Well, I think I'm really glad that we're discussing Sophia's paper in detail, because to me, that's the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=777.12s)]
*  foundation. I mean, for sure, more than 100,000 dead in a territory of 1.9 billion is just shocking. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  So even if there were some significant benefits to the US economy, to me that would be the equivalent of [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=789.7199999999999s)]
*  blood money. But in fact, it's much more limited than the administration would have you believe. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=796.0s)]
*  Certainly the companies do fine. About a quarter of the aid Israel can use to build up its own weapons [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=802.2399999999999s)]
*  industry. The rest of it just kind of passes through Israel, goes back to Lockheed Martin, Boeing, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=807.68s)]
*  General Dynamics, Palantir, which helps make the surveillance things to pick targets and had the gall [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  to actually hold their board meeting in Israel after the war started as an explicit political endorsement [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=820.1600000000001s)]
*  of the war. But in terms of jobs, spending on weapons is the least effective way to create jobs. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=826.6800000000001s)]
*  But it's been politically engineered. So those jobs are in the districts of members with the most power [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=834.52s)]
*  over the budget. And even relatively liberal members often don't want to be perceived as [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=840.08s)]
*  voting against jobs in their district. But interestingly, two of the unions that are most involved [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  in the arms industry, the UAW and the machinists, have initiatives underway to see if they can [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=851.28s)]
*  reduce the need for their members to build weapons to make a living, which happens periodically, but [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=856.48s)]
*  is quite extraordinary. And UAW also has come out early for a ceasefire. And so it used to be you [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=863.2s)]
*  could sort of draw a wedge between labor and peace and social justice movements. It's much less the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=872.0s)]
*  case with respect to Gaza. The paper that you looked at wasn't just about the money we've given [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=879.6s)]
*  to Israel to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=885.92s)]
*  wreak the kind of destruction Sophia was describing and that her paper so disturbingly [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=889.84s)]
*  documents, but also the kind of history of US aid to Israel. This didn't just come out of nowhere. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=896.3199999999999s)]
*  The US has been given massive amounts of aid to Israel over several decades now. Can you talk about [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=901.84s)]
*  what the trends are in terms of how much we have been giving them over the last, say, four or five [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=908.88s)]
*  decades and how much we're now giving them? Yeah, our colleague Stephen Selmer did a really great [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=915.44s)]
*  job. Among other things, he adjusted it for inflation, which is not that easy to do. But he [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=922.6400000000001s)]
*  found if you adjust for inflation since 1959, $250 billion of US military aid to Israel, which [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  not only enabled their military, but to my mind probably paid for the bulk of their own arms [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  and of course they sell light weapons, they sell drones, they become a significant weapons exporter [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=941.76s)]
*  in addition to how they use the weapons in repressing the Palestinians. So in the early [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=947.28s)]
*  decade, it was relatively low. It picked up after the 67 war and then substantially, essentially the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=953.76s)]
*  Camp David agreements were sealed with an arms deal. Egypt and Israel were allotted at least [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=961.12s)]
*  a certain amount each year. Israel's number was about 3 billion, no, it's more like 3.8, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=969.2s)]
*  counting things like missile defense. And there's a 10-year agreement, which is in the midst of 38 [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=974.72s)]
*  billion, and that's been far exceeded with these emergency aid plans in the last year. They give [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=980.6400000000001s)]
*  them used weaponry at a discount or free. There's commercial deals. They're not well reported for [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=988.0s)]
*  things like firearms. And Israel's air force that's doing the bombing is entirely made up of US [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=994.24s)]
*  weapons. So in some ways, it's like, oh, we must investigate whether US arms are involved. There's [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1002.96s)]
*  nothing to investigate. Their whole air force is from the United States. Reuters found that they [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1008.88s)]
*  had virtually used up their entire stock of major bombs and the US aid replaced that. So this war [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1013.52s)]
*  could not be waged on this scale without that support. So when administration officials say [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1023.76s)]
*  they're leaning on Israel to be more restrained or they talk about supporting a rules-based [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1029.84s)]
*  international order, it's laughable. And I don't know how these folks are ever going to have any [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1035.2s)]
*  credibility ever again. But most importantly, I think is the point Sophie is making. We have to [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1043.2s)]
*  stop the killing, and that means stopping the flow of military aid. There's some members of Congress [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1048.96s)]
*  trying to do this, but they're a relatively small core. Senator Sanders is trying to block [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1055.52s)]
*  a new arms sale. There's others. But given the scale of the suffering and the responsibility that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1060.88s)]
*  we face, it's a pretty minimal showing. People should be rising up in anger and trying to stop [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1068.8s)]
*  it. It's certainly happening with the student movement and elsewhere, but not in our Congress. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1079.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tiny, tiny group. And I question a little bit how much of that is a genuine attempt [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1084.16s)]
*  to actually stop those sales versus kind of a campaign tactic to signal to people who care [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1090.24s)]
*  most about this issue that there's space for them in the Democratic Party, even as the current [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  administration funds all of this unconditionally. Sophie, let me ask you, one of the things that I [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1099.8400000000001s)]
*  have found just beyond words over the last year is that it's not just that there's massive [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1106.16s)]
*  destruction of the civilian infrastructure and all the people who had relied on it, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1113.44s)]
*  whose lives and families depended on it. But the thing that is so striking is that basically all [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1118.0800000000002s)]
*  of the hospitals and the healthcare system has been deliberately targeted and destroyed by Israel. So [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  not only is the civilian population constantly under siege with weapons and bullets and shells, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1130.88s)]
*  but there's nowhere for them to go increasingly to even get treated. And even those hospitals that [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1136.8000000000002s)]
*  were standing from the very beginning didn't have basic supplies. Western doctors would go there [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1141.7600000000002s)]
*  and were shocked at, as you said, the lack of anesthesia or the lack of just antibiotics or the [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1147.2800000000002s)]
*  basic, most basic things you need to administer real healthcare. Even bandages have been deliberately [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1152.88s)]
*  kept out. What has been, how would you characterize the targeting and destruction of the hospital and [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1159.68s)]
*  healthcare system in Gaza and the effect that it has had on these death numbers? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's really beyond words at this point. I think some of the shocking details for [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1174.8s)]
*  me were in the weeds, like you said, kind of the lack of things like antibiotics or the inability [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1182.5600000000002s)]
*  of hospitals to provide nutrition when they are faced with severe malnutrition patients who come in. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1188.96s)]
*  Things that seem extremely basic. Another shocking thing for me in the details was that as the [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1198.64s)]
*  medical workers have been killed, we have over 880 medical workers have been killed and many [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1205.8400000000001s)]
*  thousands have been displaced. You also have a lot of people whose training in medicine has been [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1212.56s)]
*  interrupted. So you have people exercising parts of medicine that they are not trained to be in. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1218.96s)]
*  They are underfed, under slept. So we're not even only talking about the kind of physical [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1225.28s)]
*  infrastructures or supplies that are lacking, but also the kind of overall system's ability to [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1232.24s)]
*  operate in any way that would be near normal is completely gone. I don't know if I mentioned that [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1238.32s)]
*  only four of Gaza's 36 hospitals were not damaged or destroyed as of a few months ago. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1247.4399999999998s)]
*  The statistics are in the report. So it means that even the lucky people who are making it to [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1255.52s)]
*  hospitals, which again means that you're lucky in Gaza, are also being met with inadequate [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1262.08s)]
*  facilities, inadequate care, no hospital beds being available. And then as you mentioned, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1270.08s)]
*  hospitals have been actively targeted. So hospitals are bombed, hospitals are surrounded by Israeli [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1275.36s)]
*  soldiers and tanks and fired upon. So we don't have anything like a normal kind of place for [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1282.88s)]
*  people to seek medical attention. And I will add, as we're thinking about things like infectious [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1292.4s)]
*  diseases, and you may have seen that the first polio case was identified in August in Gaza, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1298.72s)]
*  and it's very possible that there are more cases, but it's been very hard to track those. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1305.2800000000002s)]
*  Today or yesterday, one of the hospitals and shelters that were bombed in Gaza, I think it [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1311.2s)]
*  was today, just in the morning, was a place where the second dose of a polio vaccine as part of the [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  broader campaign that there was a lot of media attention on was supposed to take place, but that [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1326.88s)]
*  site was targeted. So you can just see how even the kind of humanitarian high profile efforts to [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1331.28s)]
*  support the medical system are being targeted and interrupted. You've studied the Israel-Gaza [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1338.16s)]
*  conflict prior to October 7th and prior to everything that's happened. You've studied [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1348.3200000000002s)]
*  other conflicts as well. Where in the scope of, let's say, humanitarian disaster and [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1351.76s)]
*  deliberate destruction of life and civilian life, would you rank what is being done in Gaza over [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1360.3999999999999s)]
*  the last year by Israel to say prior attacks on Gaza by Israel or other conflicts in your [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1369.28s)]
*  lifetime or this century? How should people think about the perspective about how to look at what's [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1375.4399999999998s)]
*  happened there? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1382.72s)]
*  Is that a me question? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1386.52s)]
*  Yes, sorry, it is. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1387.68s)]
*  Well, I have focused primarily on Palestine in my research. So what I can say is that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1391.84s)]
*  there have been many cycles of Israeli airstrikes and other forms of violence in Gaza over the last [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1400.48s)]
*  17, 18 years. Those have resulted in high death numbers. That's what we thought at the time, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1407.92s)]
*  anyway. So sometimes numbers in the range of 1,400 or maybe up to 2,000. And here I'm talking about [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1415.92s)]
*  direct deaths from traumatic injuries with extensive destruction of apartment buildings, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1424.96s)]
*  for example, with whole apartment buildings being leveled. And at that time, each time we thought it [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1432.4s)]
*  was the most devastating kind of destruction we were seeing in Palestine and that we could imagine. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1438.4s)]
*  And I will say I did my research in the West Bank and Gaza was always during the whole time that I've [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1444.96s)]
*  been doing research, which is since 2007, kind of an extreme case we were watching. When we started [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1450.8000000000002s)]
*  to see the violence unfolding after October 7th, 2023, my colleagues and I and my interlocutors in [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1457.68s)]
*  Palestine and I were all floored. We have not seen anything like this. I don't know how to quantify [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1464.96s)]
*  to say something in a range, but just returning to the Lancet numbers, which were the conservative [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  estimate of one direct death to four indirect deaths, giving us the 186,000 number as of [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1478.0s)]
*  June of this year, we're talking about a number that we couldn't even imagine. And maybe what I [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1485.68s)]
*  should do is also go back to Palestinian history to say that in 1948, when there was the Nakba or [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  catastrophe that led to 750,000 to 800,000 Palestinians being expelled from their homes and lands, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1500.16s)]
*  that became the largest number and the kind of monumental moment in Palestinian history that [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1510.16s)]
*  people referred to as the great catastrophe. If you take the 1.9 million people who have already [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  been displaced in Gaza, you're seeing the great increase and kind of shocking development that [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1522.96s)]
*  we're having today. Yeah, when you talk about 186 deaths, direct and indirect, you're basically [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1532.16s)]
*  getting to 10% of the entire population of Gaza extinguished in the course of a year. And when you [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1536.96s)]
*  think of it that way, as well as the other ways you can think about it, the scope of it kind of [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1547.2s)]
*  becomes remarkable. Let me just ask you one last question before I turn to Bill for just a couple [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1552.4s)]
*  other questions as well. One of the things I think about often is, you said we need to stop the bombing [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1556.16s)]
*  of Gaza, which seems very obvious, but I just wonder, I think about a lot, what is the future [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1563.44s)]
*  of Gaza? I mean, there's basically no Gaza anymore. There's some people in Gaza who are in refugee tents [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1570.24s)]
*  and camps, but as far as any kind of active society or civilian life, it basically has been destroyed. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1579.1200000000001s)]
*  You have disease running rampant, as you say, and all of that's only going to get worse. This is [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1586.56s)]
*  constantly proliferating and spreading. And then there's just the mental health aspect, which no [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1592.24s)]
*  one ever thinks about when you're watching people blown up because it seems like a luxury. But to [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1597.04s)]
*  live under these conditions for a year, I don't understand how anybody goes back to any kind of [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1601.28s)]
*  normalcy ever. Do you envision how any kind of society in Gaza could be plausibly rebuilt in a [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1605.36s)]
*  way that matches what it had prior to these attacks? That's quite a question, Glenn. I'm sorry, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1614.24s)]
*  I think about it a lot, so maybe you can give me some optimism about it or not. I mean, I think [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1624.8s)]
*  about it too. I'll start with a pessimistic statistic or piece of information that came out [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1630.16s)]
*  of the report, which was that children were telling Doctors Without Borders workers that they [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1637.84s)]
*  wanted to die in the course of the last year. And we do not have suicide numbers or, of course, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1646.24s)]
*  the numbers of people who are having suicidal ideation, but the desire to stop living has been [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1654.08s)]
*  documented already in Gaza. So what you're describing as the kind of psychological effects [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1660.8s)]
*  is obviously present. The strangely optimistic, although scary kind of other piece of information [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1667.68s)]
*  to think about is that, you know, northern Gaza has been separated off from central and southern [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1676.3999999999999s)]
*  Gaza for a while now, for several months. And the people of northern Gaza, and we don't know [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1683.04s)]
*  total number, it could be 200,000, it could be 400,000 people who are living there, are under [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1690.32s)]
*  threat and under evacuation orders. Many of those people who have been under threat and under [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1697.04s)]
*  evacuation orders for months now have been refusing to leave. And I do think that we can detect in that [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1703.36s)]
*  refusal, not only an inability, which is certainly going to be the case for the disabled, the elderly [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1711.12s)]
*  people who have lack resources, but also that people are obviously attached to their lives in [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1716.56s)]
*  Gaza, whether or not those buildings are standing. So, you know, wherever the people in Gaza [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1723.44s)]
*  end up living, they are going to need support. And I think it's quite clear from the kind of [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1730.24s)]
*  messages that are being sent out from Gaza itself that people want to rebuild and are [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1739.2s)]
*  trying in small ways to rebuild their lives as best they can. They know very well that they have [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1745.28s)]
*  rebuilt before, just not on this scale. Yeah, I want to turn to Bill and just ask a couple [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1750.16s)]
*  last questions. And just by the way, we'll provide the links to each paper, which I really encourage [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1756.24s)]
*  you to take a look at and read. It's actually very user-friendly. It's not wrapped up in a lot [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  of academic jargon. There's a lot of data there that just very stark. And I really encourage you [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1766.32s)]
*  to take a look at both. This may be beyond the scope of what you're studying, like these kind of [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1772.08s)]
*  obvious costs, but also more indirect costs to the United States from the position in Israel. But [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1780.24s)]
*  one of the things that many military officials and diplomats had pointed out over the years, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1786.3999999999999s)]
*  it's now taboo. You don't hear much of this now, but you certainly will hear from it. And if you [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1790.96s)]
*  talk to policymakers in Washington, it's the understanding that the whole world knows probably [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1797.2s)]
*  the United States is probably the population that thinks about this lease. But the whole world knows [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1803.3600000000001s)]
*  that this is not an Israeli war in Gaza. This is a U.S. Israeli war in Gaza because all the weapons [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1808.72s)]
*  that fall, both in Beirut now and the West Bank and in Gaza are American weapons. America pays for [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1813.68s)]
*  it. It protects Israel at the UN. And that we have a lot of interest throughout the Middle East and [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1818.8s)]
*  throughout the world that are severely undermined because of the anger and animosity caused by the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1824.64s)]
*  world seeing what it is that we're doing with Israel and Gaza. Are you able to talk at all about [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1831.92s)]
*  the cost to the United States from that kind of failure in world standing or the damage to our [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1837.68s)]
*  other relationships and interests in that region and around the world? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1844.48s)]
*  Well, I feel like to some degree, the United States has been fortunate. It's a funny way to put it, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1848.72s)]
*  but there's been many examples of breaking international law, of causing suffering, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1856.32s)]
*  and to some degree the U.S. has restored its position not in a moral way, but because of economic [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1860.32s)]
*  power. People feel like they have to deal with the U.S. It may be different this time because of the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1866.48s)]
*  scale of the destruction. Most of the world understands what's going on here, and yet our [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1871.6s)]
*  diplomats are trying to essentially pretend that they're not enabling all this. So even in the narrow [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1877.2800000000002s)]
*  sense of the Israeli government says, well, we're going to eradicate Hamas. Well, yes, what Hamas [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1884.96s)]
*  did was horrific, but the disproportionate effects, 100 many times as people dying in Gaza has died on [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1892.0s)]
*  October 7th. And the notion that Gaza is going to disappear, even if they eliminate every last person, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1898.4s)]
*  which they're not going to do, how much resentment do they think there's going to be among this [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1903.6s)]
*  younger generation, given the destruction that's been visited on them and their families? So [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1908.32s)]
*  there's that. But then on a global scale, what does it mean every time the U.S. pushes a diplomatic [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1913.9199999999998s)]
*  initiative? I think it's hard to calculate, but I think it is different in kind, and it's going to [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1918.9599999999998s)]
*  change the whole ability of the United States to have positive influence or to redeem [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1927.52s)]
*  what it's supported here. And I would just underscore that Safiya's findings have to be [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1935.28s)]
*  broadcast far and wide because it's so much worse than a lot of people might [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1942.0s)]
*  have realized. And of course, the dying will continue even after the bombing stops because [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1947.2s)]
*  of all the trends that she's pointing out. So I think we have to stop the killing, stop the dying, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1953.92s)]
*  and I think the Palestinian people, their culture, their national identity, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1961.8400000000001s)]
*  their place in the world, of course, has to be preserved. So it's a challenging thing. And I [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1966.8000000000002s)]
*  will say that the student movement, which has taken much more pushback than when I was a student [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  activist, deserves credit for not backing down and trying to elevate this issue in the public eye. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1979.68s)]
*  But it's unfathomable and unconscionable what's going on. And we just have to redouble our efforts [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1986.88s)]
*  to stop and reverse it. Yeah, absolutely. We've had student protesters, protest leaders on the [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1993.92s)]
*  show many times talk about what really is their willingness to sacrifice potential future career [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=1998.8s)]
*  opportunities in the name of this obviously polarizing cause in the United States. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2004.8s)]
*  Let me just ask you one last question because I do think your point about the destruction of [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2009.84s)]
*  Gaza, as illustrated by Safiya's paper, is the key point. At the same time, I think it's vital [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2014.3999999999999s)]
*  in terms of incentivizing Americans to care more that they understand how much their government, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2020.72s)]
*  their own government, is behind this. This is not a conflict on the other side of the world that [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2027.68s)]
*  doesn't involve them. It's American resources, American military equipment, American service [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2030.8s)]
*  members, American money that is all behind this war, as well as our standing in the world. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2036.8799999999999s)]
*  One of the things that I find so amazing is that if you go back to the 1980s and early 1990s under [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2044.8799999999999s)]
*  the Reagan and Bush administrations, there was very much this sense that, look, we're financing your [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2052.4s)]
*  wars, you couldn't fight these wars without us, we're financing your military, and as a result, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2058.08s)]
*  there are lines that we're going to draw that you can't cross when it comes to how you're [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2061.92s)]
*  undermining our interests. The Bush 41 administration, for example, tried very hard to [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2067.36s)]
*  condition loan guarantees on the cessation of the expansion of settlements in the West Bank on the [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2072.4s)]
*  grounds that we need a Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement for our own interests. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2078.7999999999997s)]
*  There seems now to be almost no sense at all about any kind of imposition of limitations [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2083.52s)]
*  on Israel, even when they seemingly deliberately humiliate the U.S. government, as they did, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2091.52s)]
*  for example, when Joe Biden said, my red line is you can't invade Ra'a, and Netanyahu said, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2096.08s)]
*  I don't care about your red line, we're absolutely going to do what we think we need to, and then he [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2100.2400000000002s)]
*  went and did exactly what the red line that Biden proclaimed said you couldn't do, and there were [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2103.6s)]
*  zero consequences. Maybe this is also beyond the ken of your expertise, sir, but you're looking at [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2107.76s)]
*  this dynamic. Why is it that there's been, even as compared to the Reagan and Bush years, this [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2115.1200000000003s)]
*  obvious erosion in the willingness of the United States to stand up to Israel in any way, even when [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2121.36s)]
*  it comes to our own interests when it's in conflict with theirs? Well, I mean, it is [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2125.76s)]
*  extraordinary. They're not using the only leverage they have, and then they're pretending they're [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2132.2400000000002s)]
*  helpless, and I can't fully explain it in a rational sense. I mean, politically, I think they [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2136.32s)]
*  overstate, I think the staunch support for Israel is much less than it used to be, especially among [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2146.56s)]
*  the younger generation. There's some billionaires throwing money around, but I don't think that [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2152.56s)]
*  counteracts this. So I think, even if it's a narrow political calculation, I think they're [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2157.6000000000004s)]
*  operating off an old playbook. So it's almost like just an ideological hangover that's detached from [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2162.96s)]
*  reality. I really can't fathom it. I really can't. Maybe somebody else has a better way of [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2170.7200000000003s)]
*  understanding that, but nobody's benefiting from this war, and of course, Palestinians are [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2178.32s)]
*  benefiting least, but I feel like it's the 100th centennial of the birth of James Baldwin. One of [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2184.4s)]
*  the things he pointed out about structural racism is that, yes, the primary victims are the people [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2191.12s)]
*  that are being repressed, but it also deforms and dehumanizes the oppressor. And so in that sense, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2198.72s)]
*  there's no way to justify this. There's no benefits to be had, and I think anybody who thinks otherwise [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2207.8399999999997s)]
*  is out of touch with reality. Yeah, I mean, even just on the level of the crudest political [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2214.16s)]
*  self-interest, I mean, clearly the Kamala Harris campaign is endangered by anger over the administration [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2218.72s)]
*  support for this issue, and the refusal even to extend symbolic gestures to these voters who may [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2225.3599999999997s)]
*  not vote for them out of anger over their policy has been just remarkable. It's almost like they [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2230.64s)]
*  find the interest of Israel's wars to be even greater than their ability to win a national [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2236.9599999999996s)]
*  election that's going to take place in 27 days. It's such a bizarre dynamic. Well, thank you so [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2242.96s)]
*  much for the work you've both done. We're going to do everything we can to promote both these studies, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2248.64s)]
*  and I really appreciate each of your time to come on in and talk to us about it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2253.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was great to be able to talk about it in this detail. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2259.04s)]
*  Absolutely. Thank you guys very much. Have a good evening. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oKypLBWTzs&t=2262.0s)]
