# JD Vance "Dossier" REVEALED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20)
*  I was joking with some members of my of this program and the staff of this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=0.0s)]
*  program just before we went on about how I hope not to spend way too much time [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  delving into something that I have talked often about because I still [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=16.88s)]
*  consider it to be such an extreme and yet overlooked outrage which is the way [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=20.88s)]
*  in which big tech companies for the first time in an unprecedented way [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=26.32s)]
*  directly interfered in our presidential election in 2020 by deciding to censor [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=29.76s)]
*  the New York Post reporting about the Biden family's activities business [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=34.36s)]
*  activities in pursuit of profits both in China and Ukraine by claiming falsely [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=38.44s)]
*  that the documents from Hunter Biden's laptop on which that reporting was based [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=43.56s)]
*  were documents that were hacked by a foreign power and therefore violated the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=47.44s)]
*  platforms ban on linking to or discussing any hacked documents from a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=51.8s)]
*  foreign government of course we now know that that was all a lie the documents [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=57.72s)]
*  were not hacked let alone by Russia they were made available when Hunter Biden [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=60.68s)]
*  left his laptop at a repair store in Rhode Island that then turned it over [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=65.32s)]
*  and it's made its way to the hands of Rudy Giuliani as well as the FBI and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  that's what enabled that reporting but what ended up happening was the New York [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=72.84s)]
*  Post had their account locked all the way up until the election practically so [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  that they could no longer promote that reporting they were told they could get [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=81.48s)]
*  their account back only on the condition that they took down those tweets [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=85.44s)]
*  promoting the reporting that was banned and they refused to do so on principle [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  and also for days on Twitter it was impossible to even post a link you would [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  try and post a link and post it it would say this link is too dangerous to post [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=98.0s)]
*  and Facebook through a DNC operative a lifelong DNC operative announced that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=101.04s)]
*  they were quote algorithmically suppressing any discussion of that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  reporting and did throw all the way through to the 2020 election so for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=108.44s)]
*  obvious reasons when earlier today X decided to suspend the account of the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=116.0s)]
*  journalist Ken Klippenstein who as I said worked at my was my colleague for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=123.64s)]
*  several years at the intercept and then left the intercept where he now publishes [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  on sub stack he's an outstanding reporter an investigative journalist and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=131.48s)]
*  he got a hold of this document that has been called the Vance dossier in order to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=135.36s)]
*  make it seem like it contains all sorts of deep secrets kind of like the steel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=141.12s)]
*  dossier I did when in reality it's basically just a vetting document that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  was compiled by the Trump campaign about all the people they were considering as [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  potential vice presidential running mate for Donald Trump including JD Vance and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  all it does is sort of just lists all of the pros and cons the pluses and minuses [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=157.24s)]
*  the areas where he'd probably be attacked if he's the one who they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=162.2s)]
*  decided to choose as his vice presidential enemy almost entirely based [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=166.32s)]
*  on statements he's made in public going back many years statements he's made [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  about Trump about Democrats about policy along with a couple of sections of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=174.16s)]
*  information not very probing or incriminating information about his [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=179.56s)]
*  businesses his finances mostly based again on public documents or on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=184.32s)]
*  documents easily obtained through various databases that you can pay for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=188.44s)]
*  and it's long been known that these this report has been in the hands of media [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=191.96s)]
*  outlets and these media outlets claimed and so did the US government that the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=197.44s)]
*  way these media outlets got this report about JD Vance was because Iran hacked [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=202.56s)]
*  into the Trump campaign and was able to extract this document and gave it to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=208.24s)]
*  media outlets just like they claimed in 2020 or rather in 2016 that the Russians [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=212.24s)]
*  hacked into the DNC and possessed emails and that was how they got how [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=217.0s)]
*  Wikileaks got those materials that then journalists as they should have began [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=221.52s)]
*  reporting on and these media outlets people obviously knew that they had them [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=224.96s)]
*  a lot of journalists don't keep secrets and talk and so they were asked why [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=230.4s)]
*  aren't you publishing this dossier and JD Vance that you've gotten why are you [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=234.28s)]
*  withholding it and they would say well in part it's because we changed our [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=239.28s)]
*  rules in 2020 in response to liberal demands and liberal grievances that we [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=242.36s)]
*  should no longer publish information right before an election if it's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=248.24s)]
*  obtained through a foreign hacker and obviously the liberals wanted that news [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  that that that principle of journalism changed from what it had been for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=256.24s)]
*  decades which is we don't care where documents come from we don't care what [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=261.8s)]
*  the sources we don't care what the sources motives are as long as the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  documents are authentic and in the public interest we publish this has been [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=268.92s)]
*  foundational to journalism for decades but because they wanted to protect the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=272.0s)]
*  Democratic Party from any further possible hacks of documents by the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=277.04s)]
*  Russians they changed the rules by which journalism has operated for so long to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=280.88s)]
*  say from now on right before an election we're not going to publish documents [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=285.32s)]
*  that we get by virtue of a foreign government hacking and trying to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=288.2s)]
*  interfere in the outcome of our elections and so they kind of screwed [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=291.88s)]
*  themselves in the sense that they announced this rule that was obviously [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=295.72s)]
*  designed to protect Democrats but then once they announced it they obviously [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=298.48s)]
*  couldn't then go publish documents that they that the government says came from [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  Iranian hackers not even our media could be that blatant in violating their own [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=305.88s)]
*  announced policy four years earlier the real reason they didn't publish it [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  though the other reason that they gave is the real reason they didn't publish it [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=317.56s)]
*  which is basically that it doesn't contain anything incriminating about JD [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  Vance at all I can essentially guarantee you even though it's a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=323.68s)]
*  counterfactual that had these media outlets gotten documents about the Trump [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=328.56s)]
*  campaign or from the Trump campaign that came from Iranian hackers or [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=334.24s)]
*  Venezuelan hackers or Palestinian hackers or whoever doesn't like Donald [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=338.52s)]
*  Trump and it actually contained incriminating evidence about Donald [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=341.88s)]
*  Trump or JD Vance you can guarantee I can guarantee that they would have [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=345.04s)]
*  published those documents so fast it would have made your head spin but here [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=349.36s)]
*  this Vance dossier is extremely benign actually parts of it are flattering to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=353.64s)]
*  JD Vance and so these journalists got to pretend oh we changed our policy in 2020 [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=357.36s)]
*  we're gonna stick by it whether it's Trump or Biden that it helps or Trump [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=362.32s)]
*  and Harris or the Democrats that it helps but in reality they got to get up on [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  their high horse because publishing this document wouldn't have hurt JD Vance at [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  all as we now know because this document made its way to Ken [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=373.68s)]
*  Klippenstein and his colleague the national security journalist Bill Arkin [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  and they have published it earlier today on their sub stack and we can now read [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=381.76s)]
*  through it and we're gonna show you parts of it including the parts that are [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=386.32s)]
*  flattering to JD Vance the parts that are clearly just a compilation of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=389.92s)]
*  publicly available documents no one so far having read this dossier claims that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  there's anything in here that harms JD Vance or reflects poorly on him that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=400.12s)]
*  wasn't already known and yet despite that soon as Ken Klippenstein published [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=403.6s)]
*  a link saying hello Twitter I got my hands on this Vance dossier and we have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  now published it X immediately jumped in and blocked any of those links and then [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=412.32s)]
*  also suspended Ken Klippenstein the journalist who promoted it and published [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=419.56s)]
*  it there you see from the verge earlier today just summarizing in their headline [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=424.12s)]
*  what happened from 26 Xbox though any links to hack JD Vance dossier and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=427.24s)]
*  suspends the journalist who published it now when this happened a lot of people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=432.8s)]
*  including myself presumed at first glance that it seemed very similar to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=437.6s)]
*  what happened in 2020 when material that was published by the New York Post that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=443.56s)]
*  reflected poorly on the Biden family and the Joe Biden campaign was blocked in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=448.44s)]
*  the same way by Twitter the pre Elon Musk Twitter they banned any attempt to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=455.32s)]
*  post those links they locked the account of the New York Post the journalists [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=460.24s)]
*  that published it and it seemed like oh wow Elon Musk and X is now censoring a [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=463.0s)]
*  journalist in the same way that pre Twitter pre Elon Musk Twitter did back [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=468.32s)]
*  in 2020 although this time to help Donald Trump that was the widespread [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=472.52s)]
*  perception that a lot of people had that this was a sense an act of censorship [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=475.8s)]
*  political censorship by X to protect JD Vance but within and in fact if you try [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=479.8s)]
*  to find Ken Klippenstein's original tweet linking to his sub stack where you can [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=488.2s)]
*  find the JD Vance article even if you link the exact even if you search for [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  the exact link where that report is found it'll come up as no results at all [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  on X for that link that link is banned now as people started objecting and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=504.68s)]
*  saying what happened to Elon Musk I thought you believe in free speech it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  here you are punishing a journalist silencing a journalist for having [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=514.92s)]
*  published secret material about JD Vance the candidate vice presidential [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=519.0s)]
*  candidate running with the presidential candidate Donald Trump whom you support [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  and are trying to help win but turned out there was another side of this story [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=527.52s)]
*  and it was expressed by the safety division of X itself and they very [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=532.12s)]
*  transparently explained why in their view they censored or suspended Ken [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=537.72s)]
*  Klippenstein's account they said the following quote Ken Klippenstein was [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=542.32s)]
*  temporarily suspended for violating our rules on posting unredacted private [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=545.32s)]
*  personal information specifically senator Vance's physical address and the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=550.76s)]

*  was basically the result of documents that were hacked by the Iranian [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=668.0s)]
*  government and I have the same reaction to this claim as I had from a similar [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=671.24s)]

*  hear just the CIA claiming that or media outlets saying they suspect that there's [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=683.2s)]
*  a big difference as well between say a hacker who is Iranian whether inside Iran [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=690.4s)]
*  or outside of Iran and the Iranian government doing this just like there's a [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=694.84s)]
*  difference between Russian hackers and Vladimir Putin personally ordering it I [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=701.04s)]
*  mean if there were an American hacker that hacked into Vladimir Putin's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=703.8399999999999s)]

*  there's no real proof that this is the Iranians or the Iranian government that [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=713.7199999999999s)]

*  asserting it we should need evidence but anyway as Klippenstein said that was [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=721.4s)]
*  part of the reason why media outlets said they're not publishing it because [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=726.0799999999999s)]
*  they changed their policy in 2020 to say we're not publishing any documents [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=729.28s)]
*  that come from a foreign government even if the documents are true and authentic [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=733.6s)]
*  even if they shed light on a major political candidate like JD Vance. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=736.36s)]
*  The real reason though is that this dossier has nothing in it of news of real of real [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=741.8399999999999s)]

*  of a foreign malign influence campaign Klippenstein justifying his decision to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=750.24s)]

*  decided to publish it because it's of keen public interest in an election [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=757.36s)]
*  season it's a 271 page research paper that the Trump campaign prepared to vet [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=761.52s)]
*  now vice presidential candidate JD Vance as far as I can tell it hasn't been [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=766.88s)]
*  altered but even if it was its contents are publicly verifiable I'll let it [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=770.8000000000001s)]

*  JD Vance has indicated he supports unions and their priorities over that [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1300.26s)]
*  of American businesses meaning he thinks the working class and workers should have [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1307.4199999999998s)]

*  BlackRock owning everything all at the expense of American workers and that's [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1362.5s)]
*  what this dossier largely reveals but as you can say it's entirely based on just [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1368.26s)]
*  publicly available records about what JD Vance has long thought now this is the [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1373.22s)]
*  very first page of the report and right here it has JD Vance's security number [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1380.3s)]
*  and we redacted that security number but in the document that Ken [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1388.66s)]
*  Klippenstein uploaded it had the first five digits visible of JD Vance's social [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1392.98s)]
*  security number and the last four digits were X'd out but they weren't [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1401.1s)]
*  X'd out by Ken Klippenstein they were X'd out in the original excuse me in the [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1406.26s)]
*  in the original they was X'd out in the original report so it gave five of the [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1416.02s)]
*  first numbers of JD Vance's nine digits social security numbers so a majority of [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1422.34s)]
*  numbers and that was part of what X cited as why this document shouldn't be [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1426.9s)]
*  linked to and why it was doxxing of JD Vance but the much more I think [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1431.26s)]
*  substantive argument and commonly cited argument was here you see his home [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1436.0600000000002s)]
*  address and the address that's listed here and again this group these green [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1439.9s)]
*  redactions are ours there were no redactions in the report that Ken [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1444.66s)]
*  Klippenstein uploaded this report contains right this section right here [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1448.38s)]
*  has the actual home address of where JD Vance and his family live their [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1453.22s)]
*  principal residence in Ohio obviously JD Vance being a senator spends a lot of [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1458.54s)]
*  time in Washington but his wife lives and works in Ohio their children live in [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1462.6200000000001s)]
*  Ohio they go to school in Ohio and this report disclosed the exact address where [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1471.54s)]
*  that home was and then there's an additional property I believe this is [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1476.82s)]
*  the one that JD Vance has where he lives when he's in Washington in Arlington [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1480.7s)]
*  Virginia we also blocked that out but there wasn't blocked out in the [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1484.7s)]
*  reporting now the argument from X was we don't care that the JD Vance dossier [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1487.78s)]
*  was disclosed we only care that his security was endangered by virtue of [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1492.8600000000001s)]
*  publication of this very personal information that was not ever redacted [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1499.3s)]
*  and could make people know where he lives and be put in harm's way now if I [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1504.26s)]
*  were publishing a document like this and how I got this dossier and JD Vance [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1509.98s)]
*  my guess is I would have published it I mean it was a document compiled by the [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1515.94s)]
*  Trump campaign it is about JD Vance it has factual information in it it was [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1519.54s)]
*  part of what went into the decision-making process of the Trump [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1524.78s)]
*  campaign so even though there's nothing particularly newsworthy in here I think [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1527.22s)]
*  it's a document that the public should see that media outlets shouldn't hide [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1530.74s)]
*  but I most definitely would have redacted any of this kind of personal [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1534.14s)]
*  information if for no other reason that it has no journalistic value there's no [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1539.1s)]
*  journalistic value to knowing the street address of JD Vance there's obviously [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1542.4599999999998s)]
*  potential harm that could come although I think far less than a lot of people [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1546.8999999999999s)]
*  have been making that out to be for reasons I'll explain in a second but I [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1550.02s)]
*  think the act of publishing it was perfectly fine in fact a good thing and [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1553.4199999999998s)]

*  contained this information that for whatever reasons was not redacted before [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1572.18s)]
*  it went up I I don't know what this is why there's a an ad for filet mignon but [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1576.06s)]
*  apparently that was in the report now I want to get to the question of what [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1588.18s)]
*  doxing really is because I've been accused of doxing people before in ways [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1592.78s)]

*  Google and enter JD Vance's house and it will all come up I personally would not [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1619.7s)]
*  have published it simply because there's no value to it and the few the more [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1625.58s)]
*  number of people who see it the the more risk there might be but it wasn't like [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=1628.98s)]

*  official and vice presidential candidate but the information is readily available [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2028.6999999999998s)]

*  make a mistake and not redacting the quote private information of JD Vance if [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2054.66s)]

*  like myself who are air very much on the far end of the side of information [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2093.6200000000003s)]

*  value to publishing the address like oh JD Vance claims he lives in this state [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2112.5s)]
*  but in actuality here's his real house that would be a harder decision but here [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2117.06s)]
*  there's just no value journalistically and publishing the address so why do it [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2121.2599999999998s)]
*  even given the small chance that someone who might not have gotten it previously [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2125.7799999999997s)]

*  exaggeration now just to underscore why I think there's been a lot of hysteria [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2133.7799999999997s)]
*  over this idea that somehow Ken Clippenstein put JD Vance's life at risk [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2138.74s)]
*  or his family's life at risk there is all kinds of places as I said online [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2144.62s)]

*  right here's here's one of the videos that was played by a local Fox affiliate [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2174.7s)]
*  about where JD Vance lives oh this is actually this is found on YouTube by a [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2179.1s)]
*  real estate channel that's very popular you can find it easily on YouTube and it [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2186.1s)]
*  JD Vance decided to live in Virginia seems to love the neighborhoods he lives [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2191.38s)]
*  in anyways from the elegant farmhouse in Delray with its custom features to his [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2196.6600000000003s)]

*  that this is some kind of dangerous doxing I think is something that has [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2242.9s)]

*  media outlets won't publish or kind of painted themselves into a corner about [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2289.2599999999998s)]

*  from the CIA that didn't really surprise me that wasn't really out of the [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2346.54s)]
*  ordinary but one of the things they did in the lead up to the 2020 election did [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2349.86s)]
*  actually amaze me because it's it's such a radical violation of the most [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2352.6600000000003s)]
*  foundational principles of journalism what they said was we're not going to [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2358.54s)]
*  repeat the mistakes of 2016 and when they said the mistakes of 2016 was they [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2364.94s)]
*  meant was that time they did journalism when WikiLeaks began publishing all of [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2371.7s)]
*  his emails from the John Podesta email inbox and the DNC email inbox and began [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2378.62s)]
*  analyzing what it showed about Hillary Clinton and what they were saying in [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2383.46s)]
*  private it showed things like how the DNC was cheated overtly to ensure [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2386.46s)]
*  Hillary won over Bernie it forced the resignation of the top five officials of [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2391.54s)]
*  the DNC including the DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz right before [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2396.1s)]
*  their convention was obviously in the public interest to know about what [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2399.82s)]
*  Hillary Clinton a person who very well might have become president in just a [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2404.58s)]
*  few months was doing that space of journalism of course if you get a big [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2408.66s)]
*  archive in your hands of emails and other documents that you can authenticate [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2410.98s)]
*  that are about Hillary Clinton or any president or candidate of course you [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2416.54s)]
*  report on them and that's what WikiLeaks did they published them and then media [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2419.38s)]
*  outlets including the intercept including myself and lots of others [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2424.54s)]
*  reported on them and I think a lot of them doing that did so only because they [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2427.7400000000002s)]
*  never expected Hillary to lose they assumed Hillary would win and that was [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2431.62s)]
*  why they felt comfortable doing it and then when Hillary lost and Trump won all [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2434.86s)]
*  these liberals inside these media outlets were horrified at the idea that [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2440.42s)]
*  they may have played some role in helping Hillary lose by doing what by [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2443.46s)]
*  doing their job as journalists by reporting the profession that they [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2450.1s)]
*  decided they wanted to enter journalism requires them to report relevant [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2452.58s)]
*  information about any candidate even if they want them to win and that's what [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2455.94s)]
*  they did and then afterwards they regretted it I've talked before about [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2460.1800000000003s)]
*  that night when Trump won in 2016 and not only was there crying inside the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2464.06s)]
*  intercept slack channel which as probably you know is a it's a platform [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2471.9s)]
*  that a lot of companies media outlets but a lot of others too as well used [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2478.18s)]
*  because people these days are spread all over the place physically it's a place [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2482.46s)]
*  where you virtually meet people are crying journalists inside the intercept [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2485.42s)]
*  that night and also what they were saying was we need to apologize and [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2490.02s)]
*  some of us were like for what I would be apologized well what did we do wrong [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2493.74s)]
*  and they said we reported way too much on these emails this was misogynistic [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2498.8999999999996s)]
*  anyway that so that was the climate going on in 2016 oh we made a mistake by [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2504.54s)]
*  doing journalism we played a big role in helping Trump win and then in 2020 as [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2509.62s)]
*  2020 person said we're not gonna make that mistake again that mistake of doing [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2513.7799999999997s)]
*  journalism and that was when they all announced many of them did at least that [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2517.14s)]
*  from now on they're gonna abandon the long-standing rule that we publish [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2521.3s)]
*  information as long as it's authentic and reveal something about a powerful [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2524.78s)]
*  figure and we're gonna take into account whether it came from a foreign [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2528.2200000000003s)]
*  government that with the intent to manipulate the election and if it does [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2532.34s)]
*  there's a good presumption against publishing it and they again did that [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2535.26s)]
*  because they wanted to protect Democrats from some hack that came from Russia or [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2539.9s)]
*  that they were gonna say came from Russia like the hundred Biden reporting [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2543.98s)]
*  and now they've created a rule that basically is preventing them from [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2547.66s)]
*  publishing information about Trump on the grounds that it came from the Iranian [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2553.8199999999997s)]
*  government though like I said they would jettison that rule in a second if this [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2558.14s)]
*  were actually significant [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ3RUzA_M20&t=2561.7799999999997s)]
