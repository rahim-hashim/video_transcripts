# Trump Admin's WAR with Harvard
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4)
*  All right, Friday night is for our interaction with our locals members, but also in front [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=0.0s)]
*  of our entire Rumble audience. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=12.52s)]
*  The reason we do that, as I've said before, is I think interaction with your audience [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=15.08s)]
*  is of the most, most importance. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=17.8s)]
*  I have always hated the model of journalism. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=19.52s)]
*  That's monologue inform, where some journalist just sits on a mountaintop and bequeaths to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=21.2s)]
*  people the truth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  I think it's very important to hear critiques and questions and interact. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  We do that throughout the week on Locals. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=31.72s)]
*  But Friday night is the time when we take questions from our locals members. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=33.96s)]
*  So let's get into them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=38.0s)]
*  We have a lot of good ones tonight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=39.0s)]
*  I want to try and get to as many as possible. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=40.0s)]
*  The first one is from Christina K., who says, quote, I would love to hear your thoughts [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  on the cancellation of the International Student Visa Program at Harvard University. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=48.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=52.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=53.68s)]
*  I talked a little bit with Lee about this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=55.36s)]
*  And he said something I completely agree with, which is I never thought I would be defending [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=57.12s)]
*  Harvard in my life, especially over the last, say, 10 years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=60.44s)]
*  Harvard really has become a place which is almost ground zero for censoring speech that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=66.36s)]
*  it's dislike. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=75.32s)]
*  It's often ideologically homogenous. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=76.32s)]
*  It's become just this kind of closed circle, a very kind of specific, idiosyncratic, academic-ish, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=79.04s)]
*  left-wing, culture war homogeny. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=85.84s)]
*  And there's a lot wrong with academia in general. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=92.4s)]
*  All that said, I find academia to be extremely important. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=99.92s)]
*  I think it's a vital part of society. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=104.48s)]
*  If you go back to the Enlightenment, which I regard as the founding principles of Western [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=108.55999999999999s)]
*  civilization, at least in the modern era, in terms of our political values and the like, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=112.96s)]
*  every one of those Enlightenment thinkers, or the leading ones, were academics often. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  They talked frequently about the need to have at least one place in society where everything [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=123.36s)]
*  is up for grabs in terms of what you can debate, what you can challenge. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=129.24s)]
*  There are no taboos. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=132.12s)]
*  There are no pieties. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=133.12s)]
*  I think having an institution in society like that, where everything is studied, everything [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=136.12s)]
*  is questioned, everything is poked at, is vital. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=141.04s)]
*  And I like going to college. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=146.84s)]
*  I like going to law school. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=148.12s)]
*  And that was a big part of my experience. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=149.12s)]
*  I was able to do that all the time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=150.92s)]
*  I found it so refreshing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=152.76s)]
*  It helped me learn a lot. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=154.76s)]
*  It really stimulated my interest intellectually that there were all sorts of things out there [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=155.76s)]
*  that had been about questioning these long-term pieties. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=160.04s)]
*  And you could, essentially, you were free to express the things that you wanted to express. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=165.68s)]
*  And I think it is quite disappointing, quite harmful, quite tragic that in so many ways [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=170.88s)]
*  our universities have become these ideologically homogenized outposts of political activism [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  at the expense of what should be this academic freedom. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=183.56s)]
*  Nonetheless, it really is true that one of the things that has been most responsible [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=186.52s)]
*  for America's success economically, technologically, politically, socially, militarily has been [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=191.8s)]
*  research that takes place at our highest institutions. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  Everywhere in the world, people look at Harvard and talk about Harvard with great admiration [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=204.72s)]
*  and awe. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  Here in Brazil, if somebody went to go and study at Harvard even for a year and they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  come back and they say, oh, I studied at Harvard, it imparts them with immense credibility. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's how it's looked at around the world. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=221.28s)]
*  Harvard is one of the symbols of American greatness. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=223.4s)]
*  It's been a college, a leading college for 500 years now, 450 years, and the same of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=226.52s)]
*  Yale and Brown and Princeton. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=234.88s)]
*  But Harvard, especially globally, is at the top. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=236.84s)]
*  And so I think if you're going to have a government that suddenly decides that it's going to wage [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=241.6s)]
*  a major war to try and destroy what have always been America's leading academic institutions, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=245.0s)]
*  it's kind of out of the blue, just started attacking it in every conceivable way. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=252.11999999999998s)]
*  I think everybody should be very guarded about why that's happening. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=257.2s)]
*  In general, academic institutions, the leading ones, and the government have had extremely [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=260.88s)]
*  close partnerships. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=265.52s)]
*  The reason the federal government gives money to places like Harvard and Yale and all sorts [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  of other schools is not because the government is being benevolent, it's not because the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  government wants it to have a nice gender studies program. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=277.08s)]
*  Sometimes it's to fortify financial aid so that not only rich people from rich families [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=281.56s)]
*  can go to the top schools, but mostly it's for paying for research projects that the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=285.96s)]
*  United States government once undertaken. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=290.4s)]
*  It was federal-funded research programs at our universities that led to the invention [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=294.2s)]
*  of the internet in the United States and American dominance over the internet for all those [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=301.64s)]
*  years that came right out of federal funding of academic institutions. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  Cures and medical treatments, scientific advances, technological advances that often were things [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  the government wanted done for military use. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=319.08s)]
*  When you have well-funded research programs, that's how you attract the greatest minds [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  from all around the world and that only fortifies the institution. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=326.52s)]
*  Without these research facilities, it basically just becomes like a liberal arts school for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=330.88s)]
*  18-year-olds and 19-year-olds as opposed to institutions where the highest level research [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=336.32s)]
*  and innovations take place. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=344.48s)]
*  On top of that, it's the question of why are these institutions being attacked? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=348.36s)]
*  In the case of Harvard and Columbia and Yale and Brown and Princeton and all the others [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=353.08s)]
*  that the Trump administration has targeted, there's been one argument that I think is [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=357.64s)]
*  a valid one, which is that there has been this discrimination in the admissions process [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=364.28s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=368.68s)]
*  It was considered affirmative action where you would purposely go out of your way to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=369.68s)]
*  divide all the applicants into groups of race to ensure that there was a representative [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  from each group and part of that was to correct historical injustices. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=382.96s)]
*  Other parts of it was to have a more diverse campus. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=387.56s)]
*  I think there was a time when you could make that argument if that was necessary and over [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  time we've gotten to the point where we've decided that that's no longer necessary, that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=396.32s)]
*  it's actually a form of racism in its own way. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=400.68s)]
*  Courts have stepped in and begun to rule against those sorts of practices and they've had to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=404.4s)]
*  scale back greatly on them. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=411.32s)]
*  So I understand that objection, but the much bigger reason, as we know, is that these schools [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=414.68s)]
*  allowed protests against Israel to take place. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=422.32s)]
*  For many years, you can go back to 2010, 2012, 2014, all these groups that are funded by [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel or Israeli loyal billionaires were obsessed with American college campuses because [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  they knew that that's where the primary activism against Israel was. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=438.76s)]
*  Based on this boycott, divestment, and sanctions model that helped bring down the apartheid [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  regime in South Africa, Israel and its loyalists were petrified that that would work in American [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=447.0s)]
*  campuses and they knew a lot of the anti-Israel sentiment was being talked about and allowed [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=452.0s)]
*  on American campuses and they set out this whole anti-woke thing. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=458.72s)]
*  If you go and look at it, all these people who were obsessed with Israel, who led this [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=462.88s)]
*  anti-woke movement on college campuses, were doing it in part because they hated American [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=466.76000000000005s)]
*  colleges because it allowed too much Israel criticism. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  And the Trump administration is saying that, that you have allowed too much anti-Semitism, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  meaning Israel criticism, on your campus. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=479.68s)]
*  They're actually forcing institutions to put their Middle East studies program under receivership [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=482.8s)]
*  so the government can control what is taught in Middle East studies programs. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=489.56s)]
*  Who thought that the role of the US government was to control the curricula of how adult [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=494.16s)]
*  academics who teach adult students can do their curriculum, can pick their course materials? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=502.16s)]
*  But that's what the Trump administration is doing and it's all because of Israel. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=511.0s)]
*  To some extent it's because they perceive it's kind of a left-wing institution, they [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=513.8000000000001s)]
*  want to attack it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=517.24s)]
*  They've already denied funding to these schools here from AP. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=518.6s)]
*  On April 15th, Trump administration freezes $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard due to campus [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=525.44s)]
*  activism. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=531.72s)]
*  And we know what that means, campus activism means the Israel protests that you allowed. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=532.72s)]
*  And then when Harvard, unlike Columbia and other universities that accepted all these [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=536.76s)]
*  extremes or crony and controls by the government, yes, you can control our curriculum, you can [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=541.32s)]
*  supervise our hiring and our admissions process. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=546.28s)]
*  And Harvard said, look, you've gone too far, we made a lot of concessions, but we're about [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=548.52s)]
*  to become a branch of the Trump administration if we go too far and we're going to sue instead. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=552.64s)]
*  And they sued, that's when the government went ballistic. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=557.04s)]
*  And today Homeland Security announced that they were canceling the student visas of all [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=561.0s)]
*  Harvard students, revoking them immediately, and would refuse to give student visas for [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=565.52s)]
*  any international students that want to go to Harvard in the future. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=570.82s)]
*  Certainly 25% of Harvard has international students. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=574.72s)]
*  It's a way that, you know, the United States spreads pro-American sentiment. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=578.84s)]
*  People want to come to the United States, they want to study in the United States, they [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=584.5400000000001s)]
*  get integrated into American culture. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=587.6s)]
*  It has great benefits for the United States. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  As I said, people look at Harvard as this place that everyone around the world wants [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  to go to. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=595.48s)]
*  Or Yale or Princeton or Columbia, Stanford, whatever. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=597.28s)]
*  And we're waiting for one of our most valuable and credible institutions despite all the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=604.7s)]
*  flaws that I know it has. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=612.1400000000001s)]
*  And we're doing it not because we think that the schools aren't doing their job, we're [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=615.1400000000001s)]
*  doing it because they allow too much criticism of Israel. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=619.1800000000001s)]
*  And the idea that Harvard, of all places, its current president is Jewish, most of its [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=622.4200000000001s)]
*  past presidents are close to a majority, if not an overall majority over the last 30 years [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=628.5400000000001s)]
*  Larry Summers has been Jewish, Larry Summers is one of the people who ran Harvard for the longest. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=633.86s)]
*  Their biggest donors are overwhelmingly Jewish. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=639.86s)]
*  Jews do very, very well at Harvard. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=646.86s)]
*  The idea that it's some kind of cesspool of anti-Semitism is laughable. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=649.78s)]
*  But as we know, any criticism of Israel is now deemed anti-Semitic and that's what's [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=655.78s)]
*  driving the Trump administration. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=659.06s)]
*  And so now you take these huge numbers of foreign students who have spent years pursuing [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=660.62s)]
*  PhD programs, a lot of them are going to graduate and stay in the United States and become extremely [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=666.5s)]
*  productive members of American society. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=670.94s)]
*  And even if they don't, even if they go back to their countries, they're obviously going [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=673.62s)]
*  to have a connection to the United States. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=677.3s)]
*  And now you take all these people who have put years and years into their studies and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=681.1s)]
*  out of nowhere they're instantly told your visa is revoked. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=684.18s)]
*  And you can try and get into another school, we'll extend your visa then, but if you don't, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=687.62s)]
*  Harvard doesn't have any more student visas. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=691.86s)]
*  We're revoking them all and we're banning Harvard from accepting any foreign students [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=694.82s)]
*  in the future. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=698.62s)]
*  And this is basically on the verge of destroying Harvard, notwithstanding their $50 billion [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=699.62s)]
*  dollar endowment. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=702.86s)]
*  And as Lee said, this $50 billion dollar endowment almost makes them like a hedge fund. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=707.7s)]
*  So I don't have sympathy for Harvard, but it is true that denying them all federal money [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=712.34s)]
*  destroying and forcing them to dismantle all research programs and then allowing, disallowing [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=717.62s)]
*  any student, international students will absolutely cripple this institution that has for 500 [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=722.14s)]
*  years been the pinnacle of American greatness and a symbol of it and a crucial tool in soft power. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=729.1s)]
*  And it's just yet another way that this government got into power and decided that one of its [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=736.5400000000001s)]
*  goals, if not its number one goal, was to punish anybody who was criticizing Israel. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=740.6600000000001s)]
*  I think it's incredibly dangerous. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=745.74s)]
*  What we've done is we've basically turned the United States into a country where a requirement [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=749.06s)]
*  to enter, to study or to work is that you love Israel and worship Israel or that you [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=755.3s)]
*  at least agree that you'll refrain from ever criticizing it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=759.1s)]
*  And we're just sacrificing so much of our national interest for this foreign country. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbL0ih4dPK4&t=763.3399999999999s)]
