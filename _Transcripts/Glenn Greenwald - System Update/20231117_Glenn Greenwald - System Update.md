# On Israel-Gaza & the Corrupting Media Dynamic of “Audience Capture” | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE)
*  Just want to spend a little bit of time talking about our audience reaction to the now almost [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=0.0s)]
*  six weeks of coverage we have devoted to the Israeli-Gaza war. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=12.08s)]
*  As many of you know, we have this live after show every Tuesday and Thursday night. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=17.48s)]
*  Tonight's Thursday we're going to go do it, where once we're done with this show, I sit [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=22.12s)]
*  in our studio and I take questions and respond to feedback from our subscribers to the locals [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=28.04s)]
*  community. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=34.04s)]
*  I think it's $5 a month, $7 a month, something like that to subscribe. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=35.04s)]
*  A lot of people were with me at Substack who are subscribers who have renewed their subscription. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=38.48s)]
*  And the purpose of that live after show is for me to be held responsible to my audience [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=44.44s)]
*  by hearing criticisms of the things I'm saying and have to interact and respond. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=49.56s)]
*  Obviously we knew early on that a good chunk of our audience was going to be supportive [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=55.28s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=61.2s)]
*  That was something of which I was very well aware. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=62.2s)]
*  But I also have a long history as an American Jew, as an American, of being very critical [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=65.4s)]
*  of the Israeli denial of Palestinian statehood, of the illegal occupation of the West Bank, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=72.54s)]
*  of the blockade of Gaza, of the frequent bombing by the Israelis, of the US support for all [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=78.0s)]
*  of those Israeli wars. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=84.8s)]
*  These are ideas I have been defending and advocating for a long time and I knew once [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=85.8s)]
*  that Hamas attack happened that was so horrific that it was going to provoke exactly what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=91.88s)]
*  it has, a really unprecedented kind of war in terms of watching a trapped, helpless population, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=96.32s)]
*  50% of whom are children, relentlessly be bombed and killed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=106.96s)]
*  Around every 200 people in Gaza have been killed in the last five weeks and we're nowhere [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  near the end of this war. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  And so I was faced with this dynamic which is I knew that by expressing my views of this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=119.8s)]
*  war, by covering it in a way to try and show people things that I thought they weren't [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  going to see from other places, that we were going to end up alienating a significant part [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=130.96s)]
*  of our audience that isn't just pro-Israel but that supports Israel vehemently as a major, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=135.44s)]
*  issue for reasons we've covered. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=141.4s)]
*  And obviously I didn't have a choice if I had even for one second given thought to the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  possibility that I should avoid this topic or just cover it quickly and then run away [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=151.08s)]
*  from it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  I've seen journalists do this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  There are journalists who rely on their viewers or subscribers or their audience, loyalty, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=160.28s)]
*  who have just ran in the opposite direction from this issue knowing that it polarizes [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=166.24s)]
*  their audience. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=171.4s)]
*  I've noticed who is doing that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=173.16s)]
*  I'm not going to do that, ever. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=175.12s)]
*  And I think I've talked about before the first time I had to alienate my audience which was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=179.32s)]
*  in 2010 when I had largely a left liberal audience although I had a lot of libertarians [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  at the time too because that's who was critical of the Bush-Shandy war on terror. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  And when the Citizen United decision happened, it was a decision that enraged everybody up [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  to center from the furthest left-wing fringes to the most conservative members of the Democratic [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  Party and everything in between. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  And people started saying to me, you're a constitutional lawyer. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  You talk about free speech a lot. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  What's your opinion of Citizens United? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=213.84s)]
*  And I knew my position was the one of the ACLU, of labor unions, of free speech absolutists [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=215.8s)]
*  which is, I thought that and still think that, the specific restrictions on campaign finance [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=222.2s)]
*  spending that were struck down in Citizens United are in fact an infringement of free [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=228.44s)]
*  speech. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=234.04s)]
*  That case emerged because a nonprofit group wanted to fund and finance an anti-Hillary [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  Clinton campaign right before the election and were told they couldn't under these laws. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=242.6s)]
*  Of course to me that was an infringement of free speech and I had to write about it and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=246.56s)]
*  I wrote about why I supported the majority ruling in Citizens United. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=250.92s)]
*  And to say that my audience was angry at me was an understatement. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=253.88s)]
*  I definitely lost readers. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=256.64s)]
*  But they were a minority. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=259.8s)]
*  A lot of my readers were angry with me. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=262.16s)]
*  I kept going into the comments section and engaging with their critiques. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=263.68s)]
*  I kept writing and addressing their major arguments to explain my position over the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=266.68s)]
*  weeks. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=272.24s)]
*  And what I learned from that was that the audience I wanted was never an audience that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=274.16s)]
*  demanded me full and complete agreement but knew that there would be times because I don't [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=278.24s)]
*  plant myself in an ideological camp and refuse to serve every view of any one faction that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  there were going to be times when I disagreed with them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=291.6s)]
*  In fact, disagreed with them about issues that they felt very strongly about. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  And so my pledge to my audience, to my viewers, to my readers has always been, I'm not going [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=297.24s)]
*  to tell you what you want to hear all the time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=301.44000000000005s)]
*  But I promise instead is I'm going to give you my completely honest view, regardless [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=304.24s)]
*  of who it helps or hurts or pleases or angers. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=309.68s)]
*  And I'm going to do my best to be respectful of critiques and criticisms, trying to seek [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=312.0s)]
*  out the smartest and best ones and address them in a substantive, persuasive, well-researched, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=317.22s)]
*  fact-based way. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=322.68s)]
*  That's my promise. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=323.76s)]
*  But audience capture has become a very real thing because the way in which media has evolved, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=326.32s)]
*  it used to be even 10 years ago that you were stuck watching CNN or reading the New York [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=330.72s)]
*  Times because that's all there was. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=336.84s)]
*  But now with the internet, there's such a proliferation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=341.64s)]
*  You don't need to be a billionaire or a gigantic company to produce a show like this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=344.96s)]
*  You can have a very sophisticated studio, multiple cameras, a staff without a huge amount [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=349.6s)]
*  of money because the technology has evolved so well and you can reach a lot of people [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=356.04s)]
*  without owning a network or even cable news access. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=359.64s)]
*  And so there's a ton of choices. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=364.24s)]
*  And among those choices are always people who will tell you what you want to hear on [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=367.18s)]
*  any issue. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=370.3s)]
*  And so it's very easy to listen to somebody and say, all right, I'm done with that person. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=371.3s)]
*  I was with them as long as I agreed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=376.4s)]
*  And now they disagree, I'm gone. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=378.9s)]
*  I checked out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=380.52s)]
*  And we've heard from subscribers canceling their subscriptions because they feel so strongly [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=382.97999999999996s)]
*  about this foreign country that they don't care if they like my work on the rights of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  American citizens, my criticism of the corporate media in the United States, my criticism of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=392.86s)]
*  the US security state, my defense of free speech and civil liberties. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=397.38s)]
*  Israel is the issue that is at least as important if not more important to them and just agreeing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=401.74s)]
*  with them enrages them so much that they just can't follow me anymore. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  I've lost thousands of followers on Twitter. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=408.94s)]
*  A lot of them have been replaced. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=410.5s)]
*  So overall, it's a net gain. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=413.1s)]
*  But the majority of my audience, the majority of this audience here, including people who [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=414.97999999999996s)]
*  support Israel, including people who disagree with me about my perspective of this war, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  have not only stayed but said that they're staying. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=425.74s)]
*  But I just want to tell you that audience capture is very real. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  You feel it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=434.12s)]
*  Because the model that most media outlets now use is one that relies on subscribers [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=436.46s)]
*  or having a big enough audience for ads. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=443.26s)]
*  And either way, losing or alienating part of your audience can have a very direct impact [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=446.62s)]
*  on your ability to earn a living to support your family. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=451.14s)]
*  And I see all the time people capitulating to that pressure. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=456.38s)]
*  And I felt it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=461.86s)]
*  Not going to lie. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=463.62s)]
*  I of course knew that was a danger. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=464.62s)]
*  But there's no way I can do this work if it doesn't come from a place of passion and honesty. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=466.86s)]
*  My integrity is just not for sale. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=473.46000000000004s)]
*  I'd honestly rather lose 90% of my viewers and subscribers than have to go home at night [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=474.98s)]
*  after the show and put my hand on my pillow and know that I somehow changed my view or [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=480.14s)]
*  altered it or suppressed it or modified it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=484.66s)]
*  Not because I was changing my mind but because I just wanted to avoid alienating people in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=487.98s)]
*  my audience. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=493.5s)]
*  There's nothing worth that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=495.18s)]
*  And we did lose some people but a small percentage and I'm very thrilled to know that I have [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=497.86s)]
*  deliberately sought to attract and cultivate an audience of people who are willing to hear [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=503.26s)]
*  disagreements, who actually want to hear disagreements, who find that illuminating and stimulating. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=507.98s)]
*  I've had a lot of provisional supporters in my life, a lot of my friends, but also in [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=514.1s)]
*  my audience writing to me and saying, I still don't agree with you, I get angry sometimes, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=518.62s)]
*  but at least it makes me think. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=523.34s)]
*  It's a check on what I think and that's the same thing I feel about the pro-Israel audience, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=524.82s)]
*  pro-Israel viewers and correspondents that I hear from all the time, including on our [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=530.5s)]
*  after show. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=535.82s)]
*  It's a way of keeping each other honest. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=536.82s)]
*  And it really is true. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  There are people, shows that do very well in terms of attracting a lot of your audience [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  and making a lot of money for their hosts. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=546.7800000000001s)]
*  And they say, I'm here. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=550.38s)]
*  I'm in this part of the Republican Party. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=552.86s)]
*  I'm in this part of the Democratic Party. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=554.34s)]
*  I'm in this faction and that one. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=555.74s)]
*  Come to me and you will never hear anything that conflicts with your worldview. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=558.62s)]
*  It's a successful model. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=565.02s)]
*  But ultimately it's a model that has no nutrition. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=568.26s)]
*  It's a model that is soul draining instead of affirming and it creates nothing good. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=571.76s)]
*  I'm okay with losing 10% or 15% of our audience or our subscriber base. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=578.66s)]
*  I have no doubt that we will build that back and more. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=583.1s)]
*  It's happened many times in my career. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=587.1s)]
*  I lost 20 to 5% of my audience in 2009 when I extended my critique of the war on terror [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=590.18s)]
*  under George Bush to the identical war on terror policies of Barack Obama and a huge [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=596.7s)]
*  number of Democrats who thought I was so great. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=601.9s)]
*  Like, wait a minute. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=604.5s)]
*  I'm not here for criticism of the Democratic Party. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=606.14s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=608.22s)]
*  And then over time it built back up and exceeded that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=610.3s)]
*  But you have to be willing to take that risk and feel that pain. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=613.22s)]
*  But it's so worth it at the end and it's the only kind of journalism that matters. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=619.8199999999999s)]
*  Do not seek out and do not trust people who tell you what you want to hear all the time. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=623.76s)]
*  It is not good for you. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=628.02s)]
*  It's not good for journalism. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=630.02s)]
*  It's not good for our discourse. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIbhShtMnE&t=631.18s)]
