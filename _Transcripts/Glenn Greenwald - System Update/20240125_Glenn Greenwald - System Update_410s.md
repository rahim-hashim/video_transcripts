# Middle East War Returns? Biden Bombs Yemen, Iraq, & Syria
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A)
*  We began talking a lot about presidential powers and war powers a couple of weeks ago [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=0.0s)]
*  when the United States decided with no debate, no debate in Congress, let alone a vote in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Congress, to just start bombing Yemen as though the president could just wake up one day and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=18.0s)]
*  decide, hey, I think we should go bomb this country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=23.2s)]
*  And we urged people in our audience to think about, even if you believe that what the Houthis [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=25.5s)]
*  are doing in attacking commercial shipping of the Red Sea, in retaliation for the countries [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=31.1s)]
*  that they believe are responsible for the destruction of Yemen, even if you believe [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=37.5s)]
*  that that bombing is justified, to think about the reasons why it's so important still for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=42.0s)]
*  Joe Biden not to be able to start new wars or bomb new countries, absent emergencies [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=47.7s)]
*  that are not applicable here without first going to Congress. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=52.7s)]
*  And one of the things we warned is that this is very likely to start escalating and that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=55.1s)]
*  is exactly what happened. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=59.9s)]
*  There is not just escalation when it comes to bombing Yemen, but in the last month, Joe [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=61.2s)]
*  Biden has also bombed Syria and bombed Iraq, a constant tit for tat that is rising in seriousness [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=66.3s)]
*  with various militias affiliated with Iran. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=74.0s)]
*  One of the things we had agreed on as a nation, and Paul showed this, was we were tired of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=78.3s)]
*  Middle East wars. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=83.7s)]
*  And yet it seems as though the things that are certain in life are not just death and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=85.7s)]
*  taxes, but also that the United States ends up bombing multiple countries in the Middle [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=89.7s)]
*  East at once. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=94.4s)]
*  Here's the New York Times warning of the dangers as US and militias engage, White House worries [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=95.4s)]
*  about a tipping point. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=101.2s)]
*  Now remember, all of this is happening because of the decision of the United States to fund [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=108.7s)]
*  and support Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=115.6s)]
*  This is yet another cost of our decision to tie ourselves at the hip to Israel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=117.3s)]
*  That is what all of this is about. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=122.6s)]
*  The Yemenis were not attacking ships in the Red Sea until the Israelis were destroying [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=124.0s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=128.5s)]
*  There was most of these conflicts fully under control and they only started escalating as [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=129.7s)]
*  a result of anger and unrest in the region toward Israel that then spills over to the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=135.8s)]
*  United States because of the vital role we're playing in enabling that war. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=141.0s)]
*  The New York Times goes on, quote, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=144.3s)]
*  Again, why are there American troops in Iraq and Syria? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=165.8s)]
*  With nearly 70 US personnel wounded, some of them suffering traumatic brain injuries. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=194.3s)]
*  All but a few have been able to return to duty in short order, according to the Pentagon. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=199.10000000000002s)]
*  Here's from NPR, January 22nd, the US and UK bomb more Houthi sites in Yemen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  Quote, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=208.8s)]
*  The second time the two allies have conducted coordinated retaliatory strikes on an array [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=209.8s)]
*  of the rebels' missile launching capabilities. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  Before we get to our guest who I am very excited to talk to because he is the head of one of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=224.10000000000002s)]
*  the most important foreign policy activist groups in DC. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=228.5s)]
*  I just want to quickly show you as the setup for the interview, the exchange that happened [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  Secretary Pat Ryder at the Pentagon on January 23rd, where he was essentially asked, we're [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=236.8s)]
*  bombing all these countries, it's escalating. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=246.0s)]
*  Aren't we in a new war in the Middle East? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=249.0s)]
*  And listen to what he said. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=250.4s)]
*  The US Secretary General just now is talking about the conflict in the Middle East. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=252.0s)]
*  He's mentioning the Houthis. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  He's mentioning the US and the UK strikes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=258.7s)]
*  He's mentioning what's going on with striking in Iraq, both Israelis and the United States. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  And he's urging all parties to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous human [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=269.9s)]
*  cost of a regional conflict. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=275.4s)]
*  What's the Pentagon's response to that? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=278.0s)]
*  Well, Carla, we've been working for a very long time on regional security and stability, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  not only in the Middle East, but around the world. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=285.7s)]
*  And so we'll continue to work very closely with allies and partners globally to address [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  tensions in the Middle East. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=293.7s)]
*  You know, since Hamas's attack against Israel, of course, we've been very focused on deterrence [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  and on preventing a wider regional conflict, and we'll stay focused on that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=301.2s)]
*  What about his words on the brink? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=305.7s)]
*  Is the US on the brink of war right now in the Middle East? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  We are not at war in the Middle East. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=311.6s)]
*  Clearly, there are significant tensions in the Middle East. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  Again, we're working closely with allies and partners to de-escalate and reduce those tensions [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=316.5s)]
*  where we can, recognizing the fact that, you know, others have a vote as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=321.4s)]
*  Now, this is one of the things I've tried to explain before, that when you live outside [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=328.4s)]
*  the United States, you realize how ridiculous it is to have a government that is regularly [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=331.5s)]
*  bombing multiple countries and at the same time standing up and saying, no, we're not [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  at war. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, bombing countries is the definitive act of war, along with invading the countries [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=344.1s)]
*  with troops. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=349.3s)]
*  And yet, the United States is so constantly bombing other countries in a way that no other [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=351.1s)]
*  country gets close to, that we've had to raise the bar of what a war is so that we can constantly [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=355.3s)]
*  deny we're at war, even though for 95% of the countries on the earth, if you started bombing [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=362.0s)]
*  other countries, it would be not only an extraordinary event, but obviously it would be preposterous [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=371.5s)]
*  to stand up and saying, hey, we want you to know we're bombing this other country, but [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  we're not at war with them. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=379.5s)]
*  It's basically a self-negating concept. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpl-i8Eyo4A&t=381.0s)]
