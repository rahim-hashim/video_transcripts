# IDF Soldiers are "Hostages" but Palestinian Civilians are "Prisoners"?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw)
*  Now, I do want to return to the issue for a second of Eden Alexander because I think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=0.0s)]
*  the whole issue of these hostages, as we've been calling them, and the prisoners who are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=11.28s)]
*  in Israeli dungeons with no charges, Palestinian prisoners, is an important one to consider. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=16.6s)]
*  Here from the Times of Israel reporting on this case, quote, Eden Alexander will be the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=23.14s)]
*  first male soldier freed since October 7th. First male soldier. Quote, Alexander, a dual [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=26.4s)]
*  citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the IDF's Golanee Brigade at the time [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base near the Gaza border community of Nerem, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=39.2s)]
*  known as the White House post, during the October 7th onslaught. On October 7th, Hamas [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=45.2s)]
*  took 19 male soldiers hostage, not all of them on duty, and several female surveillance [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=50.32s)]
*  soldiers, the latter of whom have all since been returned to Israel. Five were released [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=56.28s)]
*  in a deal with Hamas. One was rescued and the body of one was recovered by troops. So, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=60.52s)]
*  I've never heard of active duty soldiers in a war who get taken and kidnapped or abducted [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=68.64s)]
*  or detained or whatever you want to call it, referred to as hostages. That's usually [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=77.44s)]
*  a legitimate conduct of war to capture the enemy soldiers and place them in some place [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=83.32s)]
*  where they can't continue to fight. Every country does that. And yet, there's never [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=91.96s)]
*  been any distinctions drawn between the IDF soldiers who were taken hostage and the civilians. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=97.4s)]
*  So, where there were civilian hostages taken and those people should never have been taken. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=103.04s)]
*  And I think it's correct to call them hostages. But not IDF soldiers. Just as there's been [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=109.12s)]
*  no attempt to distinguish between active duty military soldiers who were killed on October [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=114.72s)]
*  7th versus civilians. We kept, and you keep hearing to this day, 1200 innocents killed [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=119.2s)]
*  on October 7th when in fact, at least something like half of them, or even more than half, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=124.36s)]
*  were active duty soldiers or police officers on bases or armed agents of the state. The [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=134.12s)]
*  Times of Israel says, quote, Eden Alexander's release will mean no Gaza brigade soldiers [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=142.12s)]
*  or Golanee brigade soldiers are held in Gaza for the first time in over a decade. Now, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=146.4s)]
*  Steve Wotkoff is the one who negotiated, who led the negotiations of this. So, he was in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=154.28s)]
*  Israel and the family of Alexander came there to welcome him back. And there's video of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=158.92s)]
*  him being released. I want you to take a look at the condition in which he appears. There [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=165.96s)]
*  he is walking with IDF soldiers laughing, smiling. And there he is meeting his mother. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=171.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=178.84s)]
*  And I should say, this is not unusual for Israelis released by Hamas. They've all looked [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=194.2s)]
*  quite good, well fed. There was one group of, I think, three Israelis who were released, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=223.88s)]
*  who seemed to have been thin. That's because there's now mass starvation in Gaza. The ones [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=230.68s)]
*  who got released early all said, oh, yeah, they would, whatever food they had, they would share [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=236.6s)]
*  with us. And over time, they got concerned that these people were coming back and talking well [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=240.2s)]
*  about the conditions of their captivity. And so it got much darker as they were coached. But you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=246.84s)]
*  can just see them in these videos. I'm not saying they're doing well. Obviously, being held [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=252.68s)]
*  in captivity anywhere for a year and a half is going to be unpleasant, probably isn't good for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=258.52s)]
*  your health, especially when you're in the middle of a place that's being massively bombed by your [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  own government's military indiscriminately. You're probably constantly petrified of dying in an [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=270.76s)]
*  Israeli airstrike, as many of these people did. And obviously, the diet isn't going to be great [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=274.92s)]
*  either because they are in a place where their Israelis are blocking any food from entering. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=281.24s)]
*  But you can see, I mean, that was a healthy person you just looked at, physically, certainly. And so [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=287.8s)]
*  many of the Israeli hostages, their vast, vast majority have come back in that shape. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=293.64s)]
*  Now, you compare that to the Palestinian civilians who have been abducted from Gaza or the West Bank [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=299.72s)]
*  and detained with no charges. There's really called administrative detention. They put them [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=309.16s)]
*  in these dungeons where there's reports, widespread reports of them barely eating anything. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  A 17-year-old prisoner who was both Palestinian and Brazilian ended up just dying about a month ago. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=322.44000000000005s)]
*  And he was in a condition of starvation and vulnerable to all kinds of viruses. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  Infections, and the Brazilian government is demanding answers, but none are forthcoming. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=339.48s)]
*  17-year-old kid, totally healthy, dying in an Israeli dungeon. And again, these are not people [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=344.6s)]
*  convicted of crime. So, I mean, some of them are, but the vast majority are just picked up and held [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=351.8s)]
*  there. These are civilians. These are people not convicted of anything. And yet we call [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=356.6s)]
*  even the soldiers, the IDF soldiers in Gaza, we call them hostages. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=363.24s)]
*  And we call the civilians, the Palestinian civilians, in these hideous prisons where [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=369.16s)]
*  there's been documented rapes. Remember, members of the Knesset actually went and protested in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  favor of the soldiers who got caught on video gang raping a prisoner. And then Israeli media argued, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  no, gang raping is a legitimate weapon of war to use against Palestinians. But you compare the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  people who are coming out of Gaza, being released by Hamas to Israel, and the relatively healthy [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=392.04s)]
*  state they are in, to the utterly broken, hollowed out, emaciated, disease-ridden people, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=397.0s)]
*  Palestinians, civilians, who are turned over to Gaza as part of these deals. They barely resemble [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=405.08s)]
*  human beings. Here is a Palestinian teacher. Those barracks had forms of torture that were [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=412.68s)]
*  indescribable, indescribable, indescribable. For 45 days, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=418.84s)]
*  I was blindfolded and on my knees. And there you see pictures of his scabies, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  reddened skin. The same posture one would have praying to God Almighty, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=428.76s)]
*  blindfolded and shackled. One would sleep with shackles on your hands. After that, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  I was transported to Negev prison. In Negev prison, all kinds of tortures are there. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  Whatever form of torture you can think of is there. I told you they would use electric shocks on us. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=445.4s)]
*  Electricity was used in torture. In addition, dogs were used in torture. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=452.92s)]
*  That is all. And if you look at his face, for those of you who are listening and watching, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=460.44s)]
*  he looks like someone liberated from Auschwitz. He's somebody who is barely a person any longer. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=465.72s)]
*  He's barely a person any longer. And this is not an aberration. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=477.0s)]
*  There is no question that people in Gaza with Hamas are treated better than the people coming [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  out of these Israeli prisons who are there on no charges, no convictions. It's just a fact. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=490.52s)]
*  And there's been ample documentation. They got caught in video gang raping Palestinians, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=495.88s)]
*  including just recently. And they come out with scabies all over them, all over their skin, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=500.28s)]
*  and emaciated. Just today in the Israeli newspaper, Heretz, the writer Jonathan Pollock [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=506.76s)]
*  wrote a letter in the form of a column to an Arab friend of his named Nadal. And it says, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=515.56s)]
*  Nadal, you're dying in an Israeli prison, and I don't know how to save your life. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=523.24s)]
*  Quote, you are dying of hunger and colitis in Mekdido prison where you're held without charges [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=527.88s)]
*  or a trial. May your captor starvers be damned. That's from an Israeli Jew who is a journalist. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=533.8s)]
*  And again, there have been all kinds of independent human rights organizations that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=543.2399999999999s)]
*  have issued documented reports on the abuse and horrific torture endured by Palestinians, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=547.0799999999999s)]
*  and sometimes even death. And yet we call those prisoners, even though they're convicted of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=553.24s)]
*  nothing, but we call Israeli soldiers on active duty at military bases and in tanks who are taken [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=557.88s)]
*  by Hamas. We call those hostages, just to give you a sense for how we value the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=564.36s)]
*  humanity of one side and don't value the humanity of the other at all. It just makes no sense. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLPa3suCdXw&t=568.8399999999999s)]
