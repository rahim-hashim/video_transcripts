# INTERVIEW w/ Lowkey: Israel-Gaza War Is “Apocalyptic”
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw)
*  We are happy to welcome to our show the British rapper and political activist and analyst [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=0.0s)]
*  and commentator, Loki, who as I said at the top of the show has really become one of the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=12.4s)]
*  most influential voices when it comes to Israel and the Palestinian conflict and in particular [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=16.8s)]
*  the war in Gaza. He has a large audience that follows him and listens to him and that's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=23.4s)]
*  for good reason. He's very effective in his analysis and we've been hoping to get him [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=30.56s)]
*  on the show for a while and we are happy to have him here. Loki, welcome to the show. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=33.56s)]
*  It's great to see you. Thanks for coming on. Thanks so much for having me, Glenn. I really [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=38.2s)]
*  appreciate it. Absolutely. So let me begin with this. We know we've had a lot of critics [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=43.92s)]
*  of the Israeli war in Gaza on our show. We've had debates on this. We've had Israeli supporters. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=50.199999999999996s)]
*  My view is very clear to my audience, my critiques of this war. So before we get into that, which [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=56.48s)]
*  I think my audience is kind of familiar with, let me ask you, we're currently going on the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=62.44s)]
*  third month of this war. There are 16,000 people in Gaza who have been killed by the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=67.92s)]
*  Israelis. That's probably a conservative number. Generally there are people buried [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  underneath the rubble who aren't included in that count. The U.S. government has said [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=78.24s)]
*  those numbers are, if anything, undercounts. Just today there was a resolution that the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  U.N. Security Council voted on to call for a ceasefire between the Gazans and the Israelis. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  And 13 of the 15 countries voted for it. One country, the U.K., abstained, but the United [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  States voted against it. So the United States is protecting Israel at the U.N. as it always [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  does. It's feeding the Israelis the weapons it's using to bomb. Do you have any meaningful [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=104.56s)]
*  hope that anything or anyone will be able to stop the Israelis any time soon in what [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=112.0s)]
*  they're doing? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, to start with, Glenn, I just wanted to deal very quickly with some of the issues [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=120.08s)]
*  you were just discussing. Now, TikTok has also banned the account of the website that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=127.88s)]
*  I work for, Mintpress. It's important to note that the content policy lead for TikTok Canada [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=135.0s)]
*  is Alexander Corbeil, who is also simultaneously the vice president of the NATO Association [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=141.76s)]
*  of Canada. What you also have in addition to that was I discovered that the feature [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=148.4s)]
*  policy manager for TikTok is Greg Anderson. Now, Greg Anderson formerly worked in psychological [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=155.24s)]
*  operations for NATO. Now, when I discovered that and published that information some time [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=162.8s)]
*  back, Greg Anderson actually edited his LinkedIn profile to delete the psychological operations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=168.32s)]
*  aspect of his work at NATO. We also know that Bo Patterson works as a threat analyst for [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=174.34s)]
*  TikTok's trust and safety division. Well, Patterson was previously a targeting analyst [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=182.1s)]
*  for the CIA. You also have the example of Victoria McCullough, who worked for the Department [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=189.58s)]
*  of Homeland Security and the White House itself and now currently works at trust and safety [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=196.1s)]
*  at TikTok. So what we're talking about with TikTok, and you can look up the work by Alan [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=204.38s)]
*  McLeod on the Mintpress website, the NATO to TikTok pipeline, is very important for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=210.54s)]
*  people to understand the process that has played out at that company. There's many [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=217.14s)]
*  who have come from being employed at the CIA and NATO to being employed in very sensitive [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=223.5s)]
*  positions in TikTok. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  No, I think I know, Obe, just interject there before you go on, because I do want to just [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=231.7s)]
*  add to that, which we did a show, as I said, confronting this moronic idea that TikTok [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=236.42s)]
*  is this arm of the CCP and that it's being used to propagandize the American public on [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  behalf of China. And we've also done shows before showing how many people from the US [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=247.98s)]
*  security state are placed into the censorship units of big tech platforms. In fact, Facebook's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=253.42s)]
*  primary censorship official is a long time operative of the CIA. He was at the CIA for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=259.9s)]
*  20 years and now he runs Facebook's censorship. And I think some people think TikTok is immune [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=265.5s)]
*  from this because they're Chinese. But the reality is they've had the same infiltration. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  TikTok has been on this hiring spree, in fact, from Facebook, from Google, to get all these [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=275.38s)]
*  US security state operatives on board to their content moderation staff to show the Pentagon [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  and the CIA and the Biden White House that they're on board with whatever censorship the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  United States government wants as a condition to sing in the United States, because what [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=288.9s)]
*  they really care about is the profit. These are capitalists who are trying to make money [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  from the US market. So I think it's an extremely good point. I'm glad you detailed that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=296.5s)]
*  All right, go ahead and unless you have more to say on that, go ahead and address the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=300.82s)]
*  question about this war and how it might at some point come to an end. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, Israel has the stated objective of driving the two million population, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=311.98s)]
*  2.3 million population of Gaza into the Sinai desert. It seems that the United States, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=319.06s)]
*  while supplying supposedly, according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, over 200 planes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=326.86s)]
*  of weaponry throughout this war. We also know that the British are involved in logistics. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=334.06s)]
*  Some of the flights of US weapons have gone from British base, British base in Cyprus. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=340.5s)]
*  We also know that Britain is intercepting communications of the resistance forces from [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=347.38s)]
*  its base in Cyprus. The NSA is there also and sharing that information on a daily basis [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=353.5s)]
*  with Israel. There has from time to time been one or two points that the US has pushed back [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=358.86s)]
*  on. So, for instance, when Israel cut off communications in Gaza, apparently it was [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=364.3s)]
*  due to some form of US intervention that communications were then returned to Gaza. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  But ultimately, the US has given Israel a blank check to do whatever it wants to this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=376.02s)]
*  population. One could wonder whether this war will turn into the regional war that it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=381.9s)]
*  seems Israel wants. It seems to want to knock out Hezbollah in Lebanon and then possibly [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=389.58s)]
*  try and push the US into going for a final regime change showdown with Iran. But it seems [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  that while they may be able to achieve the movement of a large number of people out of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=405.14s)]
*  Gaza into the Sinai desert, it seems the Egyptian government are giving indications that they [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=410.7s)]
*  will agree after being given promises to forgive debt and whatnot. The wider regional war [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  hopefully can be pushed back on. We need China and Russia to take more forthright positions [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=423.53999999999996s)]
*  to Israel in a more effective way. The question is, where are the red lines? The United States [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=431.22s)]
*  gives Israel normally about $10.4 million of military aid on a daily basis. But where [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  we are now, it's obviously increased massively. Israel is believed to have carried out assassinations [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=445.82000000000005s)]
*  in 18 different sovereign states around the world. We really have to question at this [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=451.42s)]
*  point, does what we understand to be the international community even view the Palestinians [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=456.2s)]
*  as human beings? This is just an unconscionable level of human suffering that has been unleashed [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=463.2s)]
*  on Gaza. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=471.0s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit more about the Israeli goal because you said the stated goal [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=472.0s)]
*  was to drive the Gazans into the Sinai. There have been military documents that have discussed [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=477.88s)]
*  this. This is the open policy of the Netanyahu government that Gaza and the West Bank, which [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  they now call Judea and Samaria, that Ron DeSantis is now calling that in order to indicate [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=489.12s)]
*  that all of this land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea belongs to Israel, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=494.6s)]
*  that it's all part of greater Israel. Obviously, if it has to be part of greater Israel, it [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=500.0s)]
*  means Israel needs to take full control of it all and drive the Palestinians out. The [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=503.32s)]
*  stated goal of this operation from the start has been to destroy Hamas. In terms of that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  stated goal, I'm having a hard time understanding what that would even mean because it reminds [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=517.92s)]
*  me a lot of after 9-11, the United States obviously had a great quest and thirst for [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=526.48s)]
*  vengeance. There were Americans who just wanted to see the Middle East, parts of the Middle [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=530.8s)]
*  East being blown up, parts wanting to see Muslims and Arabs dying because that's who [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=534.88s)]
*  they perceived as having attacked the United States on 9-11. Part of that mission was really [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  ill-defined. It was just pure bloodthirst. Obviously, that's part of what's going on [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=545.24s)]
*  in Israel. One of the things the United States found, and the United States government will [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=550.76s)]
*  tell you this and has said it, is that the more you kill people in a region, the more [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=555.08s)]
*  you bomb them, the more terrorists you're creating. Obviously, the more people standing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=558.72s)]
*  by watching the United States killing people, the more people want to come and kill the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=562.6s)]
*  United States and kill Americans. What do you think is going on in the mind of Gazans, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=565.32s)]
*  the mind of people in the West Bank, the minds of the people in this region as they watch [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=573.52s)]
*  every day these hundreds of Gazans being blown up and killed and babies being killed by these [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=578.4200000000001s)]
*  extraordinary numbers? What is this going to look like for Israel when they ever do [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=586.0s)]
*  end up? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=591.0s)]
*  Well, this apocalyptic war is something that has many people in the region are left with [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=592.52s)]
*  a deep scar on their psyche from viewing these images. Of course, the war on terror era, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=603.36s)]
*  which entailed the dropping of 46 bombs per day by the U.S. and allies for 20 years straight, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=611.32s)]
*  on average 46 bombs per day, the invasion of numerous countries and the displacing of [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=619.2800000000001s)]
*  over 30 million people. We have always understood that the ideals which the United States professes [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  to hold are actually false and have no real truth to them. But unfortunately, the worry [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=635.2800000000001s)]
*  is that you have had this in Nour and Masalha in the fantastic book, The Expulsion of the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=642.64s)]
*  Palestinians, goes into detail about the trajectory of the Zionist movement from Zionist thinkers [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=649.64s)]
*  like Theodor Herzl to Chaim Weizmann. The idea of population transfer has always been [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=656.88s)]
*  there. And as you say, if Israel is to establish its complete control over the world, then [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=662.88s)]
*  it's complete control over Gaza and push the Palestinians out into Egypt and try and then [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=670.12s)]
*  distribute them around the world, without a doubt there will be sustained resistance [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=676.88s)]
*  from many different quarters. The Israeli Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Education [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=683.8s)]
*  have for some years been funding organizations who also have the stated objective of replacing [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=690.08s)]
*  al-Aqsa with a temple which some believe to have existed around 2000 years ago. Now, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwsJOYAQ1rw&t=696.12s)]
