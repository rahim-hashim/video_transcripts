# "Liberation Day," End Times, & Inaugural Ball Hopping With Michael Tracey
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA)
*  All right, everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=0.0s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  It's me, your old friend, Michael Tracy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  That's a name. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=14.88s)]
*  We are at what I'm told, or what was alleged to be, without my having verified it, the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=16.02s)]
*  of the inaugural balls held by a state society. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=24.0s)]
*  So it turns out that of all the states in the union, you know what's perhaps the most [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=30.12s)]
*  hospitable? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=34.68s)]
*  That would be the Commonwealth, not the state, technically, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=35.68s)]
*  And in Kentucky, they produce a lot of bourbon. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=43.36s)]
*  So we are at the Bluegrass Ball here in Washington, D.C., a couple days before the official inauguration [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=47.48s)]
*  of one Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=55.0s)]
*  You may have heard of him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=57.16s)]
*  And we are helping ourselves, at least I am, not the camera woman. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  She doesn't drink two, some Kentucky bourbon, which, and this was also said in some of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=64.52s)]
*  remarks before, might not be fully true, but it sounds true. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=73.44s)]
*  So I would answer this on jeopardy, that bourbon is the only native spirit, not a metaphysical [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=77.0s)]
*  spirit, we're talking about an alcoholic spirit, only native spirit in the United States. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=84.36s)]
*  So they celebrated as their beloved homegrown industry. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=90.16s)]
*  They were just railing against the depredations of prohibition. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=97.32s)]
*  There's a bunch of dignitaries and whomever here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=104.08s)]
*  We saw Rand Paul milling around. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=108.16s)]
*  I saw Hal Rogers, who is the congressman, who is the dean of the House of Representatives [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=111.28s)]
*  at this point, there for like 45 years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=116.28s)]
*  Andy Barr, who once told us that America first means Israel first. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=120.72s)]
*  We'll leave that aside for now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=124.8s)]
*  Tonight's date is September 18th. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=126.6s)]
*  Celebrate bourbon, celebrate truth and justice and liberty. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=128.64s)]
*  And yeah, we're going to be covering all kinds of stuff associated with the inauguration. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=132.48s)]
*  Maybe we'll chat with some people here if we're not thrown out by the PR woman who's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=138.32s)]
*  been trailing us. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  And that'll do it for now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=144.92s)]
*  So hail bourbon, hail Trump. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=147.2s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=152.48s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=154.48s)]
*  Inauguration weekend. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  The spirits are flowing literally and figuratively. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=158.11999999999998s)]
*  And we are here at yet another event. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=162.12s)]
*  This one's a little bit more off the beaten path. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=165.44s)]
*  It is, I guess what you might call one of the very few, if only, if possibly only opposition [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=167.6s)]
*  style balls. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=178.32s)]
*  This is called a Peace Ball. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=180.96s)]
*  I don't know what that really means exactly, because we're told that there are like a bunch [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=184.56s)]
*  of Democratic members of Congress here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=188.96s)]
*  It's basically supposed to be the progressive alternative ball, whatever that may mean. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=191.56s)]
*  So probably the only event we're going to be going to over the course of these next [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=199.84s)]
*  couple of days that is not overtly pro-Trump, maybe more Trump neutral, flash hostile. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=202.68s)]
*  And so this is where they all convene at some theater in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  Like Voices of Justice and Liberation is on the program. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=215.88s)]
*  So kind of standard progressive, pop-lum, I have to say. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=219.0s)]
*  But there are people of note here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=225.96s)]
*  The camera woman just asked, yeah, you can come in if you want. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=230.28s)]
*  Come in. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=232.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=233.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=234.32s)]
*  We just asked the random guy if he wanted to come in the video. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=235.32s)]
*  He said no, who we were trying to earlier. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=237.16s)]
*  There are other people here like Max Blumenthal is here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=238.55999999999997s)]
*  Aaron Montes here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  And we'll try to keep an eye out, I guess, on anything of note. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=246.0s)]
*  There's like strange, you know, authentic music being performed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  Other than that, really not a whole lot to report as of yet. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=254.6s)]
*  But as always, we will keep our eyes peeled for your viewing pleasure. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=258.68s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=264.32s)]
*  We are marching. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=266.92s)]
*  We are marching. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=269.92s)]
*  We are marching in the light of the. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=271.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=291.92s)]
*  The swearing in has taken place. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=292.92s)]
*  We are somewhere in the vicinity of the Capital One arena where they brought [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=294.92s)]
*  the parade or are bringing the parade indoors to. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=300.92s)]
*  And as you can see, much of the the waiting area here lies in ruins. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=307.92s)]
*  So we'll we'll figure out if we can get any proximity to it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=315.92s)]
*  I am not sure. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=320.92s)]
*  But I thought I'd just give you a nice little tour here of the exterior. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=322.92s)]
*  Look at all these gates and perimeters and. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=327.92s)]
*  It's just a beautiful sight. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=331.92s)]
*  So let's walk a little bit and see if we encounter anything noteworthy. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=333.92s)]
*  It's just, you know, if you ever been to an inauguration before, they're kind of. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=343.92s)]
*  They're always an organizational challenge to navigate, it seems. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=347.92s)]
*  So I'm not even sure what's going on over here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=351.92s)]
*  Here's some sort of mountain of. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=364.92s)]
*  Bags and. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=367.92s)]
*  What is that about? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=370.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=373.92s)]
*  Yesterday I was in there and I was able to get in with my little bag. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=374.92s)]
*  OK, so people had to abandon their bags. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=377.92s)]
*  I think you could take what's inside of them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=381.92s)]
*  It looks like I mean, I would get if I had a bag like that, which I this I would I would [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=383.92s)]
*  get rid of this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=389.92s)]
*  I would get rid of it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=390.92s)]
*  Yeah, I would. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=391.92s)]
*  I really like because people come to these things with shit bags. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=393.92s)]
*  You see these plastic bags that's like $15 a bag. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=396.92s)]
*  And then the stuff you bring with it, as long as you have your ID, your phone, your [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=400.92s)]
*  wallet, your keys, you could just throw that away. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=404.92s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=407.92s)]
*  That's that's like the mindset. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=408.92s)]
*  Now, if you bring a Gucci bag, you're screwed. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=410.92s)]
*  I don't like throw that away, which I don't think anybody is going to bring a Gucci bag [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=414.92s)]
*  to this place. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=419.92s)]
*  But you see all the shit that's on the floor. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=420.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=422.92s)]
*  I bet if you search, I bet if you search through some of these, you might find a decent bag. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=423.92s)]
*  I don't really see anything that it's just all cheap leather to me. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=427.92s)]
*  I like all of this is just crap. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=431.92s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=434.92s)]
*  Trump did them a favor. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=435.92s)]
*  Make America clean again. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=436.92s)]
*  In your own homes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=438.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=440.92s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=441.92s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=442.92s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=443.92s)]
*  That was a nice lesson. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=447.92s)]
*  She was describing these piles of shit bags. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=450.92s)]
*  She was describing these piles of discarded items. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=454.92s)]
*  I'm leaving the hood on. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=462.92s)]
*  I'm because you know what? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=465.92s)]
*  It's Liberation Day and I'm really taking that to heart. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=467.92s)]
*  As Donald J. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=472.92s)]
*  Trump said in his inaugural address today, America has been liberated. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=473.92s)]
*  So I feel that entitles me to wear my hood, especially on as frigid a day as today, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=477.92s)]
*  despite how people might not see that comporting with their view of decorum. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=483.92s)]
*  So the the the merch is just endless. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=493.92s)]
*  It will never end. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=497.92s)]
*  How the salesman, sir? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=499.92s)]
*  How salesman? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=506.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=509.92s)]
*  He doesn't want to be interviewed. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=510.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=514.9200000000001s)]
*  I guess. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=515.9200000000001s)]
*  Look at the back of a shirt. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  It says, bitch, I'm the president. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  So what books are these? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  The Great Controversy. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  What's the Great Controversy? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  It's a book about U.S. history and prophecy being fulfilled. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=537.92s)]
*  Oh, and what is the prophecy? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=541.92s)]
*  Well, there's multiple different prophecies, specifically. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=545.92s)]
*  I don't know if you're familiar with a lot of the prophecies in the Bible. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=550.92s)]
*  I'm familiar with quite a few. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=553.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=555.92s)]
*  Well, I don't know if you've heard of the twenty three hundred day prophecy. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=556.92s)]
*  Would that be associated with the end times scenario? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=561.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=566.92s)]
*  So obviously, a lot of things have been predicted in the Bible. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=567.92s)]
*  We see them happening all around us. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=571.92s)]
*  We're just trying to spread the word about that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=574.92s)]
*  So do you believe that we're on the cusp of the end of days? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=576.92s)]
*  I think so. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=581.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think Jesus is getting ready to return. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=582.92s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump is anything to do with that? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=585.92s)]
*  Or is it just coincidence that you're here on Inauguration Day? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=587.92s)]
*  We're here to hand out books. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=590.92s)]
*  There's a lot of people, obviously. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=592.92s)]
*  But also, I think everything has a purpose and Donald Trump could be one of them. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=594.92s)]
*  What do you think is his role in the fulfillment of the prophecy? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=599.92s)]
*  Well, obviously, he's a leader of our country. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=604.92s)]
*  And with him leading our country, he's going to be making a lot of decisions that could impact our futures. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=608.92s)]
*  And obviously, God has a lot of control over that stuff. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=614.92s)]
*  And I think he'll be using them, him to fulfill his work. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=617.92s)]
*  All right, where are you guys from? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=622.92s)]
*  I'm from Pennsylvania, originally from Virginia, though. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=624.92s)]
*  We've got people all over the place. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=627.92s)]
*  Where's your church located? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=629.92s)]
*  We're actually working out of the old school. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=631.92s)]
*  Usually, a lot of different churches have come together to help spread books. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=634.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=637.92s)]
*  I'll do a reading of it on camera maybe later. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=638.92s)]
*  All right, thank you. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=644.92s)]
*  You know, those people always seem to believe the end of days is near. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=653.92s)]
*  And the lack of apocalypse never seems to dissuade them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=658.92s)]
*  So we'll see. Maybe this time they're right. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=662.92s)]
*  For those of you who enjoy people watching, no better time than today. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=666.92s)]
*  We got one. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=673.92s)]
*  Who's funding these books, I wonder? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=677.92s)]
*  I should ask them. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=680.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=682.92s)]
*  So is this pro or anti-Trump? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=688.92s)]
*  Or neither? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=690.92s)]
*  That's pro-Trump. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=691.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=692.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You want anti? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=693.92s)]
*  No. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=694.92s)]
*  What, you? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=695.92s)]
*  It's just... [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=697.92s)]
*  Go camera, camera. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=698.92s)]
*  It's just such a grotesque depiction of Trump that you might think that it's... [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=701.92s)]
*  You know, it's not like Chuck E. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=705.92s)]
*  Chuck E. got it, yeah. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=707.92s)]
*  Charlie Trump. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=709.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=710.92s)]
*  There you go. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=711.92s)]
*  But isn't Chuck E. bad? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=712.92s)]
*  Chuck E. is like that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=714.92s)]
*  Isn't he like a murderer? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=715.92s)]
*  Look, yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=716.92s)]
*  We can make this all about him. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=718.92s)]
*  This is what's going on in my brain 24-7. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=721.92s)]
*  Let me see your shirts here. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=724.92s)]
*  They're eating the dogs. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=727.92s)]
*  They're eating the cats. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=730.92s)]
*  They're eating the cats. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=732.92s)]
*  The people that live there. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=733.92s)]
*  There may be other things. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=735.92s)]
*  And that's what they say. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=736.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=737.92s)]
*  One dollar Trump pin, guys. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=739.92s)]
*  One dollar. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=741.92s)]
*  Joe, Kevin, you're out. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=742.92s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=744.92s)]
*  Take it out the trash. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=745.92s)]
*  Greenland was my favorite country. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=747.92s)]
*  I just learned about it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=749.92s)]
*  What country? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=751.92s)]
*  Greenland. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=752.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=753.92s)]
*  I just learned about Greenland. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=754.92s)]

*  I love it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=757.92s)]
*  We will conquer Canada. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=758.92s)]
*  Canada. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=760.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=761.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=762.92s)]
*  Don't let this trick out. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=763.92s)]
*  We love it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=764.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=765.92s)]
*  Just a barrel of laughs. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=766.92s)]
*  We should get that for Glenn, actually. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=771.92s)]
*  He could put it on his desk. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=772.92s)]
*  He should put that on his desk. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=773.92s)]

*  We're together with us and we fight. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=790.92s)]

*  God bless. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=796.92s)]

*  Trump, God bless America. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=802.92s)]
*  Do you think that Trump is inspired by God? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=803.92s)]
*  We're just here to support Trump, to support America, freedom of America. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=807.92s)]

*  It's blowing in the wind right now. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=823.92s)]
*  Thank you, God, for giving the United States a new president. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=828.92s)]
*  I think that's pretty self-explanatory. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=845.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=847.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=848.92s)]
*  Self-explanatory. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=849.92s)]
*  You think God delivered Trump or he empowered Trump to become president again? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=850.92s)]
*  Yes, I think so. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=861.92s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent, yes. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=862.92s)]

*  It's a good song. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=898.92s)]
*  Come on. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0PnTZc-jIA&t=899.92s)]
