# Trump Admin Group Chat Plotting War Plans LEAKED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw)
*  Earlier today, the longtime editor in chief of The Atlantic, which has been one of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=0.0s)]
*  most anti-Trump magazines in the country, it was ground zero for some of the most deranged [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=13.5s)]
*  Russiagate hysteria, it was Jeffrey Goldberg who, during the 2020 election, claimed anonymously [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=19.06s)]
*  that Trump had disparaged the soldiers who died fighting as losers and suckers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=28.22s)]
*  And then in this election, he was the one who kept quoting General Milley and others [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=35.14s)]
*  claiming and General Kelly claiming that Trump had said he admired Hitler and was a fascist. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  One of the most unscrupulous operatives in DC over the last 20 to 25 years, as well as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=45.86s)]
*  one of the most vociferously anti-Trump ones. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=53.42s)]
*  He wrote an article earlier today in The Atlantic, which by the way is owned by the billionaire [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=57.24s)]
*  Heiress, Lorene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, who inherited his billions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=61.72s)]
*  She became a major donor to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and she runs this magazine where [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  he works. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=73.4s)]
*  And here you see the headline of his article, The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  Me Its War Plans. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=81.08s)]
*  And here's what he writes, quote, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=83.52s)]
*  The world found out shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time on March 15th that the United [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=84.88s)]
*  States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=88.74s)]
*  I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attacks might be coming. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense, had texted me the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  war plan at 11 44 a.m. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=104.8s)]
*  This is going to require some explaining. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=110.64s)]
*  On Tuesday, March 11th, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=112.4s)]
*  Michael Waltz, the name of the Trump National Security Advisor. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=117.72s)]
*  I accepted the connection request hoping that this was the actual National Security Advisor [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=121.28s)]
*  and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine or Iran or something, some other important matter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=125.84s)]
*  Two days later, Thursday at 4 28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  chat group. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=136.56s)]
*  It was called the, quote, Houthi PC Small Group. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=138.3s)]
*  A message to the group from Michael Waltz read as follows, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  Team, establishing a principles group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=145.02s)]
*  over the next 72 hours. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=149.62s)]
*  My deputy, Alex Wong, is pulling together a Tiger team at deputies and agency chief [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  of staff level following up from the meeting in the sit room, the situation room this morning [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=156.46s)]
*  for action items and will be sending out that later this evening. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=161.78s)]
*  The term principles committee generally refers to a group of the senior most national security [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=166.3s)]
*  officials including the secretaries of defense, state and the treasury as well as the director [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=170.08s)]
*  of the CIA. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway, that I have never been invited [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  to a White House principles committee meeting and that in my many years of reporting on [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  national security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  app. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=187.5s)]
*  The principles had apparently assembled and all 18 individuals were listed as members [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  of this group. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=194.22000000000003s)]
*  I appeared on my own screen as JG. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=196.06s)]
*  At 8.05am on Friday, March 14th, Michael Waltz teched to the group, quote, Team, you should [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=198.82s)]
*  have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the president's guidance this morning [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=204.02s)]
*  in your high side inboxes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=209.5s)]
*  High side in government parlance refers to classified computer and communication systems. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=211.58s)]
*  This is shocking, shocking that it's not just one of a standard classified conversation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=217.06s)]
*  All conversations in Washington are classified. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=229.78s)]
*  This is as sensitive as it gets. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=233.22s)]
*  They are talking here about a surprise attack on a country that the United States was not [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=236.38s)]
*  bombing and they were talking about the most precise detailed operational aspects of this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=242.82s)]
*  bombing campaign. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  Where they were going to bomb, exactly what time they were going to start bombing, which [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=251.26s)]
*  military weapons they were going to use to bomb. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=254.78s)]
*  Obviously anybody who gets this information and leaked it could sabotage the attack or [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=259.18s)]
*  put service members who are carrying it out in obvious danger if the Houthis know exactly [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=264.5s)]
*  where planes are coming and what targets they're going to use. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=270.5s)]
*  They could do all sorts of things to sabotage it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=273.06s)]
*  To put Jeffrey Goldberg into a top secret meeting even though he has no top secret security [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=276.26s)]
*  clearance, seemingly by mistake but who knows? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=281.38s)]
*  That is incompetence on a security breach of the most extreme kind you can imagine. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  But that's something for other people to worry about. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm not particularly concerned with national security breaches like that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=298.38s)]
*  I think way too much is classified. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=301.94s)]
*  Although even I, generally on the far end of absolutism when it comes to state and government [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=304.58s)]
*  transparency recognize and have always said that of course there are some things that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=311.34s)]
*  ought to be secret, some things that ought to be hidden. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=316.3s)]
*  One of those is troop movements. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  This would be like if you planned D-Day and you accidentally included Nazi sympathizing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=321.86s)]
*  or communist sympathizing or anti-American journalists in your planning meeting and they [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=330.42s)]
*  learned the details in advance of the invasion of Normandy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=338.86s)]
*  I mean it's on that level of breach. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=345.3s)]
*  But I'll let others worry about that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  All of Washington is a flutter about that sort of thing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  They pretend to love classified information and it's sanctity when it suits them although [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=351.78s)]
*  they leak classified information all the time. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=355.38s)]
*  When they proceed that suits them as well. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=357.73999999999995s)]
*  What I'm more interested in is the debate that ensued, the conversation about the bombing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=359.26s)]
*  attack and who said what to get a glimpse into the mindset of Trump's national security [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=364.34s)]
*  team. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=370.26s)]
*  So here's what Goldberg wrote, quote, at this point a fascinating policy discussion commenced. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=372.78s)]
*  The account labeled JD Vance responded at 8 16, quote, team I am out for the day doing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=379.74s)]
*  an economic event in Michigan but I think we are making a mistake. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=385.58s)]
*  And then Princeton's Goldberg says Vance was indeed in Michigan that day. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=391.1s)]
*  The Vance account goes on to state, quote, 3% of US trade runs through the Suez. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=395.62s)]
*  40% of European trade does. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  There's a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=404.74s)]
*  The strongest reason to do so is as POTUS said to send a message. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=407.94s)]
*  Now on the one hand this is not a very vehement objection. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=413.82s)]
*  He wasn't bounding the table and saying this is wrong and we cannot do this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=420.58s)]
*  But you have to remember JD Vance has a potentially purely empty and symbolic role in the Trump [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=425.54s)]
*  administration. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=433.22s)]
*  He's the vice president. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=434.22s)]
*  He really has no official duties. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=435.22s)]
*  Whatever duties he gets, whatever influence he has is solely because Trump gives it to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=436.94s)]
*  him and therefore he's always being quite careful not to seem like he's a radical dissident [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=441.26s)]
*  to the Trump agenda. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=445.58s)]
*  But nonetheless he and he alone did stand up and say I think this is a mistake because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=447.09999999999997s)]
*  there's no real US interests involved here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  We have a tiny amount of shipping that goes through the Suez. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=458.34s)]
*  It's the Europeans who have enormous amounts and while we're out there demanding that Europe [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=464.34s)]
*  take responsibility for its own defense and that we not bear the brunt of it anymore, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  here we are about to do exactly that in a way that the public won't understand. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=474.46s)]
*  Now I guess you might consider it a coincidence, I don't, that the position of the Houthis [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=478.09999999999997s)]
*  under Trump has been not that we're going to attack American ships but that we're only [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=485.74s)]
*  going to attack Israeli ships. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=489.78s)]
*  To me this is much more a bombing campaign designed to protect Israel than to protect [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=492.72s)]
*  the Europeans. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=495.88000000000005s)]
*  No one's going to say that, no one's going to admit that, but that's the truth. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=497.72s)]
*  And yet it was JD Vance despite the extremely insignificant, almost trivial connection to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  US interests who stood up and said this is wrong, this is a mistake. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  The Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement considering that the vice president [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=515.88s)]
*  has not deviated publicly from Trump's position on virtually any issue. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=520.68s)]
*  I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=524.8399999999999s)]
*  There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=530.8399999999999s)]
*  I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself but [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=534.64s)]
*  there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=539.0s)]

*  So he was essentially saying this is wrong, I'm against it, but at least let's wait a [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=545.88s)]
*  month so we can figure out what we're really doing here, like why the urgency, why the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=549.6s)]
*  immediacy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=554.12s)]
*  At 827 a message arrived from the Pete Hegseth account, quote, VP, I understand your concerns [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=555.12s)]
*  and fully support your raising with POTUS, important considerations, most of which are [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=563.12s)]
*  tough to know how they play out, the economy, the Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=567.32s)]
*  I think messaging is what's going to be tough, I think messaging is going to be tough no [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  nobody knows who the Houthis are, which is why we would need to stay focused on one, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=577.04s)]
*  Biden failed and two, Iran funded. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=582.88s)]
*  In other words, they have no way to explain to the American people why bombing the Houthis [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=586.16s)]
*  is in their interest, why bombing Yemen is in their interest. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  So Hegseth is saying let's just simplify it and just avoid the real reasons and just say [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=596.24s)]
*  Biden failed, even though Biden actually bombed Yemen continuously throughout 2024. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  But this is always the Republican narrative, the Democrats are weak, they say Democrats [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=610.42s)]
*  and Biden were weak on Israel, even though the United States under Biden paid for Israel's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=614.02s)]
*  entire war, funded and armed that war, diplomatically protected Israel every day at the UN. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=617.9s)]
*  It was Obama who signed a deal on his way out of office with Netanyahu to give the Israelis [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=624.74s)]
*  $38 billion in military aid over 10 years, but of course the Fox News Republican narrative [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=629.82s)]
*  always has to be, oh the Democrats hate Israel, etc. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=634.9s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, the highest ranking Democrat has a book out warning of the anti-Semitism [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=637.94s)]
*  crisis that has engulfed America and said, my job is to make sure the left stays pro-Israel. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=643.02s)]
*  The idea that the Democrats are weak on Israel or the Middle East or whatever is laughable, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=651.26s)]
*  it's a joke, but Hegseth is saying that's how we have to sell it to the public. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=654.94s)]
*  Biden failed and let's scare them over the connection to Iran. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=660.1400000000001s)]
*  The Hegseth message goes on to state, quote, waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=663.94s)]
*  change the calculus. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=668.44s)]
*  Two immediate risks on waiting, one, this leaks and we all looked indecisive. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=670.1800000000001s)]
*  Two, Israel takes an action first or a Gaza ceasefire falls apart and we don't get to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=675.9000000000001s)]
*  start this on our own terms. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=681.84s)]
*  We can manage both. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=683.54s)]
*  We are prepared to execute and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=685.16s)]
*  This is not about the Houthis. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=689.9399999999999s)]
*  I see it as about two things. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=691.8199999999999s)]
*  One, restoring freedom of navigation, a core national interest, and two, reestablish deterrence [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=693.5s)]
*  which Biden cratered. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=698.6999999999999s)]
*  But we can easily pause and if I do so, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=701.18s)]
*  operational security. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=707.66s)]
*  I welcome other thoughts. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=708.66s)]
*  It's very ironic that Pete Hegseth is promising 100% OPSEC, operational security, on this [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=710.66s)]
*  plan when they're all doing this planning in front of an anti-Trump journalist that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=717.1s)]
*  they have no idea has been invited by the National Security Advisor into this group [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=721.4599999999999s)]
*  unwittingly or otherwise. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=725.3s)]
*  Goldberg goes on, quote, it was the next morning, Saturday, March 15th, when the story became [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=729.2199999999999s)]
*  truly bizarre. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=733.06s)]
*  At 11.44am, the account labeled Pete Hegseth posted in Signal a, quote, team update. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=734.6199999999999s)]
*  I will not quote from this update or from certain other subsequent texts. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=741.8599999999999s)]
*  The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=745.3399999999999s)]
*  States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=749.18s)]
*  particularly in the broader Middle East Central Command's area of responsibility. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=754.18s)]
*  What I will say in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of the Signal conversation [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=757.6999999999999s)]
*  is that Hegseth posted, the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=762.22s)]
*  on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=769.02s)]
*  sequencing. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=774.22s)]
*  The only person to reply to the update from Hegseth would be the person identified as [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=777.22s)]
*  the Vice President, quote, I will say a prayer for victory, Vance wrote. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=780.26s)]
*  Two other users subsequently added prayer emojis. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=784.18s)]
*  According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=788.1s)]
*  hours hence at 1.45 p.m. Eastern time. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=791.86s)]
*  So I waited in my car in a parking lot of a supermarket. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=795.62s)]
*  If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned who the targets would soon be bombed. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=798.58s)]
*  At about 1.55 I checked X and searched Yemen. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=802.26s)]
*  Explosions were then being heard across Sana, the capital city, which is how he knew that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=805.42s)]
*  that chat was authentic. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=812.46s)]
*  Now with the story, everyone's being asked about it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=815.0600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely nobody is denying that the chat is authentic. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=817.46s)]
*  When the State Department spokesperson was asked why this happened, she simply said we're [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=820.62s)]
*  not commenting on it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=825.14s)]
*  At Donald Trump's press appearance, which to his credit he does essentially every day [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=827.98s)]
*  in the Roosevelt Room, a reporter in a very weird, timid way asked Trump about this story [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=832.5400000000001s)]
*  and Trump denied all knowledge of it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=840.14s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=842.14s)]
*  You're reacting to the story in The Atlantic that said that some of your top accounting [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=843.14s)]
*  officials and aides have been discussing very sensitive material through Signal and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=849.06s)]
*  included an Atlantic reporter for that. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=853.6199999999999s)]
*  What is your response to that? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=855.6199999999999s)]
*  And are you going to take it? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=856.6199999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=857.6199999999999s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=858.78s)]
*  To me it's a magazine that's going out of business. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=860.66s)]
*  I think it's not much of a magazine, but I know nothing about it. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=862.66s)]
*  You're saying that they had what? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=866.06s)]
*  They were using Signal to coordinate on sensitive materials. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=868.0999999999999s)]
*  Having to do with what? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=872.8199999999999s)]
*  Having to do with what? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=873.8199999999999s)]
*  What were they talking about? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=874.8199999999999s)]
*  With the Houthis. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=875.8199999999999s)]
*  The Houthis? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=876.8199999999999s)]
*  The Houthis, you mean the attack on the Houthis? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=878.58s)]
*  Well it couldn't have been very effective because the attack was very effective, I can [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=881.34s)]
*  tell you that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=884.74s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=885.74s)]
*  You're telling me about it for the first time. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=886.74s)]
*  Any other? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=889.38s)]
*  Mr. President, I'll just say that it was done on your time. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=890.38s)]
*  I know, the Atlantic article came out and obviously everybody in Washington and political [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=894.38s)]
*  circles was talking about it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=900.38s)]
*  I don't doubt actually that Trump hasn't heard about it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=902.2600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't follow the news cycle all that closely. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=905.3s)]
*  But later after this, the White House put out a statement through Caroline Leavitt, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=910.8199999999999s)]
*  the White House press secretary saying, President Trump has full and complete confidence in [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=915.42s)]
*  his national security advisor, Mike Walz, even though Mike Walz added a journalist, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=920.2199999999999s)]
*  a hostile journalist to their planning for a new war. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=926.0999999999999s)]
*  And the, I mean that's illegal by the way to transmit classified information to someone [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=934.54s)]
*  not authorized to receive it. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=940.14s)]
*  Pam Bondi, Tulsi Gabbard, others in the Trump administration have said they will have zero [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=942.4599999999999s)]
*  tolerance for leaks of classified information. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=947.14s)]
*  They're lucky that Jeffrey Goldberg has a very similar foreign policy to people like [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=951.42s)]
*  Mike Walz. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=956.62s)]
*  He's obviously in favor of the bombing of Yemen because it helps Israel, whose foreign [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=957.9399999999999s)]
*  military he joined and served as a prison guard in an Israeli detention camp for Palestinians. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=963.7s)]
*  And he's been an advocate of the Iraq war, did more than anybody to spread the lie that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=971.5s)]
*  Saddam Hussein was involved in Al-Qaeda in order to justify that war. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=975.1800000000001s)]
*  So obviously it was safe in that sense because Jeffrey Goldberg was going to be a supporter [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=980.5s)]
*  of it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=986.7s)]
*  He has a very similar worldview to Mike Walz. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=987.7s)]
*  Both of them are standard GOP militants and neocons, but still it's a gigantic mistake [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=991.7s)]
*  at best, a huge national security breach. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=998.7s)]
*  And had it been done with the wrong person it could easily have put the lives of American [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1003.5400000000001s)]
*  troops in harm's way. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1008.7s)]
*  And why were they using Signal? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1010.6600000000001s)]
*  The government pays for extremely sophisticated classified networks to talk about these sorts [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1012.86s)]
*  of things on. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1020.7s)]
*  And I consider Signal relatively safe from the commercial apps. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1022.98s)]
*  It's probably the safest. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1026.26s)]
*  It's the one I use when I'm having conversations that I don't want to be easily invaded, but [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1027.9s)]
*  it's far from invulnerable. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1036.78s)]
*  Do you know scammers can literally steal your home right out from under you? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1043.54s)]
*  The FBI calls it house stealing and it's a growing real estate scam targeting American [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1047.5s)]
*  homeowners. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1052.3s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0D2mL-mrcw&t=1053.3s)]
