# Media Pushes Obvious Deep State PsyOp
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk)
*  Now, speaking of skepticism, it's actually the perfect segue into our last segment because, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=0.0s)]
*  as we just showed you, President Zelensky is in Washington desperately trying to get [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=13.8s)]
*  this last, this latest $60 billion, facing a lot of opposition from Republicans in Congress, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=17.92s)]
*  from public opinion that is eroding quickly against the war. And lo and behold, we have the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=23.08s)]
*  perfect leak from the security state, published by the New York Times and CNN and every other [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  media outlet, that is the perfect claim if you want to convince people to just keep funding the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=36.92s)]
*  Here CNN reports, quote, Russia has lost 87% of its troops that it had prior to the start of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=45.64s)]
*  the Ukraine war, according to US intelligence assessment. Quote, the assessment sent to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=53.88s)]
*  Capitol Hill on Monday comes as some Republicans have balked at the US providing additional [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=61.36s)]
*  funding for Ukraine and the Biden administration has launched a full court press to try to get [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=66.2s)]
*  supplemental spending through Congress. Of the 360,000 troops that made up Russia's pre-invasion [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=71.32s)]
*  ground force, including contract and conscript personnel, Russia has lost 315,000 on the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=78.32s)]
*  battlefield, according to the assessment. 2000 of 3500 tanks have been lost, according to the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  assessment, 4400 of 13,600 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  also been destroyed a 32% loss rate. Quote, as of late November, Russia lost over a quarter of its [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=98.92s)]
*  pre-invasion stockpiles of ground force equipment, the assessment reads. This has reduced the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  complexity and scale of Russian offensive operations, which have failed to make major [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=110.6s)]
*  gains in Ukraine since early 2002. Now, first of all, anytime you have an anonymous intelligence [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=115.6s)]
*  report that perfectly aligns with the war aims of the US security state, the only rational thing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=125.88s)]
*  to do is to disbelieve it, to subject it to extreme skepticism because of how many times the US [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=133.28s)]
*  security state has lied using exactly these methods. The US security state lied the country [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=139.56s)]
*  into the Vietnam War with a fabricated claim about North Vietnamese aggression in the Gulf [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  of Tonkin. It lied the United States into war in Iraq. It lied the country into staying in wars [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=149.2s)]
*  in Syria and Libya. It's lied continuously about the war in Ukraine. And seeing how many people [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=158.6s)]
*  just instantly believe things like this. First of all, if the Russian military is really as [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=167.0s)]
*  destroyed as this report suggests, why haven't the Ukrainians been able to break through their [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=172.2s)]
*  defensive lines? They're claiming that their military is basically destroyed. They have no [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=177.6s)]
*  people left, no military equipment left. Why then, with hundreds of millions of dollars from the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=184.2s)]
*  West and all the most sophisticated equipment that the West can give, Ukraine has Ukraine lost [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  ground in 2023 if the Russian military is really disintegrating to this extent? This is obviously [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=195.92s)]
*  propaganda designed to convince people, oh, just hang on, keep funding Ukraine because they're [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=202.48s)]
*  very close to destroying the Russian army and yet nothing in the war suggests that's true. And it's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  just unbelievable to watch how many people still are conditioned to just uncritically ingest whatever [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=213.92s)]
*  the US security state disseminates through the media. If you want to see how blatantly advocates [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=220.32s)]
*  of the Ukraine war are willing to lie, how desperate they're getting. Here is Congressman [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=228.68s)]
*  Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, on the House floor. And you can hear the desperation in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  his voice. Listen to what he says is true about the war in Ukraine and the Republicans' refusal to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=240.72s)]
*  send money without any safeguards at least on where the money is being spent. And if we accede to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  where half of the Republican majority is today, which is that we're not going to support Ukraine [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=255.68s)]
*  in this fight, Putin will not stop. And soon the United States will have no choice but to step in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=261.72s)]
*  to stop Vladimir Putin. We hear these excuses, there's not enough accounting, there's not enough [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=270.64s)]
*  oversight. We didn't hear that when we were supporting the Afghani regime, profoundly corrupt. We [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=277.76s)]
*  didn't hear that about Iraq, we're only hearing that about Ukraine. We hear that we would like [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=282.76000000000005s)]
*  to know what the plan is for victory in Ukraine. Did anybody ask Winston Churchill, the hero of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  World War II, what his plan for victory was? No, they did not because he wasn't sure. But we stood [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=294.88000000000005s)]
*  by him because he stood for liberty and he stood for the moral clarity that this institution has [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=300.68s)]
*  now lost. If we think for one moment that Putin is the only one who is enjoying this moment, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=305.44s)]
*  think about what President Xi of China is learning. Think about what the Iranian mullahs are seeing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=312.44s)]
*  Think about what the North Korean dictator is coming to understand. That this Congress, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=319.12s)]
*  when faced with the demand that we fight for liberty and freedom, we cut and run. That's what [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=325.52s)]
*  is being learned. And anybody who reads an iota of history will understand the tragedy that is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=333.56s)]
*  behind that. He sounds exactly like Nikki Haley, exactly like Tom Cotton, exactly like Marco Rubio, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=339.16s)]
*  exactly like Liz Cheney. Do you see how identical the Democrats and Republicans are, the establishment [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=348.6s)]
*  wings of those parties when it comes to foreign policy? First of all, everything is Hitler, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=356.24s)]
*  everything is World War II again. Oh, we didn't ask Winston Churchill what his plan was. Why would [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=362.12s)]
*  we ask the United States government what its plan is in this war? Because we've been caught in so [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=368.32s)]
*  many wars with no exit strategy, with no clear strategy, and all it's done is eaten up American [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=375.0s)]
*  resources, destroy American standing in the world, and ended up causing us to lose so many wars [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=380.96s)]
*  because we had no plan. But you see everything is World War II. Everything is either you support [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=386.12s)]
*  war and you're Winston Churchill or you oppose it and you're giving in to it off Hitler just like [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=394.16s)]
*  Neville Chamberlain did. Beyond that, this is the same worldview as Republicans have. We're faced [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=401.88s)]
*  with an axis of evil composed of Iran, China, North Korea, Russia. This is standard Republican [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=408.36s)]
*  foreign policy orthodoxy that is coming out of the mouth of these desperate Democrats to fuel this [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=416.48s)]
*  war in Ukraine. But he also lied when he said there were no calls for safeguards or investigations [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=421.68s)]
*  into where the money went for Afghanistan and Iraq. There were all kinds of investigations about where [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=427.8s)]
*  the money went in Iraq and Afghanistan. What we found was we have no safeguards. Billions of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=434.92s)]
*  dollars just appear here from CNN in October 2021. Summarizing the investigation, hundreds of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=439.56s)]
*  billions of dollars were spent by the US and Afghanistan. Here are 10 of the starkest examples [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  of waste, fraud, and abuse. Half a billion dollars of aircraft that flew for about a year, a huge [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  $85 million hotel that never opened and sits in disrepair, camouflage uniforms for the Afghan [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=461.92s)]
*  army whose fancy pattern would cost an extra $28 million, a health care facility listed as located [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=467.8s)]
*  in the Mediterranean Sea. These are part of a catalog of waste, fraud, and abuse complaints made [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  against the United States reconstruction effort in Afghanistan, an effort totaling $145 billion [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=480.0s)]
*  over 20 years, made by the United States' own inspector general into the war. But the in-depth [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=486.48s)]
*  audits detailing these findings have, for the most part, been taken offline at the request of the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  State Department, citing security concerns. The total cost of the war, according to the Pentagon, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=497.68s)]
*  was $825 billion, a low-end estimate. Even President Joe Biden has cited an estimate that put [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  the amount at over double that, more than $2 trillion. For the war in Afghanistan where the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=511.28s)]
*  Taliban marched right back in the minute we left, the interest on the debt runs into hundreds of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  billions of dollars already. This is what the military industrial complex in Washington does [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  all the time. They use anonymous leaks to lie. They use the same exact rhetoric to continue wars [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  all the time. And the Democrats and the Republicans, the war-making parts of both parties, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  are completely indistinguishable. I don't understand how Nikki Haley will debate Joe Biden on foreign [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=548.96s)]
*  policy, given that they're in full agreement on Ukraine, they're in full agreement on Israel, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=554.64s)]
*  they're in full agreement on China, as is most of the Republican Party with Joe Biden and with these [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=559.2s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLvaLdY8Bk&t=564.32s)]
