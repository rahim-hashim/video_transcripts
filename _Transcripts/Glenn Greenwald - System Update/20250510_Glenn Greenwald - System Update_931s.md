# Yanis Varoufakis: Europe Being Sold TOXIC Lies
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8)
*  Your honor, it's great to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=7.72s)]
*  We're excited about it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=10.72s)]
*  I have a lot of questions, so why don't we dive in. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=11.72s)]
*  So I want to obviously talk most about things that are going on today, and there are plenty [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=14.96s)]
*  of wars and conflicts and economic issues that merit a great deal of attention. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=20.12s)]
*  So I want to spend the bulk on that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  But before I get to that, I actually want to talk about, just briefly, the time in 2015 [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=25.6s)]
*  when you served as Greece's finance minister. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=30.44s)]
*  And I think that was when your work became known to huge audiences around the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=34.68s)]
*  I think that was when I first became aware of your work. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  And it was just so interesting for those who don't know, because Greece was facing this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=42.32s)]
*  debt crisis. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=44.92s)]
*  The EU and the World Bank and the European Bank were squeezing Greece, trying to force [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=46.32s)]
*  you into these austerity measures that you had been elected to resist. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=55.24s)]
*  And it kind of went into this major conflict. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  You won a referendum in your country where you convinced people to reject the EU deal, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  but the leadership of your party and of Greece ended up ultimately, as you called it, surrendering, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=67.08s)]
*  and then you resigned. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=71.0s)]
*  And that's a very broad summary. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=72.0s)]
*  Feel free to add whatever you want to that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=74.72s)]
*  But what I'm interested in knowing is, what did you walk away from having learned from [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=80.48s)]
*  Did your experience shape your views today of neoliberalism or the EU or just political [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  conflicts in general? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, a couple of parts to this answer, I think, might help our audience. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=89.0s)]
*  The first one concerns the causes of the crisis that you described. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  And to connect with a mainly United States-based audience, it is important for you folks to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=100.0s)]
*  realize that what happened here in Greece was the direct repercussion of the collapse [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=106.16s)]
*  of Wall Street in 2008, because the collapse of Wall Street precipitated, just like in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=110.36s)]
*  1929, the absolute deep bankruptcy of every single bank in Germany and in France. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=115.4s)]
*  You only need to state this in order to realize the enormous amount of this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=123.96s)]
*  And it was panic stations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=127.76s)]
*  Governments didn't understand why they collapsed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=131.76s)]
*  They had no idea where to find the money to save them, to bail them out, because unlike [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=134.32s)]
*  the United States, where you had the Federal Reserve that could go in cahoots with the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=138.36s)]
*  federal government and immediately bring the money that was necessary through TAP, through [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  various other means, quantitative easing, the Europeans had this rule that we do not [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=147.0s)]
*  save either the banks of a nation state or the government of a nation state. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=151.52s)]
*  So they had to find ways of violating the rules while pretending that they are respecting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  them. So you can imagine the shit show that that was, excuse my not particularly scientific [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=162.96s)]
*  term. And then they started, you know, they were just like silly cats chasing their own [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=167.6s)]
*  tail. And they they were borrowing from the weakest of the citizenry around Europe in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=173.48s)]
*  order effectively to bail out the banks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=182.64s)]
*  They couldn't even print money at the beginning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=185.2s)]
*  So Greece being the most fragile and economically challenged part of this block called the Eurozone, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=187.28s)]
*  we collapsed first. But it was the first domino of a domino effect. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  By the time I got into government five years later in 2015, I only had one task, one objective. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=204.44s)]
*  That was the mandate that I had received from the Greek people to resist being forced to take yet [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=213.2s)]
*  another credit card from the powers that be, from international financiers, from the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=219.6s)]
*  International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, so on, from [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=224.96s)]
*  which to draw money at high interest rates in order to pretend to be repaying the German and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=230.16s)]
*  the French banks. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=236.6s)]
*  Because not only were they insisting that I should take a credit card on behalf of our [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=238.8s)]
*  suffering people, but that the conditions for giving me these credit cards was even harsher [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=242.84s)]
*  austerity that would crush whatever incomes that were left. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  So anyway, this is history. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=251.56s)]
*  But it's not just history, because Glenn, allow me to say something that I think will connect with [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  the Eurozone today, directly connect. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  I remember one of my debates, deliberations, clashes with the German finance minister, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  a certain gentleman going by the name of Volkan Schäuble, he has passed on now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=272.76s)]
*  Very important and smart and powerful man in the European Union at the time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=277.96s)]
*  He was pushing the line that only through belt tightening, austerity, can we essentially become [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=284.08s)]
*  self-sufficient again, we Greeks. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  And what he had in mind about self-sufficiency was that we would become net exporters. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=294.92s)]
*  And through the net exports, be able to pay back our debts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  And this is a German model. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=306.68s)]
*  And when I said to him, Volkan, you realize that if we all do that, if we all become net exporters, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  like Germany's, if we all become Germany's, then it is the United States that will have to take on [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=315.36s)]
*  all the net exports that we are exporting, because the Chinese are net exporters, the Japanese are [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  net exporters. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=330.96s)]
*  If we all become in Europe, net exporters, who on earth is going to be a net importer? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=332.08s)]
*  The United States, which, of course, was a net importer. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=337.12s)]
*  But effectively, what Europe did between the great financial collapse of 2008 and today is they [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=340.4s)]
*  created, to some extent, with the help of Obama, I have to say, Donald Trump. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=347.67999999999995s)]
*  Because when Donald Trump says that, you know, folks, you Europeans, you have 240 billion dollars [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  of trade surplus with the United States, that can't continue. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=359.04s)]
*  Well, you know, he's a madman. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=362.48s)]
*  He's a very poor excuse for human nature. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=364.24s)]
*  I consider him to be a proto-fascist, a quasi-fascist. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  But on this, he's right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=370.8s)]
*  And this is exactly what Europe did in order to overcome the bankruptcy of its banks after Wall [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=372.24s)]
*  Street collapsed in 2008. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  Essentially pushed all our countries through austerity, harsh austerity, through [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=382.48s)]
*  mind-numbing levels of poverty, to tighten our belts so much to stop consuming locally [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=388.8s)]
*  so that we all become net exporters. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=395.2s)]
*  And you see the chickens are coming home to roost now because you have that madman in the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  White House who correctly points out that Europe has been a freeloader on this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=401.44s)]
*  Now, of course, what he is proposing instead is utterly mad and bad. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=407.6s)]
*  But this is the problem that Europe has. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  Europe is not this democratic, civilized, rational place that has just been assaulted by [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=415.92s)]
*  the madman with the orange hair. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=425.04s)]
*  Europe is at fault. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=428.16s)]
*  We have treated our own peoples abysmally through this combination of harsh austerity for the many [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=430.0s)]
*  across Europe, not just in Greece, in Germany as well. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  Low levels of investment and net exports to the rest of the world. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=439.92s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=444.88s)]
*  I want to get to the Trump terror plan in a minute and the whole scheme that he's trying to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=448.08s)]
*  implement, what those goals are. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=453.44s)]
*  But just staying on Europe for a second, I do think certainly rhetorically and maybe [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=454.64s)]
*  in an enduring and sustained way, European leaders are thinking about the world differently, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=461.04s)]
*  in part because of Trump's obvious desire to abandon Ukraine, kind of force a peace deal [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=465.84s)]
*  on them and leaving Europe to think, oh, wow, we can't rely on the US anymore. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=472.64s)]
*  We better go do that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=476.4s)]
*  He even talks about forcing the Europeans to take on more of their own defense responsibility [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=477.28s)]
*  and these huge budgets that are now coming for vastly increased spending on the military in the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=483.44s)]
*  name of, I don't know, saving Ukraine or making the EU into some sort of independent military [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=489.28s)]
*  power no longer needing to rely on the US. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=493.52s)]
*  If that were to take place, if this defense spending increases, these significant defense [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=496.32s)]
*  spending increases that we're being told to expect that are even coming, actually has [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=501.52s)]
*  started to happen and the EU really starts rearming and building its military in a very [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  meaningful way as it says it believes it has to do. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=510.56s)]
*  What effect would that have on this kind of already tattered social fabric in the EU where [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=513.92s)]
*  people feel besieged, very similar sentiments to what's taking place throughout the democratic [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  world. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  They feel like these distant establishment institutions don't care about them at all. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=523.92s)]
*  Will that exacerbate it or what will be the implications of all that? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=528.88s)]
*  Glenn, the dominant paradigm, the dominant narrative in Europe is that, well, we can't [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=533.84s)]
*  any longer sell our cars because they're not competitive in relation to BYD, the Chinese [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=540.48s)]
*  ones or Tesla. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=545.36s)]
*  So we might as well convert Volkswagen's production lines into production lines producing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=546.8s)]
*  cars for Rheinmetall and we will grow through this kind of rearmament project. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=552.8s)]
*  Allow me to put it a bit slightly more pseudo scientifically, military Keynesianism. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=559.28s)]
*  That's a dominant paradigm. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=565.76s)]
*  It is dangerously erroneous. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=567.68s)]
*  It is such a myth. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=570.8s)]
*  It is such a toxic lie that is being sold to Europeans. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=572.64s)]
*  And allow me to say this, military Keynesianism does work. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=576.8s)]
*  It can work. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  It worked under Hitler. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=581.52s)]
*  Within two years, Hitler eliminated unemployment, Germany grew. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=584.56s)]
*  But of course, there was a second world war because ammunition, once you start basing [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=588.56s)]
*  your whole growth strategy and producing more ammunition, at some point your warehouses [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=596.24s)]
*  will be full. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=600.64s)]
*  So you will need to restock. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=601.68s)]
*  You will need to get rid of it in order to restock. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=603.92s)]
*  So you need a war. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=605.76s)]
*  In the United States, military Keynesianism has worked since the late 1930s. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=606.56s)]
*  It's the reason. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=614.4s)]
*  On the one hand, yes, of course, there was FDR, New Deal. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=615.76s)]
*  But if it wasn't for the second world war, the German, the American economy would not [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  have recovered to the extent that it did and it would not have become so dominant during [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=624.2399999999999s)]
*  the Bretton Woods era. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=628.64s)]
*  So military Keynesianism worked. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  But this is why the United States needs to conduct a war every one, two, three years. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=631.28s)]
*  Sometimes every year. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=637.04s)]
*  And that's why we had Korea. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=638.2399999999999s)]
*  That's why we had Vietnam. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=639.3599999999999s)]
*  That's why we had Iraq. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=640.56s)]
*  That's why we had... [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=641.52s)]
*  Because the stock needs to be replenished for military Keynesians to work. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, is Europe proposing to start its own sequence of wars in order to keep the military [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=647.28s)]
*  Keynesian multiplier accelerator growth model going? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=655.52s)]
*  Firstly, it will be catastrophic ethically and from the perspective of the human species [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  to do this. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=665.52s)]
*  Secondly, they can't do it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=666.96s)]
*  They really can't do it because in order to start a war, you need to have somebody who [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  can make the decision to start the war. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, in the United States, you have the American president. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=674.72s)]
*  You have Congress. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=677.28s)]
*  Who in Europe can decide, even if we created, let's say we created a massive European army, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=678.64s)]
*  who's going to decide whether they should go to war or not tomorrow? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=684.64s)]
*  Who will send these men and women to the battlefield? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  I hope that never happens. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  But if it happens, who is going to decide that? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  The European Commission president, Mrs Ursula von der Leyen, doesn't even have a democratic [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=695.44s)]
*  mandate in her own neighborhood. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=701.44s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=703.2s)]
*  She would like to do it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  She would like to do it, but... [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=705.2s)]
*  Zero democratic legitimacy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not even in her job description. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  Once upon a time, we had Angela Merkel, who was the de facto leader of Europe because [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  Germany still had a massive surplus that was sustainable to the extent that everybody else [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  was practicing. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  They can't even elect... [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=724.0s)]
*  The pope was elected more speedily than the chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=726.24s)]
*  France has a lame, dark president. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  France is a deficit country anyway. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=735.36s)]
*  When I was in government, there was a north-south divide in Europe. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=737.52s)]
*  Now there is also an east-west divide. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=740.08s)]
*  So what I'm saying, briefly, it can't work. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=741.76s)]
*  It won't work. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=744.88s)]
*  Europe will stagnate faster because they are borrowing as we speak. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=746.16s)]
*  You know, there is a directive that is coming to our capitals from Brussels saying shift [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=751.5200000000001s)]
*  resources, funding from social programs to military spending. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=757.36s)]
*  Now this is in a Europe where the majority have been treated like cattle that lost their [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=762.88s)]
*  market value long ago. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  And this is why they are turning towards the ultra right, just like in the mid-war period, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=771.5200000000001s)]
*  to reduce social spending in order to buy tanks that we neither need nor want. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=775.9200000000001s)]
*  While increasing the indebtedness of our already fiscally stressed countries to do so without [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  any multiplier accelerator developmental growth machine happening in the medium term. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=789.2s)]
*  This is simply digging the hole in which we find ourselves deeper instead of stopping digging. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  If your dog is constantly itching, scratching, or dealing with hot spots, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=806.48s)]
*  you've got to check out Cote Defense. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=810.56s)]
*  It's an all-natural solution that's been helping so many dogs. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=812.16s)]
*  And I say that, as you probably know, we have roughly 25 dogs at home. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=815.68s)]
*  We have a shelter with another 150 or 200. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=818.88s)]
*  And they often have these itching and skin problems. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  And there hasn't really been a solution for a long time. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=823.92s)]
*  Here's why this caught my attention. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=826.4s)]
*  I've seen it firsthand how often dogs develop things like yeast infections, especially in [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=827.76s)]
*  their paws, ears, and skin folds. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=832.4799999999999s)]
*  It's a lot more common than people realize, but the usual treatments like steroids or [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=834.4s)]
*  antibiotics or apiquel or citipoint, they might cover up the symptom for a while, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=838.56s)]
*  but they don't actually fix the root cause. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=843.5999999999999s)]
*  And in some cases, they actually make things way worse over time. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=845.28s)]
*  Cote Defense is different. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=849.04s)]
*  Their daily preventative power works as a dry shampoo, odor eliminator, and anti-age powder. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=850.16s)]
*  But what makes it special is that it eliminates yeast naturally by changing the terrain on [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=855.3599999999999s)]
*  your dog's skin so that yeast and bacteria can't survive. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  No toxic chemicals, no synthetic junk, just safe, natural ingredients. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=863.52s)]
*  They also make an aloe-based sensitive skin shampoo that calms irritated skin, preserves [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=868.16s)]
*  the natural oils of microbiome, and is totally free of parabens and sulfates and anything [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=873.28s)]
*  artificial. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=878.56s)]
*  And honestly, I've been really surprised reading the testimonials and seeing their products [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=879.04s)]
*  firsthand. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  I've heard from so many people that this is the only thing that has finally worked after [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=883.6s)]
*  years of frustration that has made dogs finally itch-free and healthy again. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fHfe-7Oe8&t=887.28s)]
