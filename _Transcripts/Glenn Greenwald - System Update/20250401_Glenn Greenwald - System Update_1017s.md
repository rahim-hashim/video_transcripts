# Pro-Israel Groups Pushing to Deport Students EXPOSED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg)
*  Now, again, these, the government, Marco Rubio is not finding these people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=0.0s)]
*  Homeland Security is not finding them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=11.4s)]
*  ICE is not finding them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  ICE isn't even looking for them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  They're here legally. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  They only become illegal when Marco Rubio secretly revokes their green card or their [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  visa because they criticize Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=20.12s)]
*  So how do they know where to find these people? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=22.66s)]
*  There are two incredibly shady Israel groups, pro-Israel groups connected to Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=26.02s)]
*  Typically, their funding is completely anonymous. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=32.78s)]
*  There's been reporting on where they get funding. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=36.06s)]
*  Who they are is even anonymous. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  One of them is the Canary Mission, and they have been now for a decade. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=40.18s)]
*  If a student expresses in a classroom criticism of Israel, they take the student's name and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  they put them on a website that has been highly funded so that it's the first Google result. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  If you enter that student's name when they go apply for work, it'll be, here's a list [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=54.7s)]
*  of all the anti-Semites on American campuses. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=58.06s)]
*  While they're doxing students and professors and putting their name on the internet, these [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  cowards will not say or identify themselves who's behind this mission, this Canary Mission. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  And they have been quite boastful of the fact that their list is who Homeland Security and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=72.78s)]
*  the State Department is using to determine who gets removed from the country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=76.94s)]
*  In other words, pro-Israel fanatics are dictating to the US government who can and cannot stay [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=81.02s)]
*  in this country based on whether they love Israel or not. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=85.5s)]
*  That is the literal truth of what is happening. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=87.74s)]
*  And I just don't understand how anybody who claims to believe in free speech or the values [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=90.46s)]
*  of free discourse or academic freedom cannot be anything but enraged by this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=95.58s)]
*  Can be anything but enraged by this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=100.02s)]
*  It's exactly what you've been saying you so vehemently oppose, but this time done to protect [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=102.34s)]
*  a foreign country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=106.69999999999999s)]
*  Here's the Canary Mission on March 27th, boasting of their work to have her deported. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=108.14s)]
*  This is Rumeza Aztark, a Turkish national being deported for activities in support of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=114.5s)]
*  Hamas, according to DHS. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=119.62s)]
*  Sources point to her Canary profile as the primary cause. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=122.34s)]
*  So they're claiming credit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  They're saying our website that's designed to destroy the reputation of anyone who doesn't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=127.58s)]
*  revere and love Israel or who criticizes it is the cause of why the government decided [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=131.78s)]
*  to deport her. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=136.54000000000002s)]
*  And then here is what they have to say about her. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  There you see Rumeza Aztark Tufts University student detained during a routine check-in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=142.18s)]
*  due to quote activities in support of Hamas, according to DHS. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=147.86s)]
*  She graduated from the Teachers College at Columbia University in 2020 and has been living [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=151.22s)]
*  in the US on a student visa until her detention. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=154.78s)]
*  And this is her page on Canary Mission. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=160.22s)]
*  This is the kind of thing they do. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=162.58s)]
*  They put the person's picture, their name, and they pay a lot of money to promote the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=163.62s)]
*  website to make sure that it becomes the first Google search. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=171.34s)]
*  So obviously it's a blacklist, it's like a McCarthyite list, and they label someone a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=173.86s)]
*  terrorist and pro-Hamas simply because they oppose Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=178.02s)]
*  And here's their dossier in her. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=182.5s)]
*  This is the entirety of it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=184.18s)]
*  Rumeza Aztark engaged in anti-Israel activism. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=186.46s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=190.18s)]
*  In March 2024, in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israelis on October 7, on October [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=191.66s)]
*  7th, Hamas murdered approximately 1,200 Israelis, kidnapped hundreds, and wounded thousands. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=197.5s)]
*  War crimes including mass rape and torture. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=201.94s)]
*  Many Palestinian civilians participated in and supported the attacks and Gazans working [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=204.5s)]
*  in the targeted Israeli communities gave intelligence to Hamas on where to strike. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=209.3s)]
*  For more information, see the Canary page on Hamas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=214.38s)]
*  Aztark is a supporter of the boycott, divestment, sanctions movement. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=216.66s)]
*  And then they had this page, Rumeza Aztark. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=223.42s)]
*  By the way, you haven't heard anything specific about what she's done other than write this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=226.66s)]
*  op-ed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=231.82s)]
*  Here under the page, anti-Israel activism, this is what they say she did. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  On March 26, 2024, Aztark co-authored an op-ed published in the Tufts Daily newspaper entitled [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=239.3s)]
*  Try Again, President Kumar, Renewing Calls for the Senate to Adopt Four TCU Senate Resolutions. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=249.86s)]
*  So on their dossier that they say is what caused her deportation, they're admitting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=256.42s)]
*  the primary offense or primary transgression is publishing that op-ed in the Tufts newspaper [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=259.86s)]
*  that they dislike because it was critical of Israel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=266.02s)]
*  And now the government is obeying these pro-Israel groups on who to deport. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=268.5s)]
*  Not based on crimes they committed or property they destroyed or people they harassed or [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=272.42s)]
*  attacked, based on their ideas about one foreign country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=276.34s)]
*  Published in a very professional, very moderately stated op-ed. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=281.74s)]
*  This group goes on, quote, the authors urge, quote, President Kumar and the Tufts administration [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=287.3s)]
*  to meaningfully engage with and actualize the resolutions passed by the Senate. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=291.3s)]
*  The op-ed referred to the passing of anti-Israel resolutions by the Tufts Community Union. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=296.0s)]
*  Senate, which demanded the university, quote, acknowledge the Palestinian genocide, apologize [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=300.88s)]
*  for University President Sunil Kumar's statements, disclose its investments, and divest from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=304.88s)]
*  companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=310.96s)]
*  That's the only thing it lists. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=313.5s)]
*  Obviously, if she had vandalized buildings or attacked Jewish students or praised Hamas, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=315.44s)]
*  that would be in here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=321.76s)]
*  They're very comprehensive. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=323.8s)]
*  The only thing they have on her is that she wrote that op-ed. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=324.8s)]
*  But that's enough for the United States government, eager to serve Israel, defend Israel, shield [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel from criticism, to deport her in the middle of her PhD program. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=331.62s)]
*  Here's another one of the groups that is taking credit for it as well. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=337.44s)]
*  And by the way, the Canary Mission, as I said, they're an extremely secretive group. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=341.56s)]
*  They have a lot of funding. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  They won't say who their funders are. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=347.36s)]
*  They won't even say who they are. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=349.1s)]
*  That's who's dictating to the government who can stay in our country or not based on how [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  much they love Israel or don't. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=354.48s)]
*  The other group is Batar Worldwide. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=356.44s)]
*  It is a radical, pro-Israel group. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=358.6s)]
*  It's considered radical even in Israel. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  And they too took credit. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=367.0s)]
*  Quote, she was on our list. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=368.0s)]
*  Many more jihadis are. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=369.16s)]
*  We will be making a new submission Monday with approximately 1,800 more jihadis. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  Submit to us candidates with proof for ICE government to consider. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=375.26s)]
*  That's where the government's getting these names from, from these very sketchy Israel-connected [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  groups of people they want out of the country for criticizing Israel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=384.52s)]
*  Here's Tammy Bruce, the Department of State spokesperson, being asked about all of this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=388.88s)]
*  And here's what she said. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=392.76s)]
*  So just going back to the visa revocations, there's a group called Batar that has told [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=393.76s)]
*  CBS that they have provided thousands of names to the Trump administration of visa holders [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=400.0s)]
*  and naturalized foreigners who, quote, come to the West to rage against America and support [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=404.8s)]
*  U.S. designated terrorist organizations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=409.84s)]
*  Can you confirm whether that organization is providing lists to the Trump administration [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=412.64s)]
*  and whether those lists are being taken by the State Department and DHS to do any of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=417.32s)]
*  this work? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=423.68s)]
*  You know, I, the Trump administration, I'm not involved in those decisions and I certainly [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=424.68s)]
*  can't speak on them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=430.4s)]
*  Certainly in general, not for the State Department. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=432.16s)]
*  That goes through the framework of the work that we're doing. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=435.04s)]
*  Whether it exists or not, I won't confirm. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=440.44s)]
*  It's a matter of, you know, we've got broad authority certainly, but how they're coming [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=442.76s)]
*  to those decisions for the consular offices and visas. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=446.92s)]
*  We will not discuss not only individual visas, but the process of what goes through in determining [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=451.2s)]
*  what happens with individuals and visas and whether they're issued or if they're revoked. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=457.02s)]
*  So I won't be talking about that today. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=461.0s)]
*  Yes, Nick. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=463.8s)]
*  So these groups are out there taking credit. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=464.8s)]
*  These groups, by the way, only have one cause, one mission, devotion to Israel. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=468.28s)]
*  The United States, Americans, not part of the agenda, just this foreign country of Israel. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  And they're boasting about the fact that they're the ones who are telling Homeland Security [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL73tnU6nbg&t=477.84s)]
