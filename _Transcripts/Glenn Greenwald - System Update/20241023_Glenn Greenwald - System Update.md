# Would A Second Trump Administration Defeat the "Deep State"?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c)
*  Okay, so hey, Lee, how's it going? There's so much that I want to discuss with you. I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=0.0s)]
*  don't even know where to begin. How are you? I'm doing great. Good to see you, Michael. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=13.56s)]
*  And I just want to say, you've been killing it. I love the interviews at the convention [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  and other events you've been doing with Glenn. So few people in independent media are actually [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=23.0s)]
*  critical of other independent media and other independent figures. And most are kind of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=29.78s)]
*  glorifying anyone who's supposedly anti-establishment. And so if you were doing original reporting, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=35.9s)]
*  you're actually doing it. So I appreciate what you're doing. Well, I'm flattered, Lee. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=41.06s)]
*  I feel similarly toward you. I mean, we could get into a whole rabbit hole here of the independent [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=46.14s)]
*  media and my observations of it. I mean, maybe we should. I mean, what the hell? I do feel [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=52.66s)]
*  I listen to you for the second half of your, or I think like a third maybe of your soliloquy, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  your monologue on RFK. And I think it's interesting. I think you raise a lot of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  important points. I'm not super hopeful or I wouldn't predict that there's going to be a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=71.62s)]
*  huge crackdown on the deep state. There's certainly going to be a big kind of exit of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=81.06s)]
*  many people in the bureaucracy and they're probably going to leave not because they're [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  some type of CIA goons, but rather they're folks who don't feel comfortable with Donald Trump as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=90.1s)]
*  president. There are other folks that are being rooted out for being insufficiently loyal to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=95.98s)]
*  Donald Trump. And that's in the three letter intelligence agencies. It's also in the DOJ. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=101.02s)]
*  It's going to be a huge turnover if Trump is victorious in this election. And in terms of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=104.62s)]
*  RFK, one thing I'll say just to kind of push back gently is that we don't know. Your article, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  I think everyone should read the piece, raises a lot of good points for all these kind of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=119.98s)]
*  independent party lines that he kind of got onto and promised to fight the duopoly, fight the two [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=124.9s)]
*  parties. I'm sure a lot of them feel hoodwinked. They're certainly not accomplishing that with a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=131.58s)]
*  partnership with RFK. But I will say that if you watch the last few big speeches from RFK, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=137.66s)]
*  watch some of these recent ads, he's talking about Make America Healthy Again, talking about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=143.9s)]
*  the toxic chemicals in our pesticides, some of the overuse of pharmaceuticals, the chemicals and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  toxic substances we add to our foods and our highly processed foods. Now, one could say that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=155.26s)]
*  Trump as president was very bad on these issues. It was horrible. But one other perspective is that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=162.7s)]
*  he's very ideologically flexible. It's possible that you kind of look down on folks who say, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=169.66s)]
*  oh, he's raising the discourse by joining the Trump campaign. And I share some of that cynicism. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=176.22s)]
*  But perhaps, at least around the edges, for a Republican administration, Bush or Reagan, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  we're not good on these issues either. For a Republican administration, perhaps if he incorporates [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=189.26s)]
*  some of these critiques of big ag or big pesticide, the chemical industry, into his administration, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=194.3s)]
*  it's not so horrible on it as he was the last four years he was in office. That's perhaps a market [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  improvement. I don't know about the rest of the deep space. I don't know about what's going to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=207.1s)]
*  happen in Ukraine. But on food and chemicals, perhaps there's something to be optimistic about. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=210.86s)]
*  But, Lee, if RFK Jr.'s candidacy was primarily based on his desire to remove toxins from the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  soil supply, I don't think anybody really would have objected to that overwhelmingly innocuous [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=229.58s)]
*  goal. The argument of the RFK Jr. campaign so far as a coherent one can be discerned [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=238.46s)]
*  is that he was taking on establishment, interest establishment dogma, in particular, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=246.3s)]
*  in the national security sphere. RFK Jr. said himself that his top issues are the Ukraine War [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=252.78s)]
*  and free speech. And that's what led him to forge this alliance with Trump. On the Ukraine War, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=260.7s)]
*  he was running around flamboyantly denouncing Trump for being partially responsible for causing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=266.3s)]
*  the Ukraine War and being unrepentant about it because Trump still, to this day, has never [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=271.42s)]
*  stopped bragging about arming Ukraine, which he did and went further than even the Obama [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=277.42s)]
*  administration had did. RFK Jr. was denouncing him for that. On the issue of free speech, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=282.14s)]
*  I don't know if I don't know. I mean, RFK Jr. and Trump, they may have bonded over their shared [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=287.58000000000004s)]
*  pro-Israel fanaticism. I'm not sure because on the issue of speech, Trump is gallivanting around [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=292.3s)]
*  with Miriam Adelson, boasting about how he is going to use the coercive power of the state [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=299.5s)]
*  to crack down on so-called anti-Semitic speech. So maybe RFK Jr. loves that. And that's part of his [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=306.7s)]
*  whole conception of free speech. I'm not sure. But the point is, if the focal point of his campaign [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=312.06s)]
*  was just this issue of removing toxins from the soil, I mean, I don't think you would have found [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=319.58s)]
*  many people to object to that. It went so much further. In terms of the three issues that he raised, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=326.14s)]
*  the Make America Healthy Again agenda, whatever you want to call it, that's been up there just [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=332.94s)]
*  as much as free speech. And I don't want to have any kind of delusions about this, as you mentioned, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=338.38s)]
*  delusions. The Trump administration was very bad on this. The Obama administration had moved into [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=346.06s)]
*  place to ban chlorpyrifos. We spray millions of tons of this in California and other states that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=351.66s)]
*  grow a lot of fruits. It's a neurotoxin. It's linked to autism. It's linked to neurological [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=357.02s)]
*  problems in children and pregnant women. The federal government, the EPA, was moving towards [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=364.14s)]
*  banning tri-chloroethylene, which is a cleaning product that's actually fatal. People have died [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=371.5s)]
*  from this. It's used at dry cleaners. The Trump administration rolled that back. What did the Trump [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=376.38s)]
*  administration bring in to run these vital agencies, the FDA, the CDC, the EPA? I mean, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=381.42s)]
*  it was just tons and tons of industry lobbyists, the top lobbyists for the American Chemistry [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=389.82s)]
*  Council, which represents the entire chemical industry. The top lobbyist, Nancy Beck, was [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=394.86s)]
*  brought into the Trump administration to regulate her previous clients. Look, I want to be perfectly [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=400.62s)]
*  clear that, as hopeful as I am, that a lot of these vital issues that RFK is talking about in [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=407.18s)]
*  terms of healthy food, pesticides, processed foods, I think either candidate needs to be talking [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=413.98s)]
*  about it, and the fact that he's elevating it as one of his top issues is vital. But yeah, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=421.1s)]
*  I mean, there's a big inconsistency there. The question is whether Trump can incorporate some [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=425.42s)]
*  of this because it's now part of his base. This is really, if you talk to RFK supporters, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=430.38s)]
*  this is a top line issue. This is what really I think is a very vital part of his appeal. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=434.86s)]
*  Can he kind of change the mix of what a future Trump, EPA, or CDC might look like? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=442.3s)]
*  I don't know, but I think that's one reason not to be completely cynical. And look, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=449.34s)]
*  politicians change over time. If you look at certain Bernie surrogates back in 2020, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=454.78s)]
*  certain left-wing publications that you and I both read, they were claiming that Biden, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  given his history of cutting social security, or at least supporting cuts to social security, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=464.94s)]
*  the fact that he was advised by people like Bruce Reed, this Clinton administration, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=469.58s)]
*  democratic establishment figure who's been behind many of the big plans to cut and winnow down [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=473.82s)]
*  entitlement programs, they were predicting that a Biden administration would mean big cuts [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=479.26s)]
*  to social security or Medicare. Well, that didn't happen because the political dynamics changed. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=484.06s)]
*  There were claims that he would never pull out of Afghanistan given his kind of more military [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=489.02s)]
*  establishment friendly appointees. Well, Biden pulled out of Afghanistan. So look, I just want [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=494.22s)]
*  to keep a little bit of an open mind without being naive about the political realities here. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=500.22s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I'm going to be stubbornly unhopeful because with such blatant deceit, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=505.58s)]
*  it's hard for me to say, oh, I'm going to look for the silver linings of the egregious deceit. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=514.3s)]
*  And let's just give you one example of this. We actually do have a graphic here. Pull up this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=519.82s)]
*  RFK Jr. tweet from September 30th. This is number 230. I'm talking to the producers right now, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=523.9s)]
*  just so maybe you could see it on the screen. This is him, RFK Jr. saying, don't you think you [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=533.1s)]
*  deserve a president who's going to make peace in the world? This is him talking about Trump. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=540.46s)]
*  And then let's go to Donald Trump like two or three days later at an event in Fayetteville, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  North Carolina. We have the clip. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=552.06s)]
*  Do we have the clip? This is video to Trump in Fayetteville, North Carolina, like two or [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=560.9399999999999s)]
*  three days after this tweet, that tweet from RFK Jr. They asked him, what do you think about [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=564.78s)]
*  the, what do you think about Iran? Would you hit Iran? And he goes, as long as they don't hit the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=572.94s)]
*  nuclear stuff. That's the thing you want to hit, right? I said, I think he's got that one wrong. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=578.78s)]
*  Isn't that the one you're supposed to hit? I mean, it's the biggest risk we have. Nuclear weapons, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=585.1800000000001s)]
*  the power of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. You know, I rebuilt the entire [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=592.22s)]
*  military, Jeff's everything. I built it, including nuclear. And I hated to build the nuclear, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=596.38s)]
*  but I got to know firsthand the power of that stuff. And I'll tell you what, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  we have to be totally prepared. We have to be absolutely prepared. But when they asked [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=608.06s)]
*  that question, the answer should have been hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=612.2199999999999s)]
*  And that's what I said. If they're going to do it, if they're going to do it, they're going to do it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=617.66s)]
*  But we'll find out what they're planning to do. But great question. Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=623.1s)]
*  Okay. So that's Trump repeatedly saying that Israel ought to strike Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=630.5400000000001s)]
*  That same week, it was reported that he made a phone call to Netanyahu in Israeli. This was [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=636.46s)]
*  reported only in Israeli media. I haven't seen it really reported anywhere in American media, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=643.5s)]
*  but Israeli media reported that Trump made a personal phone call to Netanyahu who he had [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=647.5s)]
*  supposedly had a falling out with in the past. Now apparently they've mended their ties and [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=652.94s)]
*  congratulated Netanyahu on invading Lebanon. Before Israel invaded Lebanon, Jared Kushner put out [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=658.94s)]
*  a tweet or a message calling for Israel to invade Lebanon. Kushner's still a proxy for Trump, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=668.38s)]
*  essentially, as far as I could tell. When I interviewed Trump's co-chair for his transition [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=675.9s)]
*  at the vice presidential debate, you may have seen this, Lee Howard-Lutnick, he told me directly that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=682.22s)]
*  Jared Kushner is going to be helping staff a second Trump administration. Why this should be [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=687.26s)]
*  surprising to anyone, I'm not sure. I mean, did anybody think that Kushner was going to be [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=692.4599999999999s)]
*  out of business? That never seemed plausible to me, but there you have it from the horse's mouth. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=696.86s)]
*  So I guess this gets to why I'm kind of more resolutely cynical here. On the one hand, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=701.5s)]
*  you have RFK Jr. and others who maybe we don't have to name going around declaring that Trump [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=708.22s)]
*  is going to bring peace to the world while he's literally calling for Israel to bomb Iranian [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=715.02s)]
*  nuclear facilities. He has also said stuff to the effect of what the Biden administration should be [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=721.66s)]
*  doing right now is threatening to bomb the entire country of Iran into, quote, smithereens, rain down [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=729.98s)]
*  bombs just on all their major cities. And you have Robert F. Kennedy Jr. saying this is the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=736.46s)]
*  peaceful message that harkens back to the incredible legacy of his martyred uncle and father. I mean, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=742.46s)]
*  this is just idiocy. This is like absurd propaganda, is it not? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=747.26s)]
*  It is actually an accurate representation of the Kennedy legacy in the sense that JFK lied. He [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=753.6600000000001s)]
*  lied about a missile gap. He basically mobilized a new red scare around the 1960 election to say [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=762.22s)]
*  that we're at risk of being bombarded by all these advanced Soviet nuclear missiles. And we really [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=770.38s)]
*  didn't have the technology to keep up that the Eisenhower and the Nixon previous administration [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=778.5400000000001s)]
*  had not invested enough in the military. And it was all basically a lie. The subsequent reporting [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=783.1800000000001s)]
*  showed that the Soviets had no massive buildup of advanced missile ICBMs and nuclear weapons. It was [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=789.6600000000001s)]
*  all kind of to whip the public into a panic so that he could be elected. And a lot of his rhetoric [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=796.3000000000001s)]
*  during his administration about being the peace candidate and getting a [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=802.94s)]
*  peace for our time, the speech at American University, was kind of window dressing for [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=807.82s)]
*  a very interventionist militaristic agenda. So look, no disagreements there. And if anything, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=813.5s)]
*  just to kind of continue the 1960s parallel here, Trump sounds like 1968 Nixon, right? Nixon spoke [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=819.34s)]
*  out of both sides of his mouth. He kind of attacked the Johnson administration for not doing enough [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=827.82s)]
*  against the communists while kind of floating this vague, euphemistic, a secret peace deal that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=832.62s)]
*  he could reach with the North Vietnamese. In fact, his surrogates were doing everything they could [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=839.58s)]
*  to kill a peace deal with Hanoi. He wanted to prolong the war. And then, of course, when he [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=845.34s)]
*  got into office, rather than a secret peace deal that he had promised on the campaign trail, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=850.78s)]
*  he started a legal bombing campaign of Cambodia, escalated the secret dirty war in Laos, escalated [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=855.18s)]
*  American involvement in Vietnam directly, killed hundreds of thousands of civilians unnecessarily, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=863.1s)]
*  really kind of grim political dynamic around deceiving American media and the American public [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=869.66s)]
*  around his plan for ending the Vietnam War. He, in fact, only escalated it. Trump's rhetoric around [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=876.78s)]
*  Iran, Israel, Lebanon has been terrifying, frankly, and really kind of breaks from his very refreshing [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=882.94s)]
*  views in the 2015-2016 Republican primary when he was a very lonely and populist voice against the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=890.94s)]
*  Bush neoconservative agenda and just pilloring every other candidate for their military and [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=898.3800000000001s)]
*  interventionist views. It was very refreshing, whether you're a Democrat, Republican, or [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=906.7s)]
*  Independent, to hear any kind of candidate talk that way. We're used to the uniparty [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=910.7s)]
*  rhetoric on threat escalation from all of America's supposed adversaries, the need to [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=917.1800000000001s)]
*  spend more and intervene more and talking about the risk of terrorism. Trump was very frank and [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=923.26s)]
*  I think reflected the sentiment that most Americans feel about that never-ending wars. And here he is, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=932.0600000000001s)]
*  kind of just sounding sort of like a more bombastic Jeb Bush in terms of having launched [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=938.14s)]
*  us into a new war with Iran, which again, if we actually strike Iran, if we assist [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=944.94s)]
*  Israel with striking Iran's nuclear facilities and its civilian infrastructure and oil [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=951.5s)]
*  infrastructure, that's a regime change war. That's a new regional war across the Middle East. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=956.7s)]
*  Yeah, and my problem with the whole RFK Jr. conceit at this point is that he's [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=964.46s)]
*  legitimating this policy program as somehow reflecting a heroic opposition to the so-called [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=969.6600000000001s)]
*  deep state or military industrial complex. I mean, I'm a stickler for what politicians actually do [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=977.82s)]
*  when they obtain power. Trump said all kinds of things in 2015, 2016. In fact, famously, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=984.62s)]
*  although in 2015 he was hectoring people like Marco Rubio for being puppets of Sheldon Adelson, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=993.1800000000001s)]
*  once he began to shore up the Republican presidential nomination, he ran right into the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1000.38s)]
*  arms of Adelson and started accepting his largesse, went to the APAC conference and recited all the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1005.82s)]
*  standard talking points. And then although he had promised in 2015, so early in the primary season, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1010.86s)]
*  that if he were president, he would come up with a deal of all deals to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1018.3s)]
*  conflict. What did he do? He became the most deferential possible president to Israel, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1024.22s)]
*  and now he's running on a platform where he and the Republicans are denouncing Biden and [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1031.8999999999999s)]
*  Harris for somehow being in hoc to Hamas or pandering to anti-Semites despite the Biden-Harris [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1037.8999999999999s)]
*  administration providing more military support to Israel than literally any president ever in [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1045.82s)]
*  terms of sheer quantity of material. Well, I just want to say what underpins, I think, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1051.1s)]
*  this entire discussion is our winner-take-all system. I'm skeptical of anyone who just kind of [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1062.46s)]
*  blindly supports any third-party candidate in our current system. There is a way that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1069.74s)]
*  conforms with our constitution to change the way we award the electoral college and those votes [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1076.94s)]
*  in a way that actually might boost a third-party candidacy that actually opens up the map so [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1084.54s)]
*  candidates have to compete all over the country. We could be, instead of doing this winner-take-all [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1091.26s)]
*  system where each state does it based on whoever gets the plurality of votes, we could have it by [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1095.66s)]
*  congressional district, we could have it by proportional voting. There's a way that opens [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1101.98s)]
*  this system up so that we'd have multiple candidates, multiple parties. We don't have [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1106.78s)]
*  that. We have a winner-take-all system that just mathematically benefits two candidates, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1111.9s)]
*  and the two candidates we have are both competing to be militaristic in terms of Israel and Iran. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1118.78s)]
*  They're competing to please the interests of whatever you want to call it, the deep state or [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1124.54s)]
*  the military industrial complex in terms of arming these countries and escalating the war. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1129.42s)]
*  For any third-party candidate operating in this system, in a winner-take-all system, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1138.06s)]
*  they essentially benefit one of the two incumbent parties. This never really made sense. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1142.7s)]
*  Third-party candidates, just as Ross Perot had an opportunity to really run as a singular figure, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1151.3400000000001s)]
*  at the end of the day, his candidacy probably just boosted Bill Clinton because he drained [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1159.0200000000002s)]
*  votes from Bush. That's how it shakes out in all these- [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1163.1000000000001s)]
*  I think there's differing interpretations, actually, of Ross Perot's electoral effect. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1166.5400000000002s)]
*  There are maybe certain regions of the country where he did disadvantage Bush, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1174.3000000000002s)]
*  but others where he could have disadvantaged Clinton. It's kind of a toss-up, but I take the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1179.74s)]
*  point about the overall impact of third parties on the electoral system as it's currently [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1185.74s)]
*  constituted. It's not like you have a parliamentary system where a third party can officially join, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1192.4599999999998s)]
*  or a minor party can officially join in terms of parliamentary power. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1197.02s)]
*  Well, if one of the major parties, then you actually have official leverage rather than [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1201.02s)]
*  de facto leverage that people are hoping RFK might exert. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1207.26s)]
*  And then once you form a government, the coalition building is relatively transparent. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1209.34s)]
*  If you want to form a coalition with the Greens, then you have to adopt one of their positions, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1215.42s)]
*  or you have to adopt one of their ministers as a key position in your government, and the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1219.5s)]
*  trade-off is very clear to the public. Here, it's left up to people like you and me to guess, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1224.3s)]
*  really, to get leaks and to get hints about is there actually a real trade-off or is it just [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1230.22s)]
*  being hoodwinked? It's not clear. And in our system, there's less transparency. It's all [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1235.58s)]
*  horse trading, but none of that horse trading really makes sense. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1242.62s)]
*  Yeah. So your point about there potentially being parallels to 1960 is really interesting. I [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1247.34s)]
*  hadn't given that one much thought, but I should mull it over. I was more thinking about 1960, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1253.02s)]
*  especially since we're being told that JFK is somehow analogous to Trump, I guess, maybe [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1258.86s)]
*  because they've both been shot at. That's the basis of the parallel that people want to cling [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1263.98s)]
*  to, which fair enough, I guess that happens to be true, although Reagan was shot as well. I mean, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1268.6200000000001s)]
*  doesn't matter. But the 1968 point is interesting. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8_USNc81c&t=1272.94s)]
