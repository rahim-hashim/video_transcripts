# Scandal at Washington Post Involving Neocon Max Boot and his Accused Spy-Wife
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y)
*  Max Boot is one of the worst people in the Washington media and has been for many, many [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  years. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=11.28s)]
*  He's like David from or Bill Kristol or people of that kind, just an absolute fanatical sociopathic, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  bloodthirsty neocon who has cheered every single ward the United States has not only fought, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=17.48s)]
*  but proposed to fight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=21.92s)]
*  He constantly is holding himself as this powerful, strong figure talking about strength all the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=23.72s)]
*  time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=29.36s)]
*  He's never gotten anywhere near combat or fighting in combat. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=30.36s)]
*  He loves to send Americans and their families and other people's kids and people and their [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=34.08s)]
*  families and other countries to go fight and die in the wars that he then runs to a column [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  and speaks in this Churchillian way about the glory of the conflict so that he can feel [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=46.16s)]
*  righteous and powerful to compensate for his internal weakness. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=50.84s)]
*  Just one of those kind of neocons, very, very standard. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=54.84s)]
*  But what he also is is somebody like most neocons who the minute you question their [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=59.12s)]
*  wars and say, wait a minute, why are we going to this war? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=63.12s)]
*  Why should we go to war in this country? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=65.88s)]
*  Will accuse you of being an agent of that foreign country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=67.96s)]
*  It's not that you disagree about whether the US should fight the war. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=72.72s)]
*  It's that you must be a sympathizer of Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein or Muammar Gaddafi [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=75.64s)]
*  or Bashar al-Assad or Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=82.2s)]
*  And the reason why Max Boot went from being a hardcore Republican in the Bush years to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=87.76s)]
*  now being an overt Democrat and a hater of Donald Trump is because he spent so many years [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  insisting and writing that he had no question that Donald Trump was a secret agent, a spy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  or agent of the Russian government even being paid or blackmailed to do it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, there was no evidence for that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  Robert Mueller after 18 months barely alluded to that theory, let alone affirmed it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=116.64s)]
*  So but that's his tactic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=123.0s)]
*  He's called me a Russian agent before or working for the Russian government, Tucker, Carl's, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=124.24s)]
*  many other people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  That's what he does all the time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=128.92s)]
*  As it turns out, he does know someone very well who was an actual secret agent and spy [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=129.92s)]
*  for a foreign government. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=138.76s)]
*  This is his wife who just got indicted by the US Justice Department in a very detailed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=142.2s)]
*  affidavit for secretly working as an agent of the South Korean government, helping South [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=149.0s)]
*  Korean spies infiltrate the United States government and using her access to US media [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=154.28s)]
*  to disseminate South Korean propaganda for pay that she never disclosed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=159.88s)]
*  Here from the New York Times on Monday, quote, the US accuses a former CIA analyst of working [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=165.16s)]
*  for South Korea. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=171.56s)]
*  Obviously, Matt Boots wife is a former CIA analyst. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=172.56s)]
*  Quote, Sumi Terry, a North Korea expert with the Council on Foreign Affairs, was charged [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=176.24s)]
*  with acting as an agent for Seoul after leaving the intelligence agency. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  Sumi Terry, a prominent voice on American foreign policy, had a refined palette, a love [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=186.44s)]
*  for top shelf sushi and a taste for designer labels. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=192.4s)]
*  She likes coats by Christian Dior, handbags by Blotega Vetna and Louis Vuitton, and Michelin [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=196.4s)]
*  starred restaurants. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  And according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, she accepted such luxury goods and other gifts [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  in exchange for serving the South Korean government in Seoul. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=209.16s)]
*  Ms. Terry, a former CIA analyst and a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=213.24s)]
*  Foreign Relations, is accused in a 31 page indictment, remember by the Biden Justice [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=217.52s)]
*  Department, released Tuesday of a years long effort to assist South Korean spies. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=223.16s)]
*  The indictment says she even introduced the spies to congressional staff members and an [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=229.6s)]
*  action that she described as quote, bringing the wolf in. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  She was bringing the wolf into the most sensitive areas of the US government and she married [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=239.84s)]
*  Max Boot, who has a lot of access in Washington. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=246.72s)]
*  Quote, in Ms. Terry's case, prosecutors said she began operating as a foreign agent in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=250.11999999999998s)]
*  2013, five years after leaving the CIA. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=254.83999999999997s)]
*  She was first contacted by an intelligence officer posting as a diplomat for the Korean [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=257.68s)]
*  mission to the UN in New York City. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=261.84s)]
*  The indictment said in return for her work over the next decade, Ms. Terry received handbags, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=263.96s)]
*  clothing and at least $37,000 in covert payments to the think tank where she was employed at [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=269.4s)]
*  the time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=277.28s)]
*  During the indictment, federal agents had suspicions regarding Ms. Terry's contact with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  Seoul as recently as November 2014 when the FBI called her in for a voluntary interview. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=281.76s)]
*  Over the ensuing years, agents would track Ms. Terry to numerous restaurants and luxury [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=288.88s)]
*  stores in Washington, providing photos of her dining with her handlers and standing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=292.88s)]
*  next to them at cash registers as they bought her expensive goods. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=297.64s)]
*  Several were included in court papers Tuesday. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=302.08s)]
*  Ms. Terry's activities on behalf of South Korea started small and became more ambitious [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=305.16s)]
*  as she worked with three different handlers, the indictment said. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=310.12s)]
*  At first, she mainly published opinion articles favorable to South Korea's stance on North [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=313.04s)]
*  Korea, but soon she was facilitating meetings between incoming Trump administration officials [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  and South Korea intelligence agencies in 2016. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  By 2018, Ms. Terry was hosting meetings at a think tank at the request of her South Korean [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  handlers, giving them access to U.S. national security officials, the indictment said. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=332.72s)]
*  This is so ironic, isn't it? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=339.72s)]
*  That Max Boot has spent 20 years, intensively and incessantly accusing people of being secret [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  agents, undisclosed secret agents for foreign governments when they disagree with him and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=351.24s)]
*  all alone, all along, the woman next to whom he was sleeping and to whom he's married [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=354.88000000000005s)]
*  was herself, actually, what he accused everybody else of being. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=359.96s)]
*  And it's not just that it's his wife. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=365.96s)]
*  It's somebody who he helped get into the Washington Post where he's a columnist, someone with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=368.56s)]
*  whom he co-wrote Washington Post articles and co-wrote Washington Post articles not [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  only about the government she was serving and getting payments from criminally, according [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  to the DOJ, but he co-wrote articles with her that did nothing but push the propaganda [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=383.52s)]
*  of the South Korean government, including an article that the indictment explicitly [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=390.96s)]
*  cited as ones where she called up her handlers and said, I need to get instructions on what [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=394.84s)]
*  we're supposed to say in this article. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  One of those is this article in the Washington Post. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=404.29999999999995s)]
*  It's co-bylined by Max Booth and Sumi Terry. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=406.56s)]
*  And the headline is, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=413.64s)]
*  the nascent trilateral relationship is the best possible answer to China, referring [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=414.48s)]
*  to an alliance between the United States, Japan, and South Korea bolstering this alliance [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=420.36s)]
*  that obviously is in South Korea's interest. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  Cooperation grows regarding economic security, intelligence, sharing, and military readiness. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=428.92s)]
*  And it goes on to argue that not only is it vital that the United States continue to arm [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  with South Korea, but warning that Donald Trump is a danger to the alliance because [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=440.32s)]
*  he sees South Korea as just this waste of money where we pour billions of dollars into [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  it in exchange for nothing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=451.9s)]
*  And so he's trying to defeat Donald Trump on behalf of South Korea. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  Now after this indictment came out, the Washington Post has continued to promote Max Booth's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=458.52s)]
*  articles as though nothing had happened. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  And I and others raised our voices and said, how can you just ignore this, Washington Post? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=465.98s)]
*  You have articles in your paper that, according to the DOJ, were basically written by South [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=470.22s)]
*  Korean intelligence agents and given to Sumi Terry, the co-author, in exchange for pay. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=476.22s)]
*  And you presented it as though it was a legitimate, valid expression of opinion. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=483.92s)]
*  And so finally, in response to all this pressure, they finally put an editor's note on top of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=489.44s)]
*  not just this article, but every other one that she wrote, including she co-wrote with [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=494.24s)]
*  Max Booth that says the following, quote, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=498.2s)]
*  Editor's note, July 18th, 2024. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=501.14s)]
*  On July 16th, a federal indictment was made public alleging that Sumi Terry had acted [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  as an unregistered agent of the South Korean government beginning in 2013. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=508.28s)]
*  If true, this information, this is information that would have been pertinent for the post [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  publication decision. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=517.36s)]
*  Oh, do you think? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=518.36s)]
*  Ms. Terry has denied these charges and has asserted through counsel that the allegations [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=520.4s)]
*  in the indictment are unfounded. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=524.78s)]
*  But here's the kind of thing they were writing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=528.4599999999999s)]
*  Max Booth and his ex-CIA wife is now accused of being a criminal spy for the government [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=529.98s)]
*  of South Korea. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=534.74s)]
*  This was just a couple months ago, May 27th, 2024, quote, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  A pro-American trilateral alignment is the best possible answer to the menace posed by [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  the anti-American trilateral alignment of China, Russia, and North Korea. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=546.24s)]

*  by changes of leadership in those countries, although it has little to do with the trilateral [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=557.26s)]
*  relationship, Biden, Yun, and Kishida are all unpopular, meaning the three leaders of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=561.3s)]
*  the United States, Japan, and South Korea. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=566.78s)]
*  A Trump return to the White House, they argued, on the house of the South Korean government, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=568.62s)]
*  and the Washington Post, would be a serious setback for the United States systems of alliances [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=576.22s)]
*  and the trilateral relationship as no exception. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=582.36s)]
*  This is the kind of foreign interference in our government, in our elections, that people [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  like Max Booth and everyone else, including the Washington Post, has been warning of when [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=594.44s)]
*  it came to Donald Trump, even though it ended up being false. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=599.96s)]
*  This article, that according to the O.J. was actually just a disguised propaganda article [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=603.58s)]
*  by the South Korean government to manipulate our elections, goes on, quote, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=609.4000000000001s)]
*  Trump is obsessed with the cost of defending South Korea without considering all of the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=613.4000000000001s)]
*  benefits... [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=618.82s)]
*  Can we put this next thing up? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=619.82s)]
*  Trump is obsessed with the cost of defending South Korea without considering all of the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=621.98s)]
*  benefits that accrue from a close relationship with the world's 13th largest economy and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=625.74s)]
*  a stalwart liberal democracy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=630.7s)]
*  As president, Trump demanded that South Korea increase its subsidies for the U.S. troop [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=632.54s)]
*  presence to more than $1 billion a year, but he still isn't satisfied. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=637.3399999999999s)]
*  Just to be clear, Trump's point of view is that South Korea is a booming, thriving economy, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=643.86s)]
*  and their citizens have a higher standard of living than millions of Americans. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=650.48s)]
*  And so Trump's argument is, why are we paying to protect you when you're not contributing [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=655.4599999999999s)]
*  economically at all? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=661.92s)]
*  We're paying for everything. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=662.92s)]
*  And he forced them to increase the amount of subsidies like he's trying to do with NATO. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=663.92s)]
*  And Max Putin is spying his spy wife, his ex-CIA wife, who's accused of being a spy [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=669.4s)]
*  by the DOJ on behalf of South Korea, is here to say that Trump is evil for even pressuring [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=675.0799999999999s)]
*  the South Korean government to do anything. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=679.4s)]
*  Quote, sounding a refrain he has echoed consistently since at least 1990, Trump told Time magazine [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  in April, quote, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  Trump previously suspended joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=688.84s)]
*  In the future, he is unlikely to fund trilateral exercises. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=701.4s)]
*  Little wonder that during a recent trip to North Korea, we found considerable anxiety [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=706.2s)]
*  in both countries about the prospect of another Trump term. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=711.2800000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration is now in the midst of talks with South Korea on a new cost-sharing [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=715.8s)]
*  agreement for U.S. forces in the hope of reaching a deal before Trump can return to office. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=719.52s)]
*  All three leaders would do well to act urgently right now to lock in the trilateral process. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  This is nothing more than an article demanding that the United States give as much money [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=729.64s)]
*  to South Korea and to pay for all their defense and not ask them to do anything more by a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=734.1999999999999s)]
*  spy for the South Korean government, according to the DOJ, who's partnering with her husband [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=739.4799999999999s)]
*  Max Boot to be able to launder those South Korean government talking points in the Washington [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=745.76s)]
*  Post, even though her husband is somebody who goes around incessantly accusing anyone [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=750.68s)]
*  who raises doubt or questions about his views of being a spy or an agent for Russia or whatever. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=758.4s)]
*  It's not just in the Washington Post where she wrote, she also wrote in the New York [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=766.36s)]
*  Times this article from 2014, Let North Korea Collapse, where she said, so far, the United [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=768.96s)]
*  States, South Korea, Japan, and China, the main countries of the stake on the Korean [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=775.72s)]
*  Peninsula have responded by adopting a policy of soft containment. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=780.32s)]
*  Even as they have tried to curb North Korea's excesses, they have allowed the regime to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=785.1600000000001s)]
*  stay in place. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=788.12s)]
*  They fear that its demise would be too destabilizing and that the peninsula's reunification would [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=789.12s)]
*  mean crippling economic and social costs for South Korea. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=794.36s)]
*  But this is a blinkered view because the long-term benefits of North Korea's collapse, both strategic [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=797.88s)]
*  and economic, far outweigh short-term costs. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=802.48s)]
*  So she's essentially arguing here that the U.S. engage in regime change against the government [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=807.72s)]
*  of North Korea, a government with a vast stockpile of dangerous nuclear weapons in order to benefit [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=812.64s)]
*  South Korea. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=818.4s)]
*  Now, one of the really fascinating parts of this story, because I'm sure the New York [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=819.4s)]
*  Times and the Washington Post are going to say we had no idea, is that there is this [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=825.6s)]
*  satirical account on Twitter that's been around for quite a while under the name Richard M. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=831.12s)]
*  Nixon. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=835.68s)]
*  It's at Dick Nixon and sort of gives voice to or tries to channel Nixon's thought process. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=837.7199999999999s)]
*  And yet in 2014, June 16, 2014, more than 10 years ago, this account directed this [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=847.12s)]
*  tweet to Sumitari, Max Boot's wife, now accused of being a spy. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=857.08s)]
*  And he said, following, quote, how much did the South Korean intelligence service pay [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=861.88s)]
*  you to write that trash in the Times? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=866.12s)]
*  The trash saying, oh, we should let the North Korean government collapse, we should help [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=870.6800000000001s)]
*  it fall, and then reunify it all under South Korea. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=873.4s)]
*  How did this account know that she was getting paid by South Korean intelligence to publish [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=879.02s)]
*  insane pro-South Korea propaganda in the New York Times and yet the New York Times and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=885.16s)]
*  the Washington Post didn't know? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=890.36s)]
*  This is from 2014, that tweet. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=892.4399999999999s)]
*  Just to underscore this story, here from the Washington Post, Max Boot, and I could show [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=898.12s)]
*  you articles like this all night, January 13, 2019, here are 18 reasons Trump could [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  be a Russian asset. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  Imagine you're married to an asset of a foreign government and you go around accusing other [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=913.76s)]
*  people of that with no evidence while you're next to and co-authoring with a woman who [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=919.52s)]
*  actually is your wife. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=924.64s)]
*  He says, quote, this is hardly beyond a reasonable doubt case that Trump is a Russian agent, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=928.72s)]
*  certainly not in the way that Robert Hanson or Aldrich Ames were, but it is a strong circumstantial [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=934.24s)]
*  case that Trump is, as former acting CIA director Michael Morrell and former CIA director [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=939.18s)]
*  Michael Hayden warned during the 2016 campaign, quote, an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=944.9799999999999s)]
*  or a useful tool who is manipulated by Moscow. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=950.4s)]
*  If Trump isn't actually a Russian agent, he is doing a pretty good imitation of one. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=954.02s)]
*  I mean, who would know better than Max Boot? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=959.5799999999999s)]
*  And then here he is on CNN doing the same thing. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=966.3s)]
*  There you see the caption on CNN, 18 reasons why Trump may be a Russian agent. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=970.5s)]
*  Financial ties to Russia, election hack to favor Trump. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=975.8199999999999s)]
*  All the Russia, if you're listening, 101 contacts, Carter Page, Paul Manafort, all the crap, the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=979.42s)]
*  conspiracy theories, the falsified conspiracy theories that dominated our discourse for [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=986.62s)]
*  years drowned our politics in it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=990.42s)]
*  A CIA, FBI false conspiracy theory laundered through the Washington Post, the New York [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=993.5s)]
*  Times, they gave themselves Pulitzers for it, designed to destroy the Trump presidency. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=997.98s)]
*  And here is Max Boot on CNN accusing Trump of likely being a Russian agent, while his [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1002.78s)]
*  wife was actually that for South Korea the entire time. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1008.74s)]
*  I mean, like I said, the universe is rarely this just. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1013.62s)]
*  You rarely see karmic justice so satisfying, so perfect. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1018.54s)]
*  I mean, imagine someone telling you three years ago that it's going to turn out that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1025.78s)]
*  Max Boot's own wife is a criminally concealed agent of a foreign power while his whole career [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1030.34s)]
*  is based on accusing others of that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1037.86s)]
*  And that he co-wrote op-eds with her. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1040.98s)]
*  He brought her into the Washington Post to put his own name on these articles that the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1042.8s)]
*  the GEO say says were part of the criminal scheme. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1046.58s)]
*  How can Max Boot just say it the Washington Post? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1052.46s)]
*  I mean, I get that these are accusations, but certainly some response to this huge [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1055.02s)]
*  journalist scandal on the part of the Washington Post and on the part of Max Boot, and it's [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NplRRNXj4Y&t=1061.26s)]
