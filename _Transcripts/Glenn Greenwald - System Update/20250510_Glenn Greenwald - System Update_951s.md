# Yanis Varoufakis: Why Trump's Tariffs Won't Save Blue-Collar Workers
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ)
*  Let me move to tariffs because I really want to understand. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We would have to spend the whole show on tariffs to really understand your views. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=11.0s)]
*  It's a complicated topic, but I just want to ask you this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=14.56s)]
*  As long as I can remember, as long as I've been paying attention to politics, free trade [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  has been the bugaboo of the left in the United States and in Europe. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=21.32s)]
*  The 1999 protests at the World Trade Organization in Seattle was a major moment where people [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  understood they were being victimized by things like NAFTA and World Trade. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=32.92s)]
*  It's the reason the left hates the Clintons because they've been pushing free trade policies [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=37.36s)]
*  and blame NAFTA and blame the Clintons for deindustrialization of the United States, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=41.6s)]
*  which a lot of people warned about, including on the populist right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=45.0s)]
*  But mostly this has been a view on the left. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=47.56s)]
*  As a result, tariffs have been a way to push back against this, the tyranny of free trade, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=51.52s)]
*  the destruction of free trade. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=57.28s)]
*  Here you have Donald Trump coming and making that case. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=59.28s)]
*  He's the one who's saying free trade screws over the United States in the way that you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  described, but also these countries that drown our country in cheap products is what is eliminating [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=66.08s)]
*  these jobs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=73.64s)]
*  We want to reinstitute nationalist economics that will serve our people and not to be dependent [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=74.64s)]
*  on these cheap supply chains that destroy our economy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=81.28s)]
*  I understand why people like you find horrific this arbitrary chart that gets created or [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=84.76s)]
*  treating trade deficits as a tariff or proof that there's some injustice going on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=90.0s)]
*  Even the danger that he's only doing this so that he can then have companies come to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  him and beg for exemptions in exchange for some favors that he gets or people around [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=101.28s)]
*  him get, I understand all that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=105.4s)]
*  But just directionally, in terms of saying free trade doesn't work, the system of free [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=107.04s)]
*  trade only benefits the elites and not the American worker, and we need to get away from [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  that because it's the only way we can recover the working class, is there any positives [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=117.04s)]
*  that you see in that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=120.78s)]
*  Yes, there is. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  I surprised you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=124.84s)]
*  Yes, there is. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=127.68s)]
*  Trump or his team more like it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=130.24s)]
*  People like Scott Besson and Stephen Miran who are smart and they understand economics [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  and finance, they put their finger on the parts of the problem or one of the main problems. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  The fact that the American rentier class, essentially financiers and realtors, of whom [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  of course the Donald is one, they have been enriching themselves because not in spite [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=154.8s)]
*  of because of the burgeoning trade deficit of the United States, which is the other side, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=161.28s)]
*  the flip side of the same coin as that of American manufacturing decline and the industrialization. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  On this they're right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=176.32s)]
*  It's been my analysis now for 40 years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=177.68s)]
*  I've written books about that well before I knew who Donald Trump was. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=181.16s)]
*  The tragedy is that the remedy that they're offering through bilateral mafia-like negotiations [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  were first with Britain, then with India, then with Germany and so on and so forth, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  that is not going to work out well in the end for the people that are voting them in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=200.32s)]
*  only because for once they heard something that is remotely connected to the reality. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=205.44s)]
*  Of course the people who voted them in are the blue collar workers, the MAGA crowd between [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=212.92s)]
*  the two coasts, the East and the West Coast of the United States. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  That's the first point. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  The second point, let me speak to what you said about the opposition of the left to free [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  trade. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=230.92s)]
*  Well, to begin with, there was never free trade. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=231.92s)]
*  We never had free trade. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  It was predatory trade. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=235.76s)]
*  And let me remind you, Glenn, you don't need to be reminded, but just in case somebody from [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=237.76s)]
*  our audience needs to be reminded or has forgotten, what were these multilateral trade agreements? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=241.4s)]
*  TTP, TTIP and all that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=251.4s)]
*  You remember these, CETA, these huge trade liberalization negotiation rounds, which some [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=253.4s)]
*  of them led to agreements, some of them failed. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=262.36s)]
*  This was not about freeing trade. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=265.8s)]
*  It was about establishing the ultimate authority and power of multinational corporations to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=268.04s)]
*  come to my country, to come to your country and to say you cannot have a public health [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  system. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  You cannot sell pharmaceuticals below a certain price. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  You cannot protect your environment because this will be considered according to the free [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=286.6s)]
*  trade agreement, some kind of unequal, uneven playing field. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=291.76s)]
*  So it was never about free trade. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=297.48s)]
*  Now tariffs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=300.72s)]
*  If you look very carefully at not at what Donald says, but what his men say, Besant, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=302.36s)]
*  Miran and the rest, Katz, what they are saying is that, and I think that they believe it, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  I think they're being honest on this, that tariffs are not an end in themselves. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=315.76s)]
*  Tariffs are a means for rebalancing the world economy. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=321.16s)]
*  Now, if they succeeded in rebalancing the world economy, I would be all for them. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=325.72s)]
*  I don't think they will. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=330.04s)]
*  But the idea that they are putting forward is this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  You impose sky high tariffs upon everyone, not because you want to keep them there, but [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=334.48s)]
*  because you want to scare the living daylights out of them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=340.8s)]
*  And then they come to you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=344.24s)]
*  And then the world resembles a bicycle wheel with the hub being the United States or Trump [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=346.12s)]
*  and his team and every other country or economic block being a spoke on that bicycle wheel. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=353.04s)]
*  So even if two or three of those spokes are broken, that is, there is no deal with them, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=358.04s)]
*  it doesn't matter. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=362.04s)]
*  They will still turn and works. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=363.04s)]
*  But they don't talk to one another. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=365.76s)]
*  So no multilateral negotiations and so on and so forth in case they bind together against [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=367.44s)]
*  the hub, against the United States. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=372.88s)]
*  So we will slap these immense tariffs upon them. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=374.96s)]
*  And then they will come each one at a time to us and we will demand from them very specific [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  things. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=386.72s)]
*  So, for instance, when the Japanese come and they have come from what I hear, we will point [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=387.72s)]
*  out that they have one point two trillion dollars in savings and we want them to sell [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=392.92s)]
*  half of that because we want to divide the dollar. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=396.72s)]
*  But we don't want them to buy Chinese one or European euros or any other currency for [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=400.24s)]
*  that matter, because we don't want any other currency to compete with the US dollar. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=404.92s)]
*  So we are going to ask them to buy things we will point at or to, like, for instance, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=410.32s)]
*  stable coins like Tether or 30 year long dated US treasuries, because that way we reduce [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=415.12s)]
*  the long term interest rates of the United States while dividing the dollar and increasing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=426.44s)]
*  the competitiveness. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  So this is the kind of thinking that goes on in there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  They also bank on and not irrationally. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=435.56s)]
*  They are banking on the fact that from some countries like Germany, this has already happened. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  Already German car manufacturers and chemical industries like BASF, B-A-E-S-F, they are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=445.72s)]
*  shifting their capital investments from Germany to Texas, to New Mexico, to Arizona, to various [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  places in the United States. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  So that's the plan that they have. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=463.0s)]
*  But that's a legitimate goal, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=465.2s)]
*  That would be, I mean, leaving aside the other problems, I mean, from the perspective of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  an American president, promulgating to bring back jobs and companies and industry to the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  United States, that would be a desirable outcome or a legitimate objective. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=475.0s)]
*  It's a legitimate objective. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=480.52s)]
*  I don't think they will succeed in making it a reality. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=482.96s)]
*  And let me tell you, I could spend hours talking about this. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=487.55999999999995s)]
*  I won't though. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=491.28s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=492.28s)]
*  I knew. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=493.28s)]
*  I know you're an economist and you have a lot to say on tarot. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=498.84s)]
*  Yeah, I want to hear. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=499.84s)]
*  There are two points that I think are useful and quite succinct. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=500.84s)]
*  The first is this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  When Apple shifted some of its production lines from China to Austin, Texas to produce [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=505.96s)]
*  the MacBook Pro, the Apple MacBook Pro, they did bring manufacturing back to the United [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=513.68s)]
*  States, but very few jobs followed simply because of automation. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=521.04s)]
*  So even when Mercedes-Benz or Basp or some, you know, Alstom, a major manufacturer from [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=527.24s)]
*  Europe, shifts to the United States, automation is going to make sure, to ensure that the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  number of jobs that come to the United States is going to be much smaller, proportionally [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=542.04s)]
*  speaking, to the amount of capital that shifts to the United States. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=547.04s)]
*  That's one reason. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=550.68s)]
*  The second reason, Glenn, is this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=551.68s)]
*  Suppose it works. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  It begins to work. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=556.2399999999999s)]
*  It will work if it works. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=557.8s)]
*  It will work gradually. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  And as it works, in the hypothetical scenario that it works, the trade deficit of the United [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=562.8s)]
*  States shrinks, which is the object. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=569.4s)]
*  What happens then? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=573.28s)]
*  Well, as the trade deficit of the United States shrinks, the Germans, the Japanese and the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=574.28s)]
*  Chinese and the Saudi Arabians and so on, are going to have fewer dollars because their [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=580.0s)]
*  dollars come from the trade deficit of the United States. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=585.36s)]
*  OK, so they will be sending fewer dollars to Wall Street to bolster share prices, to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=588.52s)]
*  bolster bond prices and to bolster asset prices in Miami, in California, in Manhattan, in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=595.16s)]
*  real estate. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=603.8s)]
*  So that's my point. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=605.08s)]
*  And this is how I conclude. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=606.6s)]
*  I don't think that his types will work in the sense of shrinking substantially the American [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=609.16s)]
*  trade deficit. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  But even if it does, then Donald Trump is going to have some very irate, very angry [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  financial friends and realtor friends. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=623.44s)]
*  Which he does already. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=626.6s)]
*  But isn't that in some way a commendation of the plan? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=627.6s)]
*  In other words, the people who have been sucking the lifeblood out of the vibrancy of American [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=632.0s)]
*  economic life in the West, in the United States, these are the people most alarmed by and objecting [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=639.0400000000001s)]
*  to his plan. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=645.32s)]
*  And you saw that in the reaction to the stock market, but many other ways, precisely because [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=646.32s)]
*  it endangers that system that has been fattening them at the expense of everybody else. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=650.0400000000001s)]
*  Not exactly. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=656.1600000000001s)]
*  I wish it were. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  But what I think is this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=658.48s)]
*  Look, we must differentiate between the very short term and the long term. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=659.96s)]
*  What happened recently was this spasm in the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=664.68s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=669.08s)]
*  It's already gone. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=670.08s)]
*  You can see that the financial markets have recovered. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=671.08s)]
*  What Trump is telling them is, look, this is a very short campaign for long term gain. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=673.92s)]
*  This is what he's telling them. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=680.64s)]
*  Because soon I'm going to fire my second weapon. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=682.56s)]
*  The first one was the tariffs. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=686.0s)]
*  The second one will be massive tax cuts for the fat cats. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=687.08s)]
*  And you will benefit enormously. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=691.24s)]
*  You see the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=692.56s)]
*  NASDAQ is going to shoot through the roof. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=695.04s)]
*  OK? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=698.28s)]
*  That's what he's telling them. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=699.28s)]
*  So he's presenting the pain that they suffered in the last few weeks as a form of investment [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=701.1199999999999s)]
*  into even more wealth for them in the next two, three, five, ten, twenty years. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  What I am saying is that if his strategy works very soon after it starts working, then the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  rent extraction capacity of his mates is going to be damaged permanently. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  And that will put him in a political bind. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=727.44s)]
*  He will have to choose between going back, just peddling back and reversing course because [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=730.96s)]
*  he cannot stand. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=738.48s)]
*  I do not believe that he can politically or even psychologically stand the long term wrath [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=740.2s)]
*  of the bankers and of the realtors. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=745.84s)]
*  He's not FDR. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=747.96s)]
*  FDR stood in 1936 in Madison Square Garden and said that I treasure the hatred of the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=749.12s)]
*  bankers to my personal or some words to that effect. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=755.2800000000001s)]
*  Trump is not going to be that kind of president. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=758.36s)]
*  I hope he would be. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  But I think that there is a zero probability of him being that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=762.44s)]
*  So I don't think that that that that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=766.88s)]
*  But anyway, look, I don't think it's going to work anyway, because in the end, China [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  is not going to succumb to his bullying. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=774.4000000000001s)]
*  China is going to expand its realm within the BRICS plus countries. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=777.4s)]
*  There's going to be a new payment system that will increasingly be anchored on the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=784.4799999999999s)]
*  Chinese one. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=791.5999999999999s)]
*  Trump may have quite a bit of success in the next two or three years in extracting [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=794.12s)]
*  concessions. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=801.5999999999999s)]
*  You saw this yesterday when Keir Starmer ridiculed himself by celebrating a so-called [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=803.0s)]
*  comprehensive US-UK trade deal, which is nothing. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=809.68s)]
*  There's nothing comprehensive about it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=815.28s)]
*  And it is a great success for Donald, but not a great success for Keir Starmer. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=816.92s)]
*  So Trump can score quite enough victories in the next two or three years. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=821.96s)]
*  But I don't think it's going to be to go down in history to be remembered by historians [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=828.0s)]
*  in the future in the same way that Nixon was, because Nixon's shock in 1971, which was [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=833.64s)]
*  very similar to the Trump shock, had continued. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=838.24s)]
*  It continued after him. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=841.96s)]
*  It was continued by Carter. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=843.52s)]
*  It was continued by Reagan. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=845.84s)]
*  Will this policy of shrinking the rent extraction powers of the powers that be of the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=848.04s)]
*  interior class in the United States have any follow up? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=855.24s)]
*  I find this very hard to believe, independently of whether we have a Republican or a [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=859.5200000000001s)]
*  Democratic White House. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, what I've thought for a long time is that no matter how powerful a president [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=867.6400000000001s)]
*  is, no matter how much of a popular mandate they have or whatever, how much they have [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=871.72s)]
*  a party control of both congresses, the only things they can't really withstand are [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=875.32s)]
*  serious upset and anger by the banking class, by Wall Street, by the financiers. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=879.84s)]
*  There's, I think, a president, no matter how popular would be destroyed, trying to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=885.5200000000001s)]
*  destroy the power of the modern presidency in terms of how it's constructed. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=891.12s)]
*  And maybe you can imagine like a very passionate, devoted, charismatic, shrewd leader [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=897.72s)]
*  like FDR reappearing who could. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  But the way American power functions, I think, would be very, very difficult to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=903.84s)]
*  impossible. And then the other way would be, you know, trying to destroy the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=907.8000000000001s)]
*  intelligence community or the military industrial class. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=912.4399999999999s)]
*  And then finally, I think the last way, maybe the hardest thing to do would be to [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=914.92s)]
*  separate the United States from Israel and sort of put an end to the largesse that [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=919.1999999999999s)]
*  the United States has long given to Israel. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBIG1lijHrQ&t=922.92s)]
