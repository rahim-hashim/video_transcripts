# NEW: Assange Wins Very Partial Victory in UK Court, w/ Stella Assange
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4)
*  In 2019, Ecuador, upon immense pressure applied by the United States, by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=0.0s)]
*  British government, and by the government of Spain, lifted the grant of asylum that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=12.84s)]
*  they had given to Julian Assange back in 2012, which they gave him as protection [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=18.76s)]
*  against what they knew, the Ecuadorian government knew, would be the persecution [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=25.52s)]
*  of Assange by the United States government, the attempt by the United [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=30.4s)]
*  States government to get Assange to bring him to the United States and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=33.0s)]
*  imprison him for life for the journalism that he had been doing. That was [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=36.72s)]
*  not just the right of the Ecuadorian government, but under human rights [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=42.96s)]
*  conventions, its duty to protect Assange from that kind of persecution through [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  the grant of asylum. But a combination of Mike Pompeo, who at the time was Trump's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=51.0s)]
*  CIA director, and obsessed with destroying Julian Assange in Wookiee [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=55.92s)]
*  Lakes, combined with the British government and the government of Spain, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=59.16s)]
*  angry at Assange for his journalism, bullied the Ecuadorians, coerced them, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=61.92s)]
*  cajoled them into lifting their asylum, and the minute they did in 2019, the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=65.6s)]
*  London police went in and arrested Julian Assange. He was already seven years [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=70.6s)]
*  inside this little tiny embassy in the middle of London, someplace where I had [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=75.68s)]
*  visited him and I had seen him. There was no light in there. He was already [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=79.6s)]
*  suffering physically and mentally from this asylum. Knowing that he had to stay [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=82.32s)]
*  there, the minute he left, he would be picked up by the British police, which he [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=86.28s)]
*  was when he finally had his asylum lifted. And he's ever since, now in his fifth [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=89.32s)]
*  full year, been in a high security prison called Belmarsh, which the BBC calls [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  Guantanamo, the British Guantanamo. It's the place where terrorism suspects go, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=100.72s)]
*  people who have committed the worst crimes, and Assange's doctors have said [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=106.08s)]
*  that he is rapidly declining both physically and mentally. And the amazing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=110.84s)]
*  thing about the fact that Julian Assange has now been in prison for almost five [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=114.96s)]
*  years is that the only thing he was convicted of was a misdemeanor crime of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=118.52s)]
*  bail jumping, which is how the British government understood his application [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=125.16s)]
*  for asylum, that he didn't show up for his bail hearing. Instead, he got asylum [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=130.44s)]
*  from the Ecuadorian government when they arrested him. They charged him and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=133.6s)]
*  convicted him with bail jumping, which was a misdemeanor they gave him the full [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=136.72s)]
*  prison term, which was 11 months in prison. He long ago served those 11 months. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=140.36s)]
*  And right as he was about to get out after that 11-month term, that was when [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=145.48s)]
*  the US government unveiled this indictment in 2018 and then immediately [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=150.12s)]
*  sought his extradition. And ever since, he's been contesting this extradition, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=155.0s)]
*  and it's been making its way through the British court system. And this entire [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=158.76s)]
*  time, the British courts have kept him in a prison, in a high-security prison, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=162.92s)]
*  just pending a resolution in the courts of his extradition. Now, obviously, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=167.64s)]
*  there are all kinds of measures they could have taken, including ankle [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=172.64s)]
*  monitoring and all sorts of things that are done to some of the people charged [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  with the worst crimes who haven't yet been convicted, but they refused to give [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=179.76s)]
*  any of those measures to Julian Assange while leading his extradition hearing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  They instead insisted on keeping him in a high-security prison. Back in 2021, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=187.8s)]
*  the very first British court, this is more than three years ago now, in January [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=194.12s)]
*  2021, heard Julian Assange's arguments about why extradition to the United [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  States would be illegal under both British law and European law, including [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=203.8s)]
*  the fact that it was a crime punishing him for his journalism, that it violated [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=208.36s)]
*  the free speech and free press guarantees of the European Human Rights Convention, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=212.84s)]
*  to which the UK is bound, that it's a political crime of the kind for which the UK cannot [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=218.36s)]
*  extradite defendants. A whole array of arguments, including that it was designed [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=223.72s)]
*  to be political persecution, and the British court rejected every one of those arguments in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=229.56s)]
*  the first instance, but nonetheless rejected the American extradition request on one ground, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=233.24s)]
*  namely that Assange's health had deteriorated to such an extent, and that the conditions under [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=239.48s)]
*  which he would be kept in the United States in a high-security prison are so repressive and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  burdensome and abusive that he'd be very unlikely to survive the extradition and the imprisonment [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=252.92s)]
*  in the United States, and for that reason rejected the American extradition request. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=260.36s)]
*  The US government appealed that and then has been winning ever since. The courts have been [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=264.68s)]
*  repeatedly rejecting Assange's request, have been accepting the arguments for extradition, and today [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=269.24s)]
*  the highest court possible, the UK High Court, the highest court that Assange could appeal to, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=277.0s)]
*  issued a ruling after hearing his appeal, an oral argument several months ago, and they issued what [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=282.04s)]
*  in effect is a partial victory for Julian Assange. Had the court ruling today rejected Assange's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=289.0s)]
*  arguments and ruled in favor of the government, it likely would have meant that Assange would have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=296.6s)]
*  been on the plane to the United States within hours upon issuance of this ruling. He still had a right [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=300.36s)]
*  to appeal to a European court and claim that the UK was violating European conventions, but it's very [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=305.88s)]
*  possible the British government might have acted as quickly as possible to send him on a plane [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=312.6s)]
*  to the United States to prevent that appeal from being heard. Instead, the British High Court [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=317.16s)]
*  said that three different grounds that Julian Assange presented as to why the US extradition request [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=321.72s)]
*  is very plausibly illegal were actually valid, and as a result of the possible validity of these [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=329.24s)]
*  problems with the US extradition request, these legal problems, the court said we're not going [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  to order him extradited. We're going to give the US government until April 16th to submit [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=341.8s)]
*  documentation to see if they can address our concerns, and then if they can, we'll rule in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=348.6s)]
*  May, and if they can't, we very well might then end up just rejecting the extradition request. Now [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=354.04s)]
*  there are certain parts of this ruling that decided in favor of Assange, or at least said [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=361.72s)]
*  there's problems with the extradition request, that the Biden administration might very easily [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  be able to fix, but there's other parts of it that they very well might not be able to fix to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=372.76s)]
*  the satisfaction of the British court, and this could really throw a huge wrench into the attempt [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  by the US government to bring Assange to the United States to stand trial on espionage charges where [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=383.32s)]
*  he would almost certainly be found guilty. The Espionage Act is a very strict law where you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=388.68s)]
*  can't even raise First Amendment defenses such as you were justified in doing what you did. It's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=395.24s)]
*  almost written, it was written in 1917 to criminalize dissent under Woodrow Wilson's policy [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=402.12s)]
*  of involving the US in World War I, and people actually went to prison under the Espionage Act [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  in 1917 for opposing the US involvement in World War I. They made it a crime, an espionage act, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  to oppose US national security. That's the law that Donald Trump is currently being prosecuted [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=420.04s)]
*  under, that Edward Snowden is being prosecuted under, that Daniel Ellsberg was prosecuted under, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  and that all kinds of whistleblowers have been prosecuted under and that they're using now against [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=430.03999999999996s)]
*  Assange. Now here is the high court ruling today. There you see the UK High Court of Justice, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  and there you see the caption of the case. It's Julian Paul Assange versus the United States [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=441.32s)]
*  government, the government of the United States, and the Secretary of State for the Home Department. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=448.28s)]
*  And as I said, there were I think 13 or 14 total grounds raised by Assange as to why the extradition [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=455.0s)]
*  request should be rejected. The court went through them one after the next just like every other [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=463.56s)]
*  part of the British court system has done and just rejected them, saying this isn't a political [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=468.44s)]
*  crime, it doesn't violate your free press rights, it's not punishment without law. All sorts of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=473.79999999999995s)]
*  valid arguments that the British courts have just been completely unwilling to accept. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=481.64s)]
*  But there were three grounds that the court said might actually have validity. The first of which [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  was this. This is ground five, whether the applicant might be prejudiced at his trial by [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=491.16s)]
*  reason of his nationality. And this is part of what the court said, quote, on this issue we consider [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=498.52s)]
*  that the applicant has identified a properly arguable ground of appeal. The applicant wishes [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  to argue at any trial in the United States that his actions were protected by the First Amendment. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=511.56s)]
*  He contends that if he is given First Amendment rights, the prosecution will be stopped. The First [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=517.4s)]
*  Amendment is therefore of central importance to his defense, to the extradition charge. It follows [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=522.04s)]
*  that it is arguable that the applicant might be treated differently at trial on the grounds of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  his nationality. Subject to the question of whether this could be addressed by means of an [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=533.08s)]
*  assurance from the respondent, we would grant leave to appeal on ground five. Now this is the one that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=538.12s)]
*  I think really complicates things for the United States. All along Julian Assange has been arguing [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=542.84s)]
*  that his prosecution as a journalist in the United States is barred under the First Amendment. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  And one of the arguments the U.S. government has made, and they might have really shot themselves [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=556.2s)]
*  in the foot with this, is that they have argued that Julian Assange has no right to invoke his [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=560.12s)]
*  First Amendment rights because he's not an American citizen and he's not on American soil, nor was he [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=566.76s)]
*  at the time of the crime, and therefore the First Amendment doesn't apply to people like Julian [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=572.6s)]
*  Assange. It only applies to American citizens. As it turns out, under British extradition law, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=577.8s)]
*  if a person whose extradition is sought might be prejudiced at his trial by reason of his nationality, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  that is a grounds for refusing to send him to that country. In other words, if that country is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=598.0400000000001s)]
*  going to treat him differently because of his nationality, then that is a reason why the British [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=602.44s)]
*  Court is barred from extraditing him to the United States. And so the argument is that the U.S. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=609.0s)]
*  government itself has said the First Amendment is only for Americans. It doesn't apply to people [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=614.36s)]
*  like Julian Assange. And in fact, when Mike Pompeo in 2017 as Trump's CIA director gave a speech, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=620.52s)]
*  which at the time I reported on and described as incredibly disturbing and creepy, he stood up and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=626.84s)]
*  he vowed to destroy WikiLeaks and he said they keep acting as though the First Amendment applies [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=631.72s)]
*  to them and it does not. Assange's lawyers have cited those statements of Mike Pompeo and others [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=636.84s)]
*  inside the U.S. government saying Julian Assange has no First Amendment rights. That's for Americans [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=642.28s)]
*  only. And so the Court is saying this seems like a good argument that Assange will be treated [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=646.76s)]
*  differently by virtue of his nationality if he goes to the United States and tries to argue the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=653.72s)]
*  First Amendment as a reason why you can't prosecute a journalist, the government might say [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=658.4399999999999s)]
*  this is for Americans only, not for Australians. And therefore that's discrimination based on [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=664.28s)]
*  nationality and it would prevent the U.K. government from ex-joining him there. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=668.28s)]
*  Now what they've essentially given the United States government the chance to do by April 16th [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=674.76s)]
*  is try and give assurances to the Court that no, don't worry, Assange won't be treated differently [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=678.84s)]
*  by virtue of his nationality. He will be able to invoke the same First Amendment rights as Americans. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=684.84s)]
*  The problem is that they have been arguing the opposite for many years. And the bigger problem, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=690.12s)]
*  I think, is that ultimately whether Assange has the right to invoke the First Amendment, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=696.28s)]
*  and in general it is well established the First Amendment that the Constitution of the United [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=701.8s)]
*  States is not only for American citizens, it's for anybody who is within the grasp of the American [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=705.88s)]
*  government. For example, in 2004 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantanamo have the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=711.56s)]
*  right of habeas corpus, the right to ask the Court to release them on the grounds that they're being [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  unlawfully detained. And of course the detainees at Guantanamo are not American citizens, they [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=724.04s)]
*  weren't American citizens, but the Court found that Guantanamo was American territory. And because [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=728.52s)]
*  it was American territory, the Constitution applies to everything the government does to anybody. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=735.88s)]
*  The problem for the U.S. government here is that the alleged crimes that Assange is said to have [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=741.48s)]
*  committed were committed not only when he wasn't an American citizen, but also not on American soil. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's very difficult to understand how the government will be able to give assurances to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=752.84s)]
*  the British Court that an American court for whom the U.S. government does not speak will allow [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=756.52s)]
*  Assange to invoke the same First Amendment right as any American would. Now the Biden Justice [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=763.1600000000001s)]
*  Department really wants to get their hands on Assange. They have very smart lawyers working [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=769.88s)]
*  with the Justice Department, they have an unlimited budget. My guess is they'll come up with some theory [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=774.84s)]
*  that will convince the British Court, oh don't worry we're going to treat him the same as we [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=779.16s)]
*  treat Americans, he'll be able to invoke all the same First Amendment rights. But at the very least [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=783.3199999999999s)]
*  it does create certain difficulties here because of the fact that the U.S. government has to not [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=788.4399999999999s)]
*  only contradict everything it's been saying about Assange's First Amendment rights, but also somehow [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=794.52s)]
*  has to offer an assurance that Assange will be given certain rights that it's not the government [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=799.48s)]
*  to give, but it's the courts to give. So we'll see whether or not this really complicates [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=804.52s)]
*  the extradition in a meaningful way. Now here's the second ground the court cited as to why [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=808.6s)]
*  Assange couldn't be extradited, at least today, until the government gives more assurances. And [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=815.72s)]
*  that is ground number six. The extradition is barred if there is insufficient protection from [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=820.52s)]
*  the death penalty. And here's what the court said about that. This is a prohibition in British law [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=827.48s)]
*  on extraditing anybody to a country where they might face the death penalty. European countries [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=835.0s)]
*  are against the death penalty, they don't extradite people if they might be put to death for the crimes [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=841.24s)]
*  with which they're charged. And the U.S. government has already said that the crimes with which Julian [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=846.36s)]
*  Assange is currently charged are not punishable by death. And Assange's argument is, well the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=851.96s)]
*  crimes that I'm charged with now might not be punishable by death, but once I get there [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=857.72s)]
*  they have the ability to charge me with more crimes including some that might be punishable [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=861.88s)]
*  by death. And he cited the fact that there's reporting that the U.S. government already tried [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=866.4399999999999s)]
*  to kill him through assassination, explored that possibility. And even though the court [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=870.6s)]
*  refused to accept that evidence, clearly there is a possibility that the U.S. government would want [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=875.24s)]
*  to give Julian Assange the death penalty. And about that the court said the following, quote, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=880.2s)]
*  The applicant accepts that none of the offenses for which extradition is sought carry the death [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=884.76s)]
*  penalty. He contends, however, that the facts which are alleged against him could lead to a [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=889.0s)]
*  charge of aiding and abetting treason under 18 USC paragraph 2381 or espionage under 18 USC 794, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=896.44s)]
*  both of which are capital offenses. Accordingly, subject to the provisions of appropriate [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=905.08s)]
*  assurances, we would grant leave to appeal on this ground. Now my guess is all the U.S. government [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=909.72s)]
*  has to do is write a letter to the British court saying, oh, not only is he not charged now [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=916.2s)]
*  with crimes for which the death penalty is eligible, we promise that even if he's ultimately [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=921.88s)]
*  charged with treason or abetting treason or other capital offenses, we won't seek the death penalty. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=927.0s)]
*  Now that may not be enough because the court could still give it, but they could also promise just [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=935.08s)]
*  not to charge him with any crimes for which the death penalty is a possibility and the court [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=940.36s)]
*  would probably say, okay, well, we accept your assurances there. Now I know you're probably [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=947.16s)]
*  thinking assurance to the United States government are worthless. They could just get Assange there [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=951.4s)]
*  and violate them all. And of course, that's true. That would have implications if you just lie to [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=955.72s)]
*  the British court because the U.S. government the next time they want to extradite somebody from the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=961.0s)]
*  UK would not have a lot of credibility. But it's certainly possible. And if I were joining Assange, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=964.76s)]
*  that would not give me a lot of comfort and assurance from the justice department. Oh, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=969.8s)]
*  we promise not to do that. Now here's the third ground that the court recognizes sufficiently [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=973.56s)]
*  valid to at least for now up withhold the extradition. The extradition is incompatible [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=981.0s)]
*  with article 10 of the convention, the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=989.0799999999999s)]
*  freedom of expression. Now Assange's argument was that the free speech and free press rights [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=994.84s)]
*  bar prosecution and the court rejected that. But this argument says that because he's not [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  an American citizen, he may be barred from raising the same free speech rights as are guaranteed in [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1010.6s)]
*  the EU convention. And if he gets sent to the United States and the United States doesn't give [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1018.44s)]
*  him the same right of free speech as the EU EU convention, the extradition should not be granted. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1023.96s)]
*  You can't send a citizen subject to the European Convention of Human Rights to a country where the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1030.1200000000001s)]
*  free speech protections are less. And so this is what the court said, quote, free speech is a [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1036.04s)]
*  fundamental right recognized by the common law and by international and domestic human rights [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1041.72s)]
*  instruments. We adjourn the renewed application for leave to appeal on grounds four, five, and nine. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1046.9199999999998s)]
*  The adjournment is for a period of 55 days until May 20 of 2024, subject to the following directions. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1053.24s)]
*  The U.S. government has permission to file any assurances with the court by April 16, 2024. In [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  other words, on all three of those grounds that Assange may not have the same rights as an American [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1065.9599999999998s)]
*  citizen under the first amendment, that he may not be able to have the same free speech rights [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1071.9599999999998s)]
*  that's guaranteed by the EU constitution or the EU convention, and that he still might be subject [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1075.32s)]
*  to the death penalty through future charges if the court does not give the or if the U.S. government [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1081.0s)]
*  does not give the EU the UK court adequate assurances by April 16th to assuage those concerns, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  it seems like the court is saying they will strongly consider rejecting the extradition request. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1095.1599999999999s)]
*  Now to me, and I think you can say this seems like lawyer games, the Justice Department will [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1103.16s)]
*  be able to write a letter sufficient to address the court's concerns so they can rubber stamp the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1107.8s)]
*  extradition, but I've always questioned whether the Biden administration at the end of the day [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1112.52s)]
*  really wants to bring Julian Assange to prison to stand trial on American soil. Imagine the [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1117.6399999999999s)]
*  sideshow that would create, the protest outside the courtroom, the discovery Assange's lawyers [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1123.56s)]
*  would have in the classified information, the right of Julian Assange to take the stand [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1129.56s)]
*  and testify, the fact that Joe Biden would be the first ever American president to preside over the [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  imprisonment of somebody for publishing classified information reporting on the government. I think [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1139.32s)]
*  they're happy with the status quo when he's just in prison, dying, being slowly destroyed [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1145.56s)]
*  with no charges, and what this really has done in some sense is delayed ultimate exoneration, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1150.9199999999998s)]
*  but if you're Julian Assange and if you're his family, the last thing you want, and I think this [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1157.64s)]
*  is so notable, is extradition to the United States government. Look at how hard they fought to prevent [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1161.5600000000002s)]
*  that because nobody trusts imprisonment in the United States government. We sat down with Stella [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1166.76s)]
*  Assange, which is Julian Assange's wife, and she on her in her own right is a human rights lawyer. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1173.0s)]
*  He met Stella Assange when he was already in the Ecuadorian embassy. They have two children [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1179.4s)]
*  together and she has been steadfastly fighting for his freedom. She is, I think, his best [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1184.44s)]
*  spokesperson, his best asset, and we sat down with her just a few minutes ago and we talked to her [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1190.44s)]
*  about today's ruling and the impact on her family as well as free speech rights. Here's that interview. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1194.68s)]
*  Stella, good evening. It's great to see you. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. I [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1202.52s)]
*  know it's a busy day. Thanks for having me. Absolutely. So I think it's fair to describe [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1205.6399999999999s)]
*  the court ruling today as a partial victory. It upheld some of the arguments advanced by [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1213.08s)]
*  Julian's lawyers and rejected others. At the same time, it didn't reject the US extradition. In some [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1221.0s)]
*  sense, it might have just delayed it. How do you see the overall impact of this ruling, and do you [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1225.8s)]
*  consider it a victory? It's a very strange ruling. I mean, we found out about it just as the rest of [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1231.9599999999998s)]
*  the world found out about it at 10.30 London time. What it is basically is that the court identified [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1241.16s)]
*  three issues that Julian should be granted leave for appeal in relation to and then gave the United [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1250.76s)]
*  States a second bite of the apple to modify its arguments before the full appeal. So, you know, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1258.76s)]
*  they had plenty of opportunity to address these issues during the two-day hearing. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1269.56s)]
*  Basically, the court is giving the US another chance to shift things to have a better chance [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1276.6799999999998s)]
*  at winning in a full appeal argument. So it's bizarre. It's also [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1284.44s)]
*  very bizarre that the UK courts have ignored some of the really basic arguments that we presented. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1290.44s)]
*  But as I said, no one could anticipate this decision, and it's another bizarre turn in [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1303.88s)]
*  this political case. So I have to say, when I first read it this morning, my immediate reaction [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1311.0800000000002s)]
*  was that the court in the United States, a period of time to basically, in a sense, adjust or fix [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1316.76s)]
*  its extradition request to cure some of the defects that the court had identified as existing within [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1324.04s)]
*  it, such as not giving enough of a guarantee, for example, that Julian won't eventually face [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1332.28s)]
*  the death penalty. My original thought was, oh, it's going to be very easy for the Justice Department [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1336.76s)]
*  to just give these kind of verbal assurances or semantic assurances, and then the court will say, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1341.08s)]
*  now we have what we need to extradite him. The more I think about it though, it's probably true [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1346.4399999999998s)]
*  for that example that I gave, that will be easy. But for some of these other demands that the court [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1351.56s)]
*  made of the United States, including a guarantee that Julian will be able to raise the same First [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1356.4399999999998s)]
*  Amendment rights that would be available to American citizens, as well as in the European [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1360.4399999999998s)]
*  court, my sense is it might be very difficult for the Justice Department to offer the court that, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1367.0s)]
*  because ultimately that's really a decision for the court to make, not for the US government to [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1372.12s)]
*  make. I'm wondering, in this very short period of time that you've had talking to Julian's lawyers [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1377.7199999999998s)]
*  and thinking about it yourself, whether you think the US government might have difficulty meeting [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1382.9199999999998s)]
*  some of these conditions that the court set for it as a condition for extraditing Julian? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1387.9599999999998s)]
*  I do think that it poses major difficulties. So just to look back at what the court has identified [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1392.68s)]
*  as the sticking points here, the first is that he's exposed to the charges shifting once he's on US [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1406.68s)]
*  soil, that he could be exposed to the death penalty, the same facts. Secondly though, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1419.96s)]
*  the US has argued in its sworn affidavits that the government could argue that Julian does not enjoy [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1429.64s)]
*  constitutional protections because he is not a US citizen and because he was not on US soil, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1439.96s)]
*  basically acknowledging that they intend to bring an argument that because he's not a US citizen, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1445.88s)]
*  he doesn't have constitutional rights. Now this is a point that the UK courts have said, well, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1455.16s)]
*  give us an assurance that he won't be discriminated against on the basis of his nationality. So they're [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1459.96s)]
*  asking the US government to issue assurances contradicting the prosecutor's statement that was [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1466.92s)]
*  given under oath. So it's shifting the case basically. And then the First Amendment, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1473.8s)]
*  the ability to invoke the First Amendment. And of course, the Espionage Act has no public interest [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1480.68s)]
*  defense and this is simply just uncharted ground. So it's a very strange place for the US government [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1486.28s)]
*  now to be in, I think. But that's not to say that US government doesn't have a whole [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1496.36s)]
*  big team of lawyers that will craft some so-called assurances that the British courts [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1507.56s)]
*  might accept. This is political. It's basically trying to find a political fix for a legal problem. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1514.9199999999998s)]
*  And the British courts are, it seems, bending over backwards to find a way to make it easier. And I [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1520.9199999999998s)]
*  read this decision as a way to pass the buck to the US government to say, well, eventually if they [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1528.6799999999998s)]
*  do extradite him, if something happens to Julian, then they can blame the US. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WK8qkK_oN4&t=1534.9199999999998s)]
