# Former Trump Official Fred Fleitz on Trump's Ukraine Policy, Venezuela, John Bolton, and More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA)
*  Okay, so I'm pleased to be joined by Fred Fleitz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=0.0s)]
*  He was a Trump administration official and then he worked for the National Security Council [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=10.18s)]
*  in 2018. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=15.96s)]
*  He also worked for the State Department under George W. Bush. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=16.96s)]
*  And now he's a vice chair at the America First Policy Institute. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=21.68s)]
*  So we want to talk to him about various aspects of the first Trump administration's record [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=27.12s)]
*  and what that might foretell about a second Trump administration. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=31.46s)]
*  So Fred Fleitz, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=37.8s)]
*  So I wanted to go through the Trump administration's policy on Venezuela, if you don't mind, in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=39.92s)]
*  light of the election yesterday. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=46.08s)]
*  The Trump administration, including this was spearheaded by John Bolton, who you were the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=48.68s)]
*  chief of staff to for some time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=53.16s)]
*  Their idea was to inflict maximum economic pain on Venezuela with the idea that this [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=56.56s)]
*  would destabilize the government and empower the Venezuelan opposition. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=62.2s)]
*  And eventually you could have instituted in Venezuela a more America-friendly government [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=67.76s)]
*  and oust the socialists or the leftist rulers under Maduro and Chavez, which had been in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=72.76s)]
*  power for quite a while at that point in Venezuela. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=80.84s)]
*  But it seems to me, especially with Maduro yesterday having declared victory in the election, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=84.5s)]
*  and we could call into doubt whether the results are legitimate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=89.58s)]
*  I'm not there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=93.54s)]
*  You're not there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=94.54s)]
*  So I haven't been observing the polling stations to see whether everything is above board electorally [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=95.54s)]
*  in terms of vote administration in Venezuela. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=100.98s)]
*  But regardless, the central committee that runs election administration in Venezuela [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=104.66s)]
*  declared Maduro to be the winner. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=109.16s)]
*  And so now, at least if the current trajectory holds, he's going to be in power for another [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=112.26s)]
*  six or something years, at least. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=116.18s)]
*  And it would seem that this strategy on the part of the Trump administration to batter [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=119.18s)]
*  Venezuela with maximum sanctions and attempt to impose regime change, and much of these [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  same policies were then replicated or continued by the Biden administration, which reimposed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  many of the Trump-era sanctions of Venezuela. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=136.18s)]
*  It seems like it's been a manifest failure to me, even by its own terms or by its own [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=138.66s)]
*  stated criteria for what the goal would be of the policy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=144.18s)]
*  What am I missing? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  What am I missing? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's great to be here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  I just want to add that I spent most of my career with the CIA as an analyst, and I broke [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=151.78s)]
*  with John Bolton, resigned from his staff, and denounced him when he wrote his tell-all [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=157.18s)]
*  book against President Trump, just to set the record straight. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=161.42s)]
*  Look, we had this corrupt election in Venezuela. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=165.42s)]
*  We've been seeing this since 2000. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with the United States government trying to push Venezuela in the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=170.26s)]
*  right direction. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=173.98s)]
*  But I think under an America first approach to U.S. national security, we really have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=174.98s)]
*  to think about what is really in our strategic interest. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=180.22s)]
*  And I think putting pressure on Venezuela to move in the right direction is fine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=182.94s)]
*  But look, when Bolton was in office, he was implying to the Venezuelans, we might use [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=187.5s)]
*  military force against the country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=192.54s)]
*  And I think there's something similar being thought of by the Democrats, that there should [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=194.82s)]
*  be some type of U.S. intervention in the country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm not for that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  Some pressure is fine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=203.26s)]
*  But I also think we have to realize we're not the world's policeman. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=204.54s)]
*  We can't solve every problem. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=207.28s)]
*  And this one, frankly, I think, for the foreseeable future, is not something the U.S. can solve. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm glad you gave that clarification of you breaking from Bolton when Bolton was authoring [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=215.42s)]
*  his book, because I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the Trump de Auge attempt [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=220.98s)]
*  to block publication of that book on the grounds that Bolton was revealing unapproved classified [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=227.82s)]
*  information or sensitive information? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=235.42s)]
*  But just to clarify for my own knowledge, have you broken with Bolton on any substantive [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=238.98s)]
*  Or did you just object to him taking on an adversarial posture with respect to Trump [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=245.86s)]
*  after he left his post at the national security, as national security advisor, because at that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=252.78s)]
*  time you were Bolton's chief of staff, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=258.54s)]
*  So in the years that have transpired since, have you discovered any policy differences [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=261.02000000000004s)]
*  Or was it just kind of more personal in relation to his stance toward Trump just as a persona? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=269.5s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you asked. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=276.5s)]
*  In mid-2019, I was on Tucker Carlton's show, good friend and Glenn Greenwald's, and I think [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=279.42s)]
*  Tucker had me on because the next day in June of 2019, the U.S. was scheduled to bomb Iran [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=285.1s)]
*  after it shot down a drone. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=291.98s)]
*  You may remember that almost all of Trump's national security staff, except for my colleague [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  Keith Kellogg, thought this was a great idea. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=299.22s)]
*  But at the last minute, Trump said it would be disproportionate to kill a couple hundred [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=302.26000000000005s)]
*  Iranians because they just shut down a drone. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  Now, Tucker had me on thinking he was going to beat me up because I had been Bolton's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=309.06s)]
*  chief of staff and I probably supported bombing Iran. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=313.1s)]
*  I did not. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  I thought that was disproportionate. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=317.26s)]
*  And I want to keep our country out of unnecessary wars. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=318.66s)]
*  I make that point in a new book that's been put out by the America First Policy Institute [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=322.02s)]
*  that I edited, An America First Approach to U.S. National Security. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=326.82s)]
*  We need to have a strong military, a decisive president, use our military force decisively [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=330.34s)]
*  but prudently to keep ourselves out of unnecessary wars. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=336.17999999999995s)]
*  Look, John Bolton, I think he served his country well during most of his career, but he really [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=339.41999999999996s)]
*  does want to bomb Iran, and that's something I've never agreed with him on. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=344.34s)]
*  Okay, I want to pull up this excerpt of an article that you wrote for Newsmax in 2019. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=347.78s)]
*  You bemoan, and this was when the Venezuela policy was ramping up and the Trump administration [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=356.34s)]
*  to try to force some regime change, and you were lamenting that Venezuela could turn into [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=361.5s)]
*  a new Russian outpost in the Americas. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=367.02s)]
*  So my question for you is, in light of this election and of Putin congratulating Maduro [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  and pledging to foster even closer ties between Russia and Venezuela, do you view it as within [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=378.18s)]
*  the ambit of America First to try to block any encroachment by Russia or China in the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=386.70000000000005s)]
*  Western Hemisphere and basically reimpose some variation of the Monroe Doctrine, which [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=395.98s)]
*  is what was cited when the Trump administration was going forward with their attempt to impose [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=401.54s)]
*  regime change in Venezuela in 2019? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=406.82s)]
*  Is it America First in your mind to try to have basically American hegemony in the entire [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=410.1s)]
*  Western Hemisphere, or does America First mean just worry about our own territory within [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=417.54s)]
*  our own borders, and if other countries in Central or South America want to develop ties [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=423.3s)]
*  with other powers, then that's their own prerogative? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=428.7s)]
*  I'm not in isolation, neither is President Trump. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=434.06s)]
*  I am concerned at the relationship, the growing relationships that Venezuela has struck with [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=437.5s)]
*  Russia and China and Iran, and I think the U.S. has to use a variety of tools, short [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=443.14s)]
*  of military force, to stop that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=448.74s)]
*  That's not in our interest. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  We should be working with our allies to stop that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=452.18s)]
*  We should make it clear to Venezuela that it is not in its interest to make these deals. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=454.9s)]
*  I think that is an America First position. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=459.7s)]
*  I don't think that we should be getting ourselves in more armed conflicts. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=462.02s)]
*  We shouldn't be sending our troops abroad, our Navy abroad, for interests that do not [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=465.85999999999996s)]
*  affect our strategic interests, and this is something I think goes outside of that area, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  but that doesn't mean we shouldn't use other tools of statecraft to discourage these relationships. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so now I want to go to your policy paper that you authored, as you mentioned before, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=484.26s)]
*  with General Keith Kellogg in association with the America First Policy Institute, and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=490.7s)]
*  it was reported a few weeks ago that you submitted this policy proposal to Trump. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=495.58s)]
*  This is for Ukraine and coming to some sort of settlement in the Ukraine war. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=502.34s)]
*  So just to clarify off the top, you did submit a version of this America First Policy Institute, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=506.34s)]
*  which wants to do plan for Ukraine to Trump, and he received that plan. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=513.6999999999999s)]
*  Can you just describe what that interaction was like and what you surmised from it in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=517.38s)]
*  terms of whether Trump indicated receptiveness to the plan that you submitted to him for Ukraine? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=522.42s)]
*  Look, I don't work for President Trump or the campaign. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=528.42s)]
*  This is not a peace plan. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=532.5799999999999s)]
*  It's a research paper, and what it does, it talks about how Biden's policies encourage [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=534.38s)]
*  Putin to invade Ukraine. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  Biden's policies made the war worse, and Biden has been interested in discussing ways to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=542.1s)]
*  end the war. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=547.34s)]
*  Now, we have some ideas on how to end the war, but we say towards the end of the paper [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=548.34s)]
*  that Trump has his own plan to end the war, and he hasn't said what it is. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=552.7s)]
*  Like many experts, we send our papers to a variety of people, including to President Trump. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=557.62s)]
*  That's all I'm going to say about that, but this is not a peace plan. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=564.46s)]
*  It is not a Trump document. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=567.62s)]
*  Beyond that, I don't know what to say. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=569.62s)]
*  I don't work for President Trump, and this doesn't reflect his position or those of the campaign. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=572.38s)]
*  Oh, no. I'm not suggesting that it reflects his position. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=576.74s)]
*  I just wanted to see if you would confirm that you submitted this plan to Trump and that [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=578.78s)]
*  it was received. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=584.02s)]
*  Of course, we don't know what the ultimate policy approach that he takes is going to be. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=585.02s)]
*  It's a research paper. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=588.54s)]
*  It's a series of ideas. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=590.54s)]
*  It's not a peace plan. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=592.3s)]
*  Reuters erroneously called this a peace plan. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=593.58s)]
*  If you look at it, it's mostly a discussion of this terrible conflict and how we got into [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  it and how to keep our country out of similar conflicts. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=603.5s)]
*  This happens when you have a weak American president. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=607.26s)]
*  Biden's weakness caused Putin to invade. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  We go over that in great detail. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=612.98s)]
*  One thing we try to say is, beyond trying to solve this conflict, how do we stop future [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=615.74s)]
*  conflicts like this from starting that suck up tax dollars and our military weapons that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=621.5s)]
*  we need elsewhere? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=628.38s)]
*  So among the prescriptions or among the criticisms in the plan or in the research proposal, which [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=630.86s)]
*  I read, is that you say that President Biden should have provided Ukraine with the weapons [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=638.82s)]
*  it needed to expel Russian forces early in the war, which leads me to conclude that the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=644.0600000000001s)]
*  criticism of Biden is that he wasn't aggressive enough in provisioning arms to Ukraine, at [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=649.86s)]
*  least early on, which is different from, I guess, what you would think of as a more conventional [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=655.5400000000001s)]
*  notion of an America first approach to Ukraine. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=662.2600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, America first is a very fluid concept. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=665.0600000000001s)]
*  It can have different meanings to different people. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=667.5s)]
*  But sending more and more high grade weaponry systems to Ukraine than the Biden administration [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=669.62s)]
*  had, that might strike some as a bit counterintuitive in terms of what America first is. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=675.82s)]
*  And then you also say that in terms of what the next administration ought to do, and again, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=681.98s)]
*  this is theoretical. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=687.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying that Trump endorsed any particular aspect of this, but you do say that the United [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=688.6600000000001s)]
*  States would continue to arm Ukraine. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=694.0600000000001s)]
*  You say that Ukraine would not be asked to relinquish the goal of regaining all of its [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=696.94s)]
*  territory and that a negotiated end state should include provisions in which we establish [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=700.62s)]
*  a long term security architecture for Ukraine's defense. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=706.62s)]
*  Now, when Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine, I obviously, I listened to his speech. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=710.86s)]
*  I've read it several times. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=715.9s)]
*  I've read many of his other remarks. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=716.98s)]
*  And one of the core grievances that he has articulated is that the U.S. and NATO have [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=719.62s)]
*  basically established their military architecture inside Ukraine to a degree that is intolerable [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=727.5s)]
*  for Russia. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=735.34s)]
*  It encroaches on their sovereignty. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=736.34s)]
*  That's the thrust of what Putin has said. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=737.78s)]
*  And so if you're suggesting that a peace plan, or I know you've disputed the Reuters characterization [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=740.74s)]
*  that was a peace plan, but whatever kind of future prognosis this document constitutes [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=747.02s)]
*  for how U.S. policy in Ukraine should be oriented, if it includes arming Ukraine, if it includes [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  making no territorial concessions to Russia, at least in a permanent or semi-permanent [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=760.0600000000001s)]
*  way, if it concludes shoring up or intensifying U.S. and Ukraine bilateral military ties, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=764.5s)]
*  how does any of that address any of the core grievances of Putin that he claims are what [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=774.5400000000001s)]
*  spurred him to launch the war in the first place? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=779.86s)]
*  I guess my question is, isn't this a recipe for just perpetual war to be perpetuated? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=782.22s)]
*  I mean, none of the structural conditions that gave rise to the war seem like they would [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=787.58s)]
*  be addressed by this. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=792.58s)]
*  These are all good points. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=795.1800000000001s)]
*  And I might add, we have a mess right now that was created by Joe Biden. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=796.1800000000001s)]
*  And now we may have another president, Donald Trump, who has to solve this mess. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=801.2600000000001s)]
*  And let's be blunt. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=805.7s)]
*  It may not be solvable, although I think Trump has a pretty good chance of solving it. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=806.7800000000001s)]
*  Now, you know, in my paper, we discuss at length Putin's views about Ukraine, how he [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=810.7800000000001s)]
*  doesn't believe that Ukraine is a state, he doesn't believe in the nationality of the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=817.7800000000001s)]
*  Ukrainian people. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=822.1s)]
*  He does talk about the threats he thinks that NATO membership, EU membership poses to Russia. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=823.22s)]
*  I don't agree with any of those things. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=829.26s)]
*  But Biden knew that when he was dangling NATO membership in front of Zelensky. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=831.3s)]
*  And I think it created a situation coupled with Biden's weakness that really tempted [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=836.7s)]
*  Putin to stage this invasion. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=841.5s)]
*  But the question about what could have happened in 2022, once Russia invaded, Ukraine was [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=843.58s)]
*  doing pretty well pushing the Russians back, surprisingly well, because the Russian army [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=849.1s)]
*  was much more backward, much, much less, less, less was not well equipped. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=854.46s)]
*  And there was a window there that if Ukraine had gotten had received the weapons that needed, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=861.34s)]
*  let's say by the summer, early fall 2022, it may have substantially pushed Ukraine back. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=866.22s)]
*  Is this an ideal situation? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=871.9000000000001s)]
*  No. But I'm just talking about the mess that Biden caused after the fall of 2022. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=873.34s)]
*  Russia was well dug in. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=879.1s)]
*  And this arm Ukraine for as long as it takes approach simply made no sense. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=880.86s)]
*  And we're not supporting that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=885.34s)]
*  I do think that we should take NATO membership off the table, which is in the chapter that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=887.1s)]
*  you read, because I think that's too provocative to the Russians to start negotiations. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=893.1s)]
*  And I think that to get Ukraine to come to the table, we have to make some kind of agreement [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=897.9s)]
*  to arm Ukraine to stop Russia from invading. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=902.62s)]
*  It's not a perfect situation, but I think this is the best way to stop this conflict. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=905.42s)]
*  I'm with Donald Trump. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  We have to stop the killing and resolve this through negotiations. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=910.6999999999999s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, but did not the Trump administration also have as a matter of policy [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=916.2199999999999s)]
*  a commitment to Ukraine that it would eventually join NATO? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=924.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean, Mike Pompeo went to Ukraine and reiterated as a matter of US policy that began [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=928.38s)]
*  in 2008 at the Bucharest summit, at the NATO summit under George W. Bush, that Ukraine and Georgia [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=935.9s)]
*  would eventually join NATO. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=944.38s)]
*  And that was repeated as a matter of policy in the Trump administration, including by Pompeo [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=945.74s)]
*  verbally at many points when he was dealing with Zelensky or with other Ukraine officials. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=953.18s)]
*  So if it was provocative for Biden, and I don't even necessarily disagree that it was provocative, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=958.86s)]
*  but if it was provocative for Biden to be dangling NATO membership ahead of the Ukraine invasion [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=966.86s)]
*  to Ukraine, was it also not provocative for the Trump administration to be retaining that same [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=972.94s)]
*  policy? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=979.74s)]
*  Maybe less flamboyant in their expression of it, I suppose, but it was the same policy, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=980.62s)]
*  fundamentally, wasn't it? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=986.78s)]
*  No, it wasn't at all. I think flamboyant is a good word to use here. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=989.5s)]
*  Trump believed in a working relationship with US adversaries and talking to them. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=993.74s)]
*  Biden hasn't talked to Putin since February 2022. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=999.34s)]
*  And my understanding is that it was not Trump's position to extend NATO membership to Ukraine, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1002.7s)]
*  although I haven't asked him this. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1007.9s)]
*  But it's pretty clear the US wanted to find a way to get along with the Russians, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1009.58s)]
*  to talk with them. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1013.98s)]
*  I was on the plane on Air Force One when we went to Helsinki for Trump's meeting with Putin. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1015.02s)]
*  I think there's going to be a big difference between the Biden administration and the Trump [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1020.54s)]
*  administration. There's going to be tough policies towards our adversaries, but there's also going [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1024.54s)]
*  to be dialogue. There's going to be an effort to work out our differences and lower tensions [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1028.54s)]
*  through negotiations. We're not going to have an American president likening Putin to Hamas [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1033.26s)]
*  and calling him a war criminal. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1039.02s)]
*  And Trump has made it very clear that's not productive. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1040.7s)]
*  It's not something a president of the United States should be doing. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1043.42s)]
*  Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal on Earth. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1046.54s)]
*  We have to find a way to be tough with Russia, but also to live with Russia. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1049.02s)]
*  I want to play you a clip. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1054.94s)]
*  This is Donald Trump in July of 2023 being interviewed by Maria Bartiromo. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1056.46s)]
*  And he gives his prognosis for a future negotiation with Zelensky and Putin. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1062.14s)]
*  So let's hear that. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1069.9s)]
*  What I'm saying is that I know Zelensky very well and I know Putin very well, even better. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1074.0600000000002s)]
*  And I had a good relationship, very good with both of them. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1079.5s)]
*  I would tell Zelensky, no more, you got to make a deal. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1083.1000000000001s)]
*  I would tell Putin, if you don't make a deal, we're going to give them a lot. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1087.02s)]
*  We're going to give more than they ever got if we have to. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1090.78s)]
*  OK, so that sort of winds up with your critique of Biden in that you're saying that Biden and [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1094.0600000000002s)]
*  others have echoed this critique that Biden did not expedite weapons to Ukraine quickly [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1100.62s)]
*  enough in the early phase of the war. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1108.2199999999998s)]
*  And Trump is suggesting there that he might be even willing to escalate in Ukraine in [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1110.1399999999999s)]
*  order to force some sort of settlement, including by threatening Putin that he would [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1117.34s)]
*  send more weapons to Ukraine than ever before. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1122.78s)]
*  Right, so could you imagine that in service of achieving some kind of settlement to the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1125.34s)]
*  war, Trump famously says he can solve the war in 24 hours, although he gives no details on that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1130.78s)]
*  But could a way that could be achieved, could that possibly be actually escalating the warfare [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1135.9799999999998s)]
*  in Ukraine and removing some of the constraints that maybe Biden has imposed, whether it's [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1143.82s)]
*  striking targets inside Russia or certain longer range missile systems being deployed [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1151.18s)]
*  to Ukraine? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1158.22s)]
*  Trump suggests that that might be one of the tools in his arsenal to potentially put pressure on [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1159.5800000000002s)]
*  Putin. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1165.8200000000002s)]
*  But that would be sort of ironic because, you know, if you look at the conventional media [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1166.14s)]
*  depiction of America first or macro Republicans, everybody kind of assumes that they're against [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1169.42s)]
*  Ukraine or whatever, right, which is silly. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1173.74s)]
*  But it could be the case that Trump, if he were to get back into office, might well escalate in [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1176.38s)]
*  Ukraine and, you know, hopefully, supposedly or potentially to achieve an expedited conclusion [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1182.94s)]
*  to the war. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1191.66s)]
*  But still, an escalation in Ukraine would be very serious and it could potentially spiral [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1192.0600000000002s)]
*  into any number of directions. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1197.5s)]
*  Is that an accurate sort of assessment of what Trump potentially might be looking to do? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1199.34s)]
*  Again, this is all hypothetical, but what do you make of that? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1208.7s)]
*  Well, first of all, I would say the Biden administration sees the war against Russia [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1212.62s)]
*  for virtue signaling, basically to call out the Russians. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1218.3799999999999s)]
*  There's been no interest in by Biden in entering the war. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1222.1399999999999s)]
*  And why would Zelensky want to end the war when the US doesn't want to end the war? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1225.34s)]
*  It's not a coincidence of four successive presidents, Bush, Obama and Biden. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1228.86s)]
*  Russia invaded neighboring states, but not during Trump because of Trump's leadership [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1234.86s)]
*  and because he was a decisive president. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1239.8999999999999s)]
*  I think if Trump is elected, it's going to be a whole new ballgame. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1241.82s)]
*  I think Putin will deal with him. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1245.18s)]
*  I think Putin will respect Trump as president. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1246.7s)]
*  We'll see a president prepared to restore American deterrence and strength. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1249.26s)]
*  And it's going to be tough with Zelensky. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1253.18s)]
*  He's going to tell Zelensky time is up. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1254.7s)]
*  We're not going to provide you weapons forever. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1257.02s)]
*  You must enter peace negotiations. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1259.26s)]
*  I might add, I'm not speaking for President Trump, I'm not part of the campaign. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1261.66s)]
*  But my prediction is this would be the approach. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1265.26s)]
*  I think it will be well received. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1267.98s)]
*  And I think Putin will be told that there will be consequences [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1269.74s)]
*  if he doesn't agree to negotiate. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1272.7s)]
*  But I think he will negotiate because Trump wants to improve relations with Russia. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1274.46s)]
*  Biden has no interest in doing that. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1279.42s)]
*  He wants to use Russia as a punching bag. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1281.58s)]
*  That has to end. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1284.22s)]
*  The more we do that, the more we push Russia towards China. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1285.26s)]
*  It's a really ridiculous position that's undermining global security. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1288.54s)]
*  I think Trump has it right in making a priority of ending this war as soon as possible. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1292.86s)]
*  So would that include rolling back the sanctions that have been [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1298.54s)]
*  put on Russia under the Biden administration? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1303.26s)]
*  In terms of integrating Russia back into the international system, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1306.62s)]
*  you would probably have to eliminate some of these incredibly overbearing sanctions [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1310.8600000000001s)]
*  that have been imposed on Russia. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1315.18s)]
*  It's unclear, like much with the Trump second term forecast, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1318.6200000000001s)]
*  as to what his attitude would be with respect to sanctions. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1324.3000000000002s)]
*  You have people like Robert O'Brien, who is the national security advisor [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1327.42s)]
*  for a portion of the first Trump term, suggesting that a way for Trump, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1330.7800000000002s)]
*  once he gets back into office, to force a settlement would be to actually [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1336.54s)]
*  accelerate or intensify US sanctions on Russia and go even further than the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1340.86s)]
*  Biden administration has by, for example, sanctioning the Russian central bank [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1347.02s)]
*  and that sort of thing. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1351.26s)]
*  Trump could escalate arming Ukraine. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1356.06s)]
*  He could escalate the sanctions regimen that's been put on Russia. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1358.3s)]
*  This is quite a lot of escalation, potentially. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1363.5s)]
*  Obviously, we can't say with certainty what he would do, right? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1365.74s)]
*  Because a lot of it is kept under wraps. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1367.9s)]
*  But do you see any potential where this approach ends up seriously escalating the war [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1370.7s)]
*  and maybe doesn't produce the peace settlement or the ceasefire that some are claiming [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1379.34s)]
*  it will result in? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1386.38s)]
*  Otherwise, I'm asking you, what are the downside risks of this sort of approach? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1387.26s)]
*  Well, I think Trump is a dealmaker and you don't go into a deal not offering both parties [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1392.94s)]
*  something and I think in all likelihood that there would be some offer to lower some [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1399.98s)]
*  sanctions on Russia. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1404.62s)]
*  But what I argued with General Kellogg in our article is that Russia will not have a [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1406.1399999999999s)]
*  normal relationship with the rest of the world, the United States and Europe, until it [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1411.8999999999999s)]
*  strikes an agreement with Ukraine that's going to return all of its territory. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1417.26s)]
*  That may not happen until Putin leaves the scene. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1422.3s)]
*  But I think that there's a real possibility of ending this war, beginning negotiations. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1425.5s)]
*  I don't think Ukraine should give up its territorial claims to get back its territory. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1430.06s)]
*  But practically speaking, that can't be done right now. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1434.3s)]
*  Ukraine is not going to use force of arms to take back its territory. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1437.5s)]
*  It's going to lose a whole generation of young men fighting a hopeless war of attrition. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1440.78s)]
*  I think that's immoral. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1445.74s)]
*  And we have to find a different approach. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1447.1s)]
*  There's people on the right and left calling for that right now. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1448.9399999999998s)]
*  I think that's where Trump will be. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1451.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMpNOjjHznA&t=1455.1s)]
