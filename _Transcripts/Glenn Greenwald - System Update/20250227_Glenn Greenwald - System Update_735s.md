# Why Russia Justifies Its War Against Ukraine: With Key Russian Analyst Aleksandr Dugin
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI)
*  One of the things that Western propaganda is designed to do is to prevent anyone from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=0.0s)]
*  ever thinking about the world from the perspective of any country deemed adversarial or hostile. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=10.38s)]
*  Can you describe to people why it is? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=18.94s)]
*  Well, first of all, describe to people how Western involvement and U.S. involvement in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=21.98s)]
*  Ukraine has looked since at least 2014 or even going back if you want and why that is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=26.66s)]
*  threatening to Russia? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=31.78s)]
*  So in our eyes, in our society, not just in mine, but that was... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=34.7s)]
*  The Russian society. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=40.5s)]
*  The Russian society, yes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=41.5s)]
*  The Russian people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=42.5s)]
*  That was a kind of clear hostile intervention of the power that really hated Russia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=43.5s)]
*  So we added ideology, walk, globalism, liberalism that contradicted to our traditional values [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=51.98s)]
*  and actions of the West, collective West, on the geopolitical level. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=64.94s)]
*  So that was the kind of combination between ideological hostility and geopolitical hostility. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=72.12s)]
*  We have seen, we have interpreted that as creation of artificial anti-Russia in Ukraine [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=80.94s)]
*  because Ukrainians are the part of the same people, the same church, and the part of us [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=90.38000000000001s)]
*  was cut and transformed in an artificial way by some kind of PsyOps in something radically [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=96.54s)]
*  different aligned to us and the absolute contradiction. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=106.02s)]
*  So that was creation of the artificial identity with great racist nationalism and anti-Russian [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  nationalism, and supported by the globalists, by the liberals, and by all the countries [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=123.1s)]
*  starting from the United States to European Union. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=133.61999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes some leaders, European leaders at that time were... [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=137.34s)]
*  Which time do you mean? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  Do you mean 2014? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  2014 something. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=144.89999999999998s)]
*  But starting from that and more and more and more, some of European leaders were a bit [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  reluctant to promote this aggression, but this time United States, Obama's administration, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  Nuland for other globalists, democrats, they pushed this agenda against European leaders [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=163.74s)]
*  in order to escalate relations between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=173.9s)]
*  And after that, the other European leaders followed this tendency, they were involved [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=179.34s)]
*  more and more and more in Russophobia, and now paradoxically, the region of the hostility, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=188.7s)]
*  the hatred to Russia and most support to Ukraine is not from the United States but from European Union. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=197.06s)]
*  I guess the question that a lot of people have listening to that is, yeah, that was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=206.46s)]
*  done in Ukraine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's a separate country, it's a sovereign country, was once part of the Soviet Union [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  with Russia but no longer is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=217.62s)]
*  Why is it threatening to Russia, if it is, to have such active US and EU involvement [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=220.02s)]
*  in Ukraine? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  Because Ukraine in the history didn't exist. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=229.02s)]
*  It begins with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the borders were not based on the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=234.14s)]
*  ethnical, geopolitical, historical experience, that was just administrative province of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=242.26s)]
*  Tsarist Empire first and after that of the Soviet Union. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=248.66s)]
*  Nobody cared about what ethnic groups, what religious groups lived there, because that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=252.14s)]
*  was the part of the same political and administrative space, the same state, and that was just [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  the province of it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=269.06s)]
*  So nobody resolved the problem, you belong to this ethnic group or to the other, they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  were considered to be the part of the same Russian world, the same Russian people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=281.85999999999996s)]
*  And the collapse of the Soviet Union was made by the administrative borders of the entities [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=287.18s)]
*  that never existed politically before. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=297.1s)]
*  But there was a Ukraine, I mean, we talked before the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  There was not Ukraine as state. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=303.86s)]
*  Right, but there was a Ukrainian identity. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  As province, as state within the Soviet Union. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=308.3s)]
*  That was kind of Nebraska or Utah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=312.98s)]
*  So you could say that is state, but it is not the national state, sovereign national [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=316.38s)]
*  state. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=321.06s)]
*  That was just the province with very small amount of autonomy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=322.06s)]
*  So that was just the part of unitarian state. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=328.46s)]
*  And the collapse of the Soviet Union gave to this artificial entity the status of sovereignty. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=332.46s)]
*  Because the first leaders, Yeltsin, believed that we will be friends because we belong [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=340.28s)]
*  to the same civilization, and that was not the case. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=347.2s)]
*  So when we have remarked, when we have understood that there is some anti-Russian movement, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=350.44s)]
*  political supported by the West, already in the 90s, but in the 90s nobody reacted properly [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  the threats and the challenges from the West. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  But with Putin we started to take in consideration these processes in Ukraine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=371.28s)]
*  We tried to convince them to stay with us. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=375.79999999999995s)]
*  We supported candidates from the east of Ukraine. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=379.52s)]
*  We tried to convince oligarchs and political, economical elite to deal with us, not prohibiting [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=384.67999999999995s)]
*  them to deal with Europe or with the United States. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=391.52s)]
*  But conserving some balance, natural balance, neutrality, some friendly relations with us, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=396.6s)]
*  friendly relations with EU, but in some limits. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=405.56s)]
*  And all the presidents of the Ukraine, including Yushchenko, who was very, very pro-Western, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  they accepted this balance. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=421.72s)]
*  So one president more pro-Russian, the other pro-Western, pro-Russian, pro-Western, but [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=423.52s)]
*  in the same... [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=429.08s)]
*  Not hostile toward Russia. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=430.64s)]
*  Not radically hostile to Russia. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=432.79999999999995s)]
*  And the coup on Maidan was precisely to destroy this balance. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  That was deliberately the step to move, to put the radical nationalist circles at the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=442.72s)]
*  top, provoke Russian reaction in Crimea and elsewhere, and to divide, to cut Ukraine from [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=453.12s)]
*  Russia, including eastern part that originally in the beginning were almost absolutely in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  But under propaganda, under demonization, under Western suggestions, that turned into [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=469.92s)]
*  the bloody mess. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=479.24s)]
*  So this anti-Russian ideology has won over Ukrainian society. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=480.44s)]
*  And they started to hate their own history, their own religion, thinking that the West [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=487.32s)]
*  is paradise and Russia is hell. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=494.68s)]
*  And they were Russians that would like to escape so-called Russian hell that never existed. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=497.64s)]
*  Why is that a threat to Russia if that happens in this other sovereign state of Ukraine? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=505.88s)]
*  Why is it a threat to Russia? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=512.56s)]
*  So you're talking here about internal Ukrainian politics. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=514.72s)]
*  But that is not so, because first of all, what is sovereign? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=519.4s)]
*  If you are great power, only the other great powers are sovereign, in your opinion. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=524.44s)]
*  All the rest is a hypocrisy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=530.0s)]
*  So if, for example, you imagine Mexico creating anti-US government and— [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=531.72s)]
*  Or China doing so in Mexico. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=540.32s)]
*  If China did so in Mexico, I guess it would be the analogy, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=542.7600000000001s)]
*  China comes, instills anti-American sentiment. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=546.36s)]
*  And everybody in Mexico would think, let us hang the Yankee on the trees, as was the case [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=550.8s)]
*  in Ukraine, and supply with a huge amount of the weapon and try to provoke United States [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=560.84s)]
*  on the border. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=569.92s)]
*  So finally, you would understand us. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=570.92s)]
*  That is not about neutrality or sovereignty. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=574.52s)]
*  That is the direct challenge. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=578.68s)]
*  And when you see the other geopolitical power, Western geopolitical power supporting that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=581.52s)]
*  and igniting that, fueling that, fueling that, so you could understand Russian reaction. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=588.84s)]
*  We acted very mild. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=597.56s)]
*  Putin was the last who finally decided to intervene. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=599.88s)]
*  So there were sentiments inside Russia that that should have happened earlier. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=604.66s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=609.38s)]
*  Now, Putin as well, he has acknowledged that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=610.38s)]
*  So that was my opinion. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=614.78s)]
*  But starting from 2014, I claimed that continuation of the conflict is inevitable because collective [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=616.74s)]
*  West and the globalist, they will not stop. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=627.18s)]
*  They will concentrate the powers. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=630.58s)]
*  They will weaponize Ukraine in order to attack us, to get back the Eastern territories. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=635.2s)]
*  And this Minsk talks will lead to nothing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=644.7s)]
*  I declared that starting from 2014. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=649.62s)]
*  And they have a kind of repressions against themselves. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=653.1s)]
*  I would cut from all the channels, all the TV channels, so not repression, but ostracism. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=656.9s)]
*  So something like that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=666.74s)]
*  So that was not physical or juridical, but I was fired from Moscow State University. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=667.74s)]
*  So because I said, I continue to say what I consider the situation is. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=675.26s)]
*  You feel vindicated. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=685.66s)]
*  Too huge price to that. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=689.1s)]
*  So I don't mean you're celebrating. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=690.54s)]
*  I just mean you believe that that perspective that the West was intent on expanding and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=692.3399999999999s)]
*  expanding. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXILh2U5XI&t=697.4599999999999s)]
