# Glenn Takes Your Questions On Trump's Cabinet, The G20 Summit, and More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM)
*  Good evening everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the after show here on Locals. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=7.36s)]
*  As you know, the minute we start, we don't do anything ever. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=10.44s)]
*  We don't even think about doing anything until we first fulfill the top priority, which is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  introducing our canine co-host. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=18.0s)]
*  And tonight we have Juno sitting there in Victor's lap. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=19.68s)]
*  And then here we have Kuma, who's a little bit agitated. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=23.36s)]
*  He was very calm right until we started and then he started just walking around. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=26.64s)]
*  Kuma. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  He gets a stage fright, Glenn. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=32.56s)]
*  And he does want to make sure he's in every camera angle. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=33.56s)]
*  So that's that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=36.88s)]
*  And then last, we have... [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=37.88s)]
*  And least. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  I don't want to say but not least because it's not true. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  But I don't want to say and least because it's rude. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=43.88s)]
*  Is Victor Pougy, my co-host, the show's director? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=46.68s)]
*  It is me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=49.0s)]
*  I am back. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=50.0s)]

*  I'm back. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=136.0s)]
*  I'm back. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=137.0s)]
*  happens all the time. But I guess like when it happens all the time, the city's somewhat ready for it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=138.0s)]
*  It just threw the city out of whack. But it was good. We all had fun. People from Rio, not us because [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=141.84s)]
*  we're... People were really excited like they would see Macron walking around on the beach in shorts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=149.52s)]
*  He would talk, stop and take selfies. I mean, Macron really knows how to play the game. Yeah, no, he's a good politician. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=153.68s)]
*  He knows. He was like jogging, talking to people. Just loving the beach, talking to every like, you know, vendor, street vendor. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=158.64s)]
*  People love Macron. Yeah, exactly. Because of that. Exactly. No, that was very true. Anyways, but G20, all the leaders, there was, as always, with each thing, there's a big photo with all the leaders. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=166.32s)]
*  And people noticed that Joe Biden as well as some other people weren't in the... No, just Joe Biden was missing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=178.16s)]
*  Just Joe Biden. There was, so basically, traditionally, the G20 leaders, all 20 of them take a group photo, as you might expect when they go to these events. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=183.84s)]
*  And that's the one thing they took one and everybody was in the photo, the 19 leaders, and the one that was missing was Joe Biden. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  And he had previously given this bizarre press conference, for those of you who didn't know that we were just referencing, where he was speaking in the Amazon, the middle of the Amazon, at a podium to a press conference. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  And then once he was done, he turned around and just started walking aimlessly into the woods. Because you know when he gives those press conferences in the White House, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=211.68s)]
*  when he's done, he just like turns around and walks back to that back room. I think he thought he was in the White House. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=220.4s)]
*  I think there was probably a way back for him there. But it's just so weird to walk into the woods. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=226.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just like, especially because of the way he walks. Like if it had been more purposeful, you'd be like, oh, there must be a place. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=232.4s)]
*  But he was just like an old man lost in the forest. So anyway, there was a New York Times article on this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=238.64s)]
*  They did a group photo in, I think, a very well placed photo showing the wonders of Rio. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  And you know, Joe Biden wasn't there. So of course, the New York Times went to ask about this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=255.04s)]
*  So I'm going to quote the New York Times now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=261.2s)]
*  Well, they asked, who did they ask? They asked the Brazilian minister, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  Around what is it? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=265.68s)]
*  No, but they asked the government. They asked the minister. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=266.64s)]
*  They looked for official questions, like submitted an official question. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  And then the Ministry of Communications for the Brazilian government, who is like the person who would answer officially for that, explained why Joe Biden was not in the photo. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=271.92s)]
*  I'm quoting from New York Times now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=284.0s)]
*  Back in Rio on Tuesday, world leaders gathered for another group photo, this time ensuring that Mr. Biden would be in the picture. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=285.36s)]
*  Asked why the leaders had not waited for Mr. Biden the first time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=291.76s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=295.92s)]
*  Paulo Pimenta, Brazil's Minister of Communications, said Brazilians prioritize punctuality. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=297.44s)]
*  When it's time, it's time, Mr. Pimenta said on Tuesday. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=303.6s)]
*  The reason this is the funniest thing ever. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=308.16s)]
*  As we all know, Brazilians are very punctual. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=310.64s)]
*  The funniest thing is Brazil is basically the least punctual place I've ever been in. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=312.64s)]
*  It's less punctual and organized than Italy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=319.04s)]
*  I always call it the anti-Germany. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=322.72s)]
*  I did a book tour once in Germany. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=324.56s)]
*  When you do a book tour, what happens is you can stay in your hotel and then you have in conference rooms, they just have one media person after the next come in and interview you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=328.24s)]
*  Or on video or by print. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  Your publisher stacks these one after the next because you only have a day or two in Berlin and then you're on to the next city. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes I would go up to my room if I had 15 minutes between interviews. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=344.64s)]
*  Not very punctual myself, especially after living in Brazil for so long. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=350.8s)]
*  I'm not joking. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=354.88s)]
*  If I was 60 seconds late, they would send up the woman and she would bang on my door and she'd be like, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=356.88s)]
*  Glenn, Mr. Grimmold, it's time to go. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=363.2s)]
*  We have to go. We must go. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=366.8s)]
*  The interview was at 12.15. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=368.16s)]
*  This was at 12.16. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=370.16s)]
*  Germany, everything was punctual. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=371.92s)]
*  When it's time, it's time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=374.24s)]
*  In Germany, Brazil is the anti-Germany. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  I actually learned something I hated at first and then learned to love, which is that not only does nothing start in time here, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=378.08s)]
*  but if you get to somewhere 45 minutes after the scheduled time, you're considered impolitely early. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  Things are not supposed to start. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=394.08s)]
*  If you say, oh yeah, just come over at 7 and then you do come over to my place at 7, I'm going to be showering. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=395.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=400.56s)]
*  I had somebody, about two weeks ago, someone was supposed to come over at a specific time. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=401.06s)]
*  Of course, once that time got there, I was wandering around. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=407.84s)]
*  I was nowhere near ready. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=410.0s)]
*  They got there on the dot. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  I was so angry. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=413.44s)]
*  I was like, this is so rude. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=414.48s)]
*  Who gets there on the dot? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=416.4s)]
*  That's the Brazilian way of thinking. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=417.6s)]
*  To hear him justify why they omitted Joe Biden from the photo. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=419.52s)]
*  They could have just said anything else. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=423.2s)]
*  They would have just said, oh, the president of Vietnam needed to run up. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=424.32s)]
*  That's why we need to gather photos. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=429.76s)]
*  Brazilians are punctual. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=432.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=434.32s)]
*  It would be like saying, you know, in the United States, Americans hate fast food or Americans hate consumption. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=434.56s)]
*  We Italians, we do not like to be loud. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=439.44s)]
*  We don't like corruption. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=442.64s)]
*  We don't like being loud. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  We don't like the lack of organization. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=446.88s)]
*  It's just the funniest thing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=447.2s)]
*  The fact that he could say that in the straight face theater time, like, oh, he was a minute late. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  Here in Brazil, we Brazilians are globally known. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=452.24s)]
*  When it's time, it's time. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=455.28s)]
*  That was a cold shock for me when I moved to bravado and went to live in Singapore. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=456.88s)]
*  I discovered that there was a difference between saying like one and saying 115 because for me, it's like, yeah, one, 115. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=460.96s)]
*  It's all the same. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=469.2s)]
*  It's all like before 130. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's this phrase like whenever you're late and you get really late, like 20, 25 minutes, 30 minutes late. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=473.2s)]
*  It's really like a doctor appointment day where you're expected to show up a little bit more reasonably less late. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=479.04s)]
*  And then someone will text you and say, where are you? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=484.08s)]
*  Are you coming? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  And then there's this phrase in Portuguese, which is very ambiguous. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  It just means like, yeah, I'm getting there. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=491.84s)]
*  But it could mean like two minutes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  It could mean like 15 minutes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=495.68s)]
*  It could mean an hour. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=496.88s)]
*  Like, yeah, I'm getting there. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm on the process of arriving. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=499.68s)]
*  So yeah, that was amusing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=503.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=507.52s)]
*  So we have questions from listeners. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=507.84s)]
*  We do have. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=510.32s)]
*  The first one, question one comes from May 4679. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=511.68s)]
*  And the question is, what are your thoughts on the shutting down of Infowars? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=518.0s)]
*  I think that the case that was brought against Alex Jones and Infowars for defamation, intentional [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=524.8s)]
*  inflection of emotional distress was on its merits reasonable and valid because Alex Jones [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=535.36s)]
*  did essentially not just say that Sandy Hook was staged. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=545.92s)]
*  He accused the parents who were of feigning grief when in fact they were participants in this [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=552.32s)]
*  fake event that was designed to generate opposition to guns. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=559.28s)]
*  That was what Alex Jones said. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=562.64s)]
*  And as a result, Alex Jones has a huge audience. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=563.6s)]
*  He did and still does. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=566.24s)]
*  People have been listening to him for years. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  They really trust him. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=569.36s)]
*  And these parents got tons of death threats at the end of their lives at a time when they [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=571.44s)]
*  were dealing with the incomprehensible grief of losing a five-year-old or a six-year-old [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=575.84s)]
*  because they got murdered by a gun in school. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=582.64s)]
*  So I don't find the case itself to be outrageous. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  I can understand that case. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=589.44s)]
*  I think even Alex Jones admits that what he did was wrong and it was a bad mistake. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=591.2s)]
*  I interviewed him about that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=596.96s)]
*  And there was a documentary about that where he talked at length about why he thinks it's [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=598.0s)]
*  a mistake, why he regrets it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=602.08s)]
*  But this judgment of in excess of a billion dollars, do you know how rare it is for even [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=603.2s)]
*  mega corporations when they get found guilty or found liable of doing something extremely [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=611.12s)]
*  destructive, would ever have a judgment in excess of a billion dollars? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=616.4s)]
*  It's so clearly an abuse of the justice system to try and forever destroy someone who for [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  a long time has had a big impact in a way that the establishment hates. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=628.0s)]
*  He was a major voice in helping Donald Trump win the 2016 election, the 2016 primary. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=632.56s)]
*  He put him on his show all the time. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=637.6s)]
*  He had a gigantic audience. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=639.28s)]
*  This is somebody they wanted to destroy for a long time. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=641.04s)]
*  And the fact that they ruined him, they ruined him with a judgment that never would have [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  happened had he not been who he is and not had the political ideology he has. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=649.12s)]
*  It's just another case of extreme urbanization of the justice system as a way of crushing [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  dissent. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=660.0s)]
*  And that's going to happen more and more. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=660.88s)]
*  This is the kind of strategy that they're using to bring civil liability against people [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=662.24s)]
*  who are dissidents to bankrupt them if they can't put them in jail because of the First Amendment. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=666.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=670.4s)]
*  The second question, which is not so much a question but more of a comment, comes from [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  Jora. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=677.04s)]
*  The LaFritta interview was the best Locals content ever. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=677.52s)]
*  What a great interview. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=680.88s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know how you could respond to that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=681.76s)]
*  Well, the thing is, I think we've ended up putting on the Rumble page as well. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  We did. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=689.5999999999999s)]
*  We put it on Locals first. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=690.16s)]
*  Yeah, everywhere now. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=690.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=693.52s)]
*  And I think we had him on our show. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=693.92s)]
*  We did. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=697.12s)]
*  We had him on before about his reporting about when he used to be the people who would have [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=697.68s)]
*  left the- [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=703.76s)]
*  The extremism of the West Bank who were blocking the settler movement that was blocking [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  a truck to get into Gaza. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  And they would take their kids and teach their kids. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  And his reporting has been pretty extraordinary. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, you go to Israel right now, it's basically like martial law. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=714.8s)]
*  Israel, the Israeli media is under a full censorship. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=718.4s)]
*  No Israeli media outlet can publish anything about Gaza, about Lebanon, about the war, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=721.68s)]
*  criticizing Netanyahu without getting the permission of censorship, the censors, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  the official censors. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=730.7199999999999s)]
*  People are getting arrested in droves for social media posts. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  If any of the Arab Israeli citizens express any kind of sympathy for the people of Gaza, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=736.16s)]
*  they get investigated, they get their lives ruined. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=742.0s)]
*  There was actually an article in the New York Times about this 24-year-old girl who [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=744.56s)]
*  grew up in her life in Israel, an Israeli citizen, Arab Israeli. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=748.9599999999999s)]
*  And because of like two or three posts, she was expelled from her school. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  She was prosecuted. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=756.32s)]
*  She was detained. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=758.0s)]
*  She was accused of terrorism. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=758.88s)]
*  It's considered a terrorism offense. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=760.48s)]
*  So there's no liberty in Israel to speak of basically. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  And he has been wandering around just doing dangerous reporting to his great credit. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=765.6s)]
*  That's designed to show a lot of the steadier sides of Israel that don't get normally shown. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=772.96s)]
*  And if you're doing that, you have to know the Israelis [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=778.1600000000001s)]
*  are a really authoritarian government, to put that mildly. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=781.6s)]
*  You have to know if you're doing that, there's a risk that you're going to get, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=787.12s)]
*  you're not going to be well treated. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=790.32s)]
*  And I think the only reason why that interview was so, why it resonated so much is because [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=793.12s)]
*  it's not just that he got arrested for his journalism. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=800.0s)]
*  It's that his journalism has been so great. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  He's, I think, very articulate about his journalism. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=804.08s)]
*  You can see how sincere he is. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=807.36s)]
*  There's no drama to it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=808.72s)]
*  There's no, I got verbally to it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  He just told the story of what happened. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  It's so jarring that they would do that to an American journalist because as I [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  kept thinking, if they're doing that to an American journalist, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=816.72s)]
*  not just arresting them, but psychologically, you know, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=820.16s)]
*  harming them and torturing them. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  Imagine what they're doing to Palestinians inside those dungeons. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=825.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=829.52s)]
*  And I think the fact that like a lot of his reporting is also like, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=830.4s)]
*  just opening the camera like in Israel and just letting like, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=835.52s)]
*  just showing what's like, he doesn't need to like, you know, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=839.36s)]
*  he doesn't do like undercover stuff. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=842.0s)]
*  He doesn't pretend to be, you know, doing something to ages. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=843.92s)]
*  He goes in and interviews. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=847.92s)]
*  He goes in and interviews. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=848.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=849.6s)]
*  Show like, and it's amazing what people are saying. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=849.84s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=853.12s)]
*  And it just, we often say that like you can find honest reporting in Israeli media much [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=854.0s)]
*  more so than in American media when they're reporting about the war in Gaza and all this stuff, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=859.28s)]
*  which I think is a damning condemnation of American media that is operating [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=864.72s)]
*  outside any constraints of official censorship, but it's still not telling the story. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=869.36s)]
*  Oh, you like Harrods, another Israeli media, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=874.16s)]
*  constantly publish arguments about whether there are war crimes, whether it's genocide. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=877.6s)]
*  Calling it genocide is, it does get done. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=882.72s)]
*  It's still like most Israelis even willing to hate and not who are in general supportive of the war. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=885.92s)]
*  They're angry about this war crimes accusation, but they, in the Israeli media, are much more [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=891.12s)]
*  willing to express severe criticism of the Israeli government, the Israeli war than you [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=899.04s)]
*  would ever hear in a mainstream American media. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=903.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=907.68s)]
*  Question three comes from Mine Critter. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=908.24s)]
*  What do you think about forcing presidential candidates to reveal their [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=910.7199999999999s)]
*  potential cabinet nominations before being elected? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=913.92s)]
*  Wouldn't it be great if more debates could be held between secretaries of state, et cetera? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=916.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting idea. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  Actually, it is true that who you select says a great deal about the kind of government that you [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=923.28s)]
*  intend to construct. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=932.0s)]
*  I do think there'd probably be an argument that it's so premature for us to select without having one, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  but you could almost see, I don't know if a law, but like a practice where people say who their [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=941.76s)]
*  attorney general would be, who their secretary of defense would be, who their secretary of state [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=947.36s)]
*  would be, who their chief of staff would be, who their national security advisor would be, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=950.0s)]
*  who their secretary of treasury would be. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=953.76s)]
*  That would be a very meaningful way of evaluating candidates, and in the case of Trump, it would [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=956.32s)]
*  have told a lot about what kind of government he intends to pursue. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=962.48s)]
*  And same with Kamala. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=967.84s)]
*  The illusion of what the Democratic Party prize pretended is would have been completely undermined [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=970.32s)]
*  had she been forced to identify the people from Goldman Sachs or from... [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=976.88s)]
*  Or even who would be like Secretary of State. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=981.36s)]
*  Pro-war think tanks, what? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=983.04s)]
*  Or even who would be like Secretary of State, who would be attorney general. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=984.48s)]
*  No, that's what I mean. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  They would come from big law firms that behind that, like that's who would be attorney general [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=988.0s)]
*  or prosecutors. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=993.36s)]
*  Or she needs to tell, like, are you going to keep Lena Cohn or not? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=994.24s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=997.36s)]
*  I suppose during the campaign, a lot of these decisions aren't made and you have to [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1000.64s)]
*  not reveal, I guess like... [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1004.64s)]
*  It would be hard to make it mandatory. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1008.08s)]
*  Because you're trying to please different factions, you know, like you're promising [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1009.52s)]
*  three different groups that they're going to get to nominate the secretary of state, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1012.72s)]
*  and of course like... [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1016.24s)]
*  Well, that's why the campaign would never want to do it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1017.1999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1018.96s)]
*  It's just you would... [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  Because they want to be as unspecific as possible. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1020.56s)]
*  I mean, Kamala Harris's entire campaign at its core was driven by the overarching [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1023.28s)]
*  objective of never committing to anything specific. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  Which turned out not to be an effective strategy. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1032.24s)]
*  Especially when someone just floats into the consciousness of the electorate four [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1035.2s)]
*  months before an election, does no campaigning, never gets any votes. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1040.8s)]
*  You can imagine a scenario in which like the same switch happens with the same amount of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1044.3999999999999s)]
*  time, but it's a person who's like diligent about like delineating what they like. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1048.96s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1054.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1055.12s)]
*  This is what's going to be different. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1055.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1057.12s)]
*  But any... [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1057.76s)]
*  Not saying ideologically, just someone with his level of self-possession and self-belief. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  Someone like, this is what I'm going to do. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  This is what I'm not going to do. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1064.16s)]
*  But like... [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1065.28s)]
*  She always seems so petrified. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1065.68s)]
*  And this is true for... [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1067.76s)]
*  For most Democrats, I think. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1068.96s)]
*  And you're as attorney general. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1070.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1071.28s)]
*  If you look at the difference between Donald Trump and the people like Donald Trump in his [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  movement, who are very aggressive and almost shameless. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1077.2s)]
*  They don't care if they get wildly attacked by all these taboos and conventional wisdom [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1083.0400000000002s)]
*  of media institutions. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1088.48s)]
*  Trump realized it doesn't matter what he won in 2016. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1090.0800000000002s)]
*  He never cared. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1092.72s)]
*  He's just not in his character. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1093.68s)]
*  And that brought in this new ethos that, for better or worse, in terms of the positions, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  that's how, and I think Dave was making this point quite importantly and effectively, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1102.16s)]
*  that the biggest benefit of Trump is that he has broken so many long-standing institutions [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1106.0800000000002s)]
*  beginning with the corporate media. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1112.64s)]
*  They just got exposed as having no relevance, no connection to what people were thinking. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1113.8400000000001s)]
*  It was a paper tiger all along. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1119.1200000000001s)]
*  Paper tiger all along. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1120.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1122.0s)]
*  But Democrats are such institutionalists... [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1122.4s)]
*  They're afraid of the paper tiger. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1124.64s)]
*  That's their bread and butter. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1126.48s)]
*  That's where they live. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1128.72s)]
*  They need praise from the New York Times. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1129.52s)]
*  They want the tiger not to be made out of paper. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1131.68s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1134.0s)]
*  They want the tiger. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1134.72s)]
*  Also, these are the institutions that matter on their circles. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1135.68s)]
*  You need praise from CNN. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1138.8000000000002s)]
*  If CNN criticized you or the New York Times editorially condemned you, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1140.5600000000002s)]
*  that would be shameful. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1145.2s)]
*  That's your friends. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1146.4s)]
*  They hate that. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1146.96s)]
*  Everybody would judge you. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1147.8400000000001s)]
*  There are Democrats who are more self-confident, have more self-belief. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  The problem with Kamala Harris is that the reason she just never felt comfortable in public [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1156.0s)]
*  is because she was a fraud all along when she became vice president. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1161.84s)]
*  There are certain things that she knows really well. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1166.96s)]
*  She's been a prosecutor her whole life. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1170.56s)]
*  She knows how to question witnesses in a Senate judiciary hearing. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1172.48s)]
*  Violent cops just skilled at that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1174.96s)]
*  She knows criminal justice. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1177.04s)]
*  That's what she knows. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1179.2s)]
*  Maybe that's about it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1180.48s)]
*  So when you're vice president, you have to pretend that you're a world leader. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1182.56s)]
*  She had no idea. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1187.12s)]
*  The fear was not that she would offend people and that she would get exposed. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1190.24s)]
*  Even whatever ideas she might have had, she had to put eight blockers in her brain so that she [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1194.0s)]
*  wouldn't even accidentally expose any of them. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1201.28s)]
*  Every time she was speaking, she was careful not to really say anything. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1204.3200000000002s)]
*  That's why she'd go these insane conceit sentences. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1208.4s)]
*  Because, oh my God, I'm about to say something. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  Then you have to create sub clauses and clauses about... [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  Or just be super ambiguous and refuse to answer. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1218.8s)]
*  I think that's like there was a lot of real energy behind her initial emergence because [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1220.8s)]
*  what polls were showing is that people just wanted something different than two [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1227.1200000000001s)]
*  old men who had both been president, Trump and Biden. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1230.64s)]
*  She had that opportunity. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1233.76s)]
*  She did very well in the debate. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1235.28s)]
*  She became a better speaker. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1237.52s)]
*  She had the opportunity to have people... [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1240.0s)]
*  She got past that, like, am I presidential enough? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1242.3200000000002s)]
*  Those tests. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1246.96s)]
*  I think people were... [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1248.8s)]
*  I think everybody was like, okay, she seems competent. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  Now the question is, who is she? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1255.44s)]
*  What does she believe? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1256.88s)]
*  What is her thing? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1257.6000000000001s)]
*  What is she going to do? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1258.88s)]
*  And that's the question they... [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1259.92s)]
*  So blatant. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1261.44s)]
*  A skilled politician can evade a question and not have you realize they're evading the question. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1262.56s)]
*  She would be so blatant. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1267.6799999999998s)]
*  They would say, were Americans better off four years ago or today? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1269.36s)]
*  That was the first question in the debate. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1272.72s)]
*  She's like, look, I grew up in a middle class. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1273.9199999999998s)]
*  And then it's just right away. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1276.3999999999999s)]
*  There's no cleanest to it. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1278.96s)]
*  There's no coolness to it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1281.44s)]
*  It's just so blunt, the evasion. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1282.72s)]
*  And people heard it so much and they're like, I have no idea who she is. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1285.36s)]
*  I just don't trust her. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1288.32s)]
*  Whereas Trump is very clear about what he wants to do. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1289.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1292.3200000000002s)]
*  I think... [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1292.64s)]
*  Also the fact that they were trying to run the resistance campaign again, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1295.44s)]
*  in which the whole idea was that they don't really need to fight what they're for [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1301.28s)]
*  because what they're against is enough. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1304.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1307.52s)]
*  I mean, they did that in 2016 and lost. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1307.92s)]
*  And I think they thought, because all their media outlets were constantly telling them... [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1310.72s)]
*  I don't know if you saw it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1316.48s)]
*  You guys may not have seen either, but there's a really good... [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  I've been waiting for this to happen. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1321.92s)]
*  They've done these before in prior elections, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  where they do the trajectory of the mood and demeanor of cable shows that are covering the election. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1325.6000000000001s)]
*  So there's one really good one with the Young Turks in 2016, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1334.5600000000002s)]
*  where they started off so certain Hillary was going to win. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1337.8400000000001s)]
*  And then as things go on, they're starting to get more doubts, more doubts. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1340.16s)]
*  And then they reach the point where they actually think she's not going to win. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1342.96s)]
*  And then they have to accept it. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1346.0s)]
*  And then they break down. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1347.1200000000001s)]
*  It's really funny to watch that trajectory. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1348.48s)]
*  Yeah, like a montage of the low lights. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1350.88s)]
*  So they did one with MSNBC. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1352.96s)]
*  And it's about a 30-minute clip, but it's incredibly entertaining, but also revealing. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1355.0400000000002s)]
*  The first, I would say 12 to 15 minutes. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1359.1200000000001s)]
*  So a little bit before the polls closed. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1362.48s)]
*  And then once the polls started closing, an hour and two hours into the night, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1364.3200000000002s)]
*  everything they were saying was designed to lead people to believe that Kamloops was winning, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1368.0800000000002s)]
*  that all the signs were really good. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1373.8400000000001s)]
*  There were huge lines in the colleges, the liberal colleges, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1375.8400000000001s)]
*  where huge numbers of young people turned out. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1379.52s)]
*  There were immense lines in urban areas. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1382.56s)]
*  All of this turned out to be totally false. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1386.16s)]
*  And a lot of the young people who voted at colleges voted for Trump. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1387.84s)]
*  But they were instilling their audience constantly [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1392.8799999999999s)]
*  because they believed there was no way that Trump could win. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1395.68s)]
*  Because in their world, even though we won in 2016 before people really understood him, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1398.0s)]
*  now January 6 has happened. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1403.76s)]
*  And that's the worst, darkest day in our history. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1405.52s)]
*  And Trump is a convicted felon. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1408.32s)]
*  And he's facing felony charges because he had these documents in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1411.2s)]
*  And they woke themselves up into such a lather, such a frenzy over this, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1416.0s)]
*  that they could not conceive that people didn't see things the same way. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1421.2s)]
*  And so even though the polls were showing that it was a close election, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1425.36s)]
*  everybody was saying it's a good close election, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1428.16s)]
*  intuitively they just did not believe it was possible for Trump to win [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1430.56s)]
*  because they did not believe it was possible that anybody other than a bunch of [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1434.32s)]
*  racist white men would dare to go vote for Trump. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1437.52s)]
*  To the point where even they were saying at the beginning, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  there were a bunch of them saying this, that this election is going to be [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1443.52s)]
*  the rising up of white women. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1446.4s)]
*  White women are going to finally realize that if they vote Republican, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1447.84s)]
*  they're trading away their own rights. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1452.24s)]
*  And instead of doing what their husbands tell them to do, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1454.24s)]
*  which was a big ad that they ran to encourage women to vote differently [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1456.8s)]
*  than their husband and hide it, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1461.6s)]
*  that women were finally going to rise up in sisterhood and empathize with black [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1463.3600000000001s)]
*  women and Latino women finally and vote for Kamala as a kind of solidarity [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1467.52s)]
*  movement of women. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1472.24s)]
*  And the idea that people think that way, the idea that that was going to happen [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1473.76s)]
*  turned out to be completely false. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1477.52s)]
*  They had to, they had no finger on the pulse of how people think because they're [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1478.64s)]
*  so cloistered. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1483.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's why their audience disappeared because they've been led to believe so [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1484.72s)]
*  many things over so many years. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1487.84s)]
*  Robert Mueller's going to frog mark Trump out of the White House. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1489.44s)]
*  None of it happens. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1492.96s)]
*  Is it people who are excited about the campaign events with Liz Cheney? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1493.84s)]
*  Who is this for? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1497.84s)]
*  It's for the five people who care about this stuff and watch the show. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1498.72s)]
*  Who go on their shows. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1501.84s)]
*  And nobody else. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1503.4399999999998s)]
*  Who thought that campaign would lose anyways? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1505.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1507.28s)]
*  Imagine how out of touch you have to be to think that Liz Cheney is a campaign asset. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1508.48s)]
*  Not just unassuming, the one to feature in the closing weeks of the campaign. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1512.8s)]
*  Like, look at Liz Cheney. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1516.72s)]
*  She also endorsing us amongst other things. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1517.52s)]
*  That would be one thing. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1521.6s)]
*  It was like the main feature. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1522.6399999999999s)]
*  Also, there were so many things. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1525.28s)]
*  They sent Obama to Philadelphia to speak to black men as though Obama, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1527.36s)]
*  who gets off his yacht, who gets off the yacht of Richard Branson [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1536.48s)]
*  out of his Martha Vineyard estate and he goes to Philadelphia. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1540.24s)]
*  So he understands what black men in Philadelphia, like working class black men, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1543.76s)]
*  are thinking and feeling as though he's a credible voice to speak to them or for them. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1546.7199999999998s)]
*  He just floats in in his expensive suit, tells them if you're reluctant to vote for Kamala, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1551.52s)]
*  it's obviously because you have deep-seated misogyny and you need to get over it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1557.28s)]
*  Then he gets back on his jet. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1559.92s)]
*  Or they send Bill Clinton to Michigan and they're like, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1561.84s)]
*  look, I know that you think that the war in Israel, the war in Gaza is wrong, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1564.32s)]
*  but you're totally wrong. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1567.36s)]
*  I'm going to tell you the real story about why Israel is right about everything. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1568.32s)]
*  They just track out these completely out of touch political elites and multimillionaires. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1571.44s)]
*  All the stuff with Oprah and Beyonce, Taylor Swift. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1576.56s)]
*  The idea that that was effective, they tried it all in 2016. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1580.56s)]
*  It couldn't, like I understand this being like one prong of your campaign, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  like among other things, you've got the celebrities. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1589.04s)]
*  Like it was the only thing that anyways, the election has been too long. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1591.28s)]
*  I've been out of the game for a while. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1595.1999999999998s)]
*  I just needed to get it all in my seat, but it was great. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1597.4399999999998s)]
*  Anyways, it almost seemed like they were trying to lose, but they weren't. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1599.4399999999998s)]
*  But if they were, that would be the campaign you would run. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1605.04s)]
*  They would have done very well. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1607.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1609.9199999999998s)]
*  The last question comes from Cocktoas. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1611.12s)]
*  Actually, I'm just going to, it's already on the screen, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1617.9199999999998s)]
*  but I'm going to rephrase it. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1620.08s)]
*  Okay, Glenn, to how you can read it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1621.28s)]
*  You can read it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1623.28s)]
*  You're going to have to swallow it. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1624.32s)]
*  How do you manage to have everything, Glenn? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1625.76s)]
*  No, you can read the question as it is. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1628.9599999999998s)]
*  Hey, Glenn, on a personal note, what does your daily routine look like? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1631.12s)]
*  How do you stay so productive and avoid procrastination and also keep yourself so handsome? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1634.32s)]
*  And fit and yeah. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1640.3200000000002s)]
*  It's funny because I don't think I'm so productive. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1643.28s)]
*  I do think I was more productive for a lot of different reasons. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1646.96s)]
*  I don't prioritize work and productivity as much as I did for a long time in my life, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1650.0s)]
*  for a lot of personal reasons. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1654.64s)]
*  Also, I have my kids that I'm raising myself, and that takes a lot of energy and attention. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1657.6000000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of nonprofits and the David and Miranda Institute that take up a lot of my time [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1663.2s)]
*  as well. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1667.6s)]
*  Sometimes I get angry that I haven't written a book since 2021 or that I don't write enough [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1669.52s)]
*  columns for Folio, which is the largest newspaper in Brazil with which I'm a columnist where I can [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1673.52s)]
*  just write a column whenever I want. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1677.84s)]
*  I don't write as many articles as I wish I could, so I sometimes don't feel like I am productive. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1679.76s)]
*  Why am I not as productive as I've been? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1684.8s)]
*  But obviously doing a show essentially five nights a week and having to do a bunch of other [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1687.04s)]
*  adjacent responsibilities like going on other shows and traveling and sometimes writing. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1692.4s)]
*  It does consume a lot of energy. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1700.16s)]
*  This show, people warned me, like Tucker warned me, Laura Ingraham warned me. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1701.6000000000001s)]
*  If you're going to do a five night a week show, you better be prepared to realize that it's going [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1707.2800000000002s)]
*  to consume all of your time and energy. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1711.3600000000001s)]
*  I was like, ah, that's true for that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1712.72s)]
*  That's not true for me. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1714.16s)]
*  Other people, they're not me. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1715.0400000000002s)]
*  What I try and do is given that we go late, and by the time we get home, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1718.72s)]
*  it's midnight because we're two hours ahead of the East Coast right now. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1721.52s)]
*  Usually we're ahead an hour. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  I try and sleep a little bit late and then not awaken and get up and running with work. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1726.48s)]
*  I try and give myself a few hours of relaxed time, slow time, exercise, play tennis, or go to the gym [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1734.24s)]
*  just to not have my work day start at 9 a.m. and then not be done until 11 or 12 at midnight. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1743.44s)]
*  You have to work to create that buffer. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1751.1999999999998s)]
*  I also think when reading the news is part of your work, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1753.4399999999998s)]
*  and reading the news is always coming at you, now it's very hard to switch off sometimes. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1758.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the kind of classical standard activity for the United States and the suburbs in the morning [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1767.1999999999998s)]
*  is you would wake up and get your newspaper and read it before work. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1776.32s)]
*  My biggest boomer thing is that I wake up in the morning and I read the paper. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1778.64s)]
*  You get the print edition. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1782.16s)]
*  No, I read the print edition on my tablet. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1783.1200000000001s)]
*  Not the website. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1787.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, I go through the pages of the print edition. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1788.96s)]
*  Because I do think actually you'll notice if you go through a newspaper in its actual form, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1791.68s)]
*  you'll end up reading a lot of articles because they're in front of you that you [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1796.48s)]
*  wouldn't choose to click on. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1799.44s)]
*  And it also gives like sometimes when it's just a bunch of links, like it has no content. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1800.72s)]
*  You have a sense of like hierarchy and like someone thought about like what is the most [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1806.32s)]
*  important thing instead of just like anyways. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1811.84s)]
*  Right, you find things in the middle that are really long that have a headline that you would [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1814.6399999999999s)]
*  never have clicked on but then you read it and you're glad you did. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1817.6799999999998s)]
*  And obviously as you were saying, when your work is related to the news, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1820.24s)]
*  even just reading the newspaper already gets your brain going about. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1825.04s)]
*  I wake up in the morning and I'm sitting at my breakfast table drinking coffee and reading the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1827.84s)]
*  news like am I working? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1832.3999999999999s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1834.32s)]
*  But like I said, I think it's important to make sure that you just purposely structure [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  that first part of your day given how long you're going to go at night where you're not [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1841.12s)]
*  working. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1845.2s)]
*  And I like to do a lot more to reserve weekends. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1845.92s)]
*  I'm much more careful about and resolute about taking real vacations, which for 10 years I [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1848.96s)]
*  never did. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1854.6399999999999s)]
*  So I just try and like have a more balanced sense of priority. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1856.48s)]
*  I also think the fact that I worked with you before you started doing the show and I kind [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1860.08s)]
*  of like saw how you worked then. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1865.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think it was hard for all of us, I think, doing the show and the fact like having solid, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1867.12s)]
*  ironclad commitment every night, whereas before the time things were a lot looser. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1874.0s)]
*  Yeah, like we published when we wanted to publish. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1881.6799999999998s)]
*  You did start with me like at the start of like just a little bit before the insane intense. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1884.8s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1890.8s)]
*  Brazil reporting that freed Lula and that was we there was no balance at all. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1891.84s)]
*  We were every day, day and night. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1896.3999999999999s)]
*  And the image of like reading the news in the morning and know where I'd be working, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1898.3999999999999s)]
*  that was like, oh yeah, because it was super. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1902.48s)]
*  They were talking about us. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1905.52s)]
*  It was exactly. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1906.72s)]
*  Yeah, no, those kinds of things. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1908.24s)]
*  And that went on for a year. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1909.9199999999998s)]
*  So it was very hard to gather this one of having to be here at this time. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1911.44s)]
*  But it's good because now for the first time, I think in your life, mine in a few years, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1914.88s)]
*  but I imagine the first time of your life, you have this time that you've got to be working. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1921.3600000000001s)]
*  But the corollary of that, that you have a time that you're not working. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1926.56s)]
*  Like in the morning, you're not. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1929.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1931.28s)]
*  It gives you more of a structure. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1931.52s)]
*  And in some way that can be imprisoning, but in other ways it can be liberating. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1933.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1936.48s)]
*  And also, you know, you come to the studio, you don't work from home anymore. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1937.04s)]
*  So I guess when you're home, you're not at work. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1940.48s)]
*  Right, you have some separation as well. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1942.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1944.88s)]
*  Look, at the end of the day, if your quote unquote work is coming into a studio, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1945.52s)]
*  preparing a program, talking about things that you're interested in, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1951.04s)]
*  you probably shouldn't be complaining. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1955.84s)]
*  But since the question was raised, you know, which was like, how do you do your day to be [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1957.92s)]
*  so productive? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1963.2s)]
*  And I was saying like, sometimes it's hard to be as productive as I wish I could be. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1963.76s)]
*  I was answering this for that reason. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1966.96s)]
*  But, you know, this is work, but it's the kind of work that even if we weren't [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1968.0s)]
*  be doing it for work, we'd probably still be doing it anyway. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1971.92s)]
*  So that's a huge... [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1974.08s)]
*  Yeah, you'd be reading the news, you'd want to talk about it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1975.04s)]
*  You know, one of the major reasons I started writing was because I just had things I had [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1977.68s)]
*  to get out. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1980.8s)]
*  And I just wanted a platform to be heard, to be able to talk about them and be heard. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1982.64s)]
*  So very little actionable advice, I'm afraid. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1986.48s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even... [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1989.52s)]
*  I thought I'd get good advice about the morning. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1990.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that is true. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1992.32s)]
*  Just not to wake up and just go running. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1993.76s)]
*  Like give yourself like a time to just... [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1995.84s)]
*  Or if you work in the morning, you wake up, go to work, but have the time at night to [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=1997.68s)]
*  online. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2002.88s)]
*  Right, yeah, totally. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2003.3600000000001s)]
*  Have a time where you're not working. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2003.92s)]
*  Totally. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2004.96s)]
*  That's important. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2005.28s)]
*  All right, that's a good note to end. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2005.92s)]
*  The dogs are always working. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2007.68s)]
*  They're all very calm, though they're on the floor. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2008.88s)]
*  So as always, we want to thank you so much for making this show possible. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2012.0800000000002s)]
*  Can you just read the comment that Koeman was walking around with a full uncapped water [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2016.96s)]
*  bottle. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2020.72s)]
*  Oh, and making a lot of noise with it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2021.2s)]
*  It's got no lid, it's full of water. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2022.96s)]
*  And he didn't spill it? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2025.04s)]
*  He didn't spill anything, no. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2026.24s)]
*  He's very elegant, very careful. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2028.24s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2029.68s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2030.08s)]
*  How he carries it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2030.48s)]
*  So responsible. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2031.52s)]
*  We're just playing with fire now. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2032.08s)]
*  All right, so thank you guys so much for being members here, for participating in the program. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2033.76s)]
*  It really means a lot to us in every way. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2038.48s)]
*  And I wasn't here on Tuesday because I did Tucker's show. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2041.36s)]
*  So for those who haven't watched it, I recommend it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2046.08s)]
*  I think it ended up just the way Tucker and I speak. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2048.96s)]
*  Even outside of cameras, we speak that way. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2052.32s)]
*  Just some guys show, some independent show you might have heard of. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2053.6s)]
*  Tucker Carlson show, yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2056.24s)]
*  Interestingly, it sometimes supplants Joe Rogan's show as the most watched or listened to podcast. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2058.24s)]
*  And then it has multiple platforms where it appears, like Twitter and YouTube. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2064.56s)]
*  And so it's very, very consequential in terms of its impact and reach. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2068.64s)]
*  I think it's more, I think Joe Rogan's number, I don't claim any special [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2072.56s)]
*  insight into his numbers, it's just my impressions. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2076.8799999999997s)]
*  It fluctuates a lot with the guest. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2080.24s)]
*  He has a pretty loyal audience no matter who the guest is, but obviously some guests attract more. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2083.12s)]
*  But Tucker's, I mean, Tucker's the same thing. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2088.4s)]
*  Tucker has a very, just because people watched him every night on Fox. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2090.8s)]
*  And a lot of people only watched him on Fox because they understood that he was doing [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2094.96s)]
*  something heterodox and different and a little bit more substantive than the common Fox fare. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2100.56s)]
*  And so those people left with Tucker and his following is very loyal and huge. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2105.68s)]
*  As well globally. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2112.3199999999997s)]
*  So the opportunity to just be able to provide like free flowing analysis for two hours or so [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2114.24s)]
*  on the topics I care about most is definitely one that I value. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2119.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2124.4799999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLP4TRzWzM&t=2124.8799999999997s)]
