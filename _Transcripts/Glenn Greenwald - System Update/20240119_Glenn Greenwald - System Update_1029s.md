# How the Israel Lobby Takes Out Its Opponents
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo)
*  All right, so we wanted to spend some time last night talking to you about the career [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=0.0s)]
*  of Paul Finley, who served as a member of Congress from 1960 until 1982, a Republican [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=11.92s)]
*  congressman from Illinois. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=18.48s)]
*  We didn't have time, so we want to do that tonight because it is a career that is really [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=19.48s)]
*  fascinating and I think very revealing of our current political dynamic. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  A lot of times, a lot of this history that's very recent history, I mean 1960 to 1982 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=27.84s)]
*  is not that long ago. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=31.88s)]
*  People forget about, I had forgotten about his career, I had known about it at some point, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=33.96s)]
*  but it is important to remember because so much of what we're going through now, so much [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=38.56s)]
*  of what we debate now is reflected in the history very recently because not that much [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=43.32s)]
*  is different. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  And one of the things that makes him so timely and so relevant to the news cycle is that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  he was the author of the War Powers Act, the law, the much discussed law last week that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  governs when a president can deploy military force in an emergency without Congress and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=59.08s)]
*  that was being discussed because a lot of people were trying to justify Biden's bombing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=65.36s)]
*  of Yemen as a defensive act that he doesn't need Congress to do because the Houthis in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=69.06s)]
*  Yemen were attacking American ships and as we walked through the last time, that was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=75.64s)]
*  not a justification, even if it's a moral justification for the war, it's not a legal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=80.38s)]
*  one for Biden to do without Congress because it wasn't a defensive act. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't Biden in that moment defending American ships. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  He had threatened to do this for weeks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  They had planned this attack for weeks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  And the problem is, as we discussed, that if you do it without congressional approval, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  congressional debate or public buy-in, it can just go on and on and on with no end. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  And just this week, we've now seen them bombing Yemen again and again and will likely continue [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=102.48s)]
*  to do it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=106.72s)]
*  And this was the reason why Paul Finley authored the War Powers Act. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  He did it in response to the way in which the United States has kind of fell into the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=111.4s)]
*  war in Vietnam. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=115.32s)]
*  There was that 1964 Senate resolution authorizing force when the CIA lied to the public and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=117.52s)]
*  to the Congress about the Gulf of Tonkin incident where they said that the North Vietnamese [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=122.56s)]
*  had been aggressive and attacked U.S. ships and it came out several decades later that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=126.96s)]
*  the United States security state lied, that the aggressors were the United States trying [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=131.68s)]
*  to create a cause to justify getting the Senate to approve the escalation that we're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=136.14s)]
*  under President Johnson. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=141.1s)]
*  But before that, there were years where under President Kennedy, advisors were being sent, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=144.33999999999997s)]
*  advisors were being killed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=149.33999999999997s)]
*  Kennedy said that the reason he wanted to remove troops or all people out of Vietnam [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  before he was killed was because he was seeing how many advisors were being killed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=156.61999999999998s)]
*  He didn't know that that was kept from him. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=161.94s)]
*  And here is Paul Finley along with a Democratic member of Congress who was an ally of his, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=164.94s)]
*  Don Frazier, writing in the LA Times in September of 2008 about the battle over war powers, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=169.18s)]
*  which remember was a very robust debate during the Bush years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=175.58s)]
*  That was one of the things that caused me to get involved in politics was this debate [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=179.74s)]
*  over the limits of presidential power. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=183.06s)]
*  And here's what they wrote, quote, the framers of the Constitution agreed that the president [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=185.66s)]
*  could be commander in chief of land and naval forces, but deeply concerned over the gravity [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=189.54s)]
*  of war and as a safeguard against hasty and needless hostilities with foreign countries, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  they agreed that Congress should have the prerogative to quote, declare or authorize [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=200.5s)]
*  war. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=204.7s)]
*  The framers meant to prohibit the president from waging war without a declaration of war [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=206.18s)]
*  or specific authorization by Congress, except when necessary to repel attacks on American [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=209.54s)]
*  territory or commerce, its military or citizens. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=214.66s)]
*  In recent history, an unauthorized presidential war brought calamity to the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=219.38s)]
*  Ambiguity in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964 was used as a pretext for executive [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=224.58s)]
*  war making in Vietnam not intended by Congress. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=230.02s)]
*  That war was unjustifiable from a military and geopolitical standpoint. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  The resolution retroactively approved the retaliation by President Johnson for an attack [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=237.78s)]
*  on Navy shifts in the Gulf of Tonkin and it warned North Vietnam and all interested parties [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=242.66s)]
*  of US readiness to engage in further military operations through the Southeast Asia Treaty [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=246.66s)]
*  Organization. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=251.82s)]
*  But it contained no language that actually authorized the president to order acts of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=253.62s)]
*  war in the future. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=257.46s)]
*  Johnson nevertheless used it to increase the US commitment in Vietnam to half a million [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=259.38s)]
*  men. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=263.3s)]
*  As domestic opposition to the war increased and US forces began to withdraw, Congress [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=264.9s)]
*  passed the War Powers Act of 1973. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=269.06s)]
*  We were members of the House Committee that helped frame this resolution and were engaged [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=271.7s)]
*  in the process until it was passed over the veto of President Nixon. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=275.38s)]
*  It is a necessary and proper law that forbids a president from waging war without authority [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=279.38s)]
*  from Congress except to repel attack. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=283.58s)]
*  Now at the time, this congressman, Paul Finley, was working at an organization because he [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=288.1s)]
*  had been removed from Congress in 1982 when the pro-Israel lobby in the United States [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  targeted him by recruiting a challenger against him and then financing him lavishly, the challenger, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=301.9s)]
*  to remove Paul Finley from Congress because Paul Finley was not only an opponent of American [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  intervention but also an opponent of American support for Israel at a time when they were [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=311.9s)]
*  trying to make it, the pro-Israel lobby was taboo, career destroying, for any member of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=316.06s)]
*  either party to oppose the financing by the United States of Israel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  In 2005, while he was still at the New Yorker, Jeffrey Goldberg, who is now the editor-in-chief [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  of the Atlantic, who had used his position at the New Yorker to lie the country into [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=334.58s)]
*  the war in Iraq, wrote an article called The Real Insiders that purported to explain why [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  and how Paul Finley was removed from Congress. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=344.17999999999995s)]
*  This was a year before Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer published their book The Israel [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  Lobby, which described the massive amount of power that the pro-Israel lobby in the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=353.54s)]
*  United States had amassed and their ability to demand and coerce and pressure and intimidate [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=358.74s)]
*  members of Congress to keep sending money to Israel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=364.1s)]
*  And Walt and Mearsheimer were accused of being anti-Semitic for writing that book, even though [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  it was very scholarly about the power of the pro-Israel lobby. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=370.82000000000005s)]
*  As they said, there was nothing illegal about that lobby. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=375.38s)]
*  There's a lot of other lobbies like it, like the Big Pharma lobby, the Wall Street lobby, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  Planned Parenthood, the NRA, it's just this lobby involves the interests of a foreign [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=381.46s)]
*  country and that's what makes it so unique. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=386.02s)]
*  And here was Jeffrey Goldberg in July of 2005 while still at the New Yorker just off helping [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=389.14s)]
*  sell the country by lying about Saddam Hussein into the war in Iraq before he went to the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=393.78s)]
*  Atlantic explaining what happened to Paul Finley. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=398.82s)]
*  Quote, A-PAC, Asher explained, is loyal to its friends and merciless to its enemies. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  In 1982, Asher led a campaign to defeat Paul Finley, a Republican congressman from Springfield, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  Illinois, who once referred to himself as Yasser Arafat's best friend in Congress and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=413.38s)]
*  who later compared Arafat to Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  Quote, there was a real desire to help Finley out of Congress, Asher said. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=421.7s)]
*  He was an A-PAC official, Asher. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=426.26s)]
*  He identified an obscure Democratic lawyer in Springfield, Richard Durbin, as somebody [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=427.9s)]
*  who could defeat Finley. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=432.58s)]
*  Quote, we met at my apartment in Chicago and I recruited him to run for Congress, he recalled. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=433.58s)]
*  I probed his views and I explained things that I had learned mostly from A-PAC. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=438.1s)]
*  I wanted to make sure we were supporting someone who was not only against Paul Finley but also [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=442.02s)]
*  a friend of Israel. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=446.42s)]
*  Do you see they were removing members of Congress and replacing them based on one factor, who [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=449.62s)]
*  is friendly to Israel, this foreign country? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=454.82s)]
*  Asher went on, and there's Jeffrey Goldberg telling this story, not John Mearsheimer and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=458.1s)]
*  Stephen Wall. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=462.42s)]
*  Quote, Asher went on. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=463.06s)]
*  Quote, he beat Finley with a lot of help from Jews, in state and out of state. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=464.41999999999996s)]
*  Now, him, did the Jewish money find him? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=469.38s)]
*  I traveled around the country talking about how he had the opportunity to defeat someone [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=471.38s)]
*  unfriendly to Israel and the gates opened. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=474.9s)]
*  Durbin, who went on to win the Senate seat, is now the Democratic whip. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=478.58s)]
*  He is a fierce critic of Bush's Iraq policy but like A-PAC generally supports the administration's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=482.65999999999997s)]
*  approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=487.38s)]
*  Durbin said that he considers Asher to be, quote, his most loyal friend in the Jewish [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=490.34s)]
*  community. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=494.34s)]
*  Now, the reason that's so revealing is when John Mearsheimer and Stephen Wall wrote a book [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=496.97999999999996s)]
*  explaining how this lobby works the next year, they almost had their careers destroyed because [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=501.94s)]
*  they were widely accused of being anti-Semitic. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=507.21999999999997s)]
*  Here was Jeffrey Goldberg turning this guy into a hero by saying he was right to cleanse [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=509.21999999999997s)]
*  and purge the American Congress of anybody critical of Israel. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=515.62s)]
*  As after he was removed, he formed this Council for the National Interest where he advocated the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=518.8199999999999s)]
*  kind of anti-interventionist views that I just read you from the LA Times trying to put limits [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=524.26s)]
*  on the president's power to bring the country to war and the ADL boasted to the fact that they [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=528.7399999999999s)]
*  were now targeting this organization. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=534.18s)]
*  Here's from the ADL on October 3rd, 2008, its quote, backgrounder. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=536.5s)]
*  The Council for the National Interest, CNI, the Council for the National Interest, which includes [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=541.4599999999999s)]
*  the Council for the National Interest Foundation is an anti-Israel organization which is opposed [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=546.82s)]
*  to USAID to Israel and disseminates demonizing propaganda about Israel to academics, politicians, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=552.5s)]
*  and other audiences. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=558.34s)]
*  CNI founders Paul Finley and Pete McCloskey are the founders of CNIF and the president of both [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=560.26s)]
*  entities is Eugene Bird. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=565.78s)]
*  On August 2008, the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Denver, CNI ran an ad in [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=568.5s)]
*  the Denver Post highlighting high foreclosure rates in the US and charging their quote, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=573.62s)]
*  meanwhile, billions of your tax dollars continue to purchase beautiful homes with subsidized [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=578.1s)]
*  mortgages into Israel. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=583.62s)]
*  Now that's absolutely true. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=586.26s)]
*  This is the point we've been making for a long time is that millions of Americans [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  have a lower standard of living than millions of Israelis even as the United States transfers [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=592.9s)]
*  millions, billions of dollars over to Israel. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=597.86s)]
*  Now you may support that, you may not support it, but certainly it's something the American [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=600.18s)]
*  citizenry should know and the group that was led by Paul Finley took out an ad [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=604.5s)]
*  making Americans aware of that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=610.26s)]
*  The ADL said quote, insinuating that US taxpayer dollars are helping Israelis afford their homes [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=611.54s)]
*  even while Americans cannot. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=618.42s)]
*  The ad called for quote, a big change in US policy toward Israel and her neighbors. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=620.66s)]
*  CNI ran a similar ad in the Christian Science Monitor the same day. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  CNI has run inflammatory anti-Israel ads in major national newspapers since 2002. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=628.9s)]
*  On 2007, CNI published an ad in the New York Times in support of an anti-Israel rally [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=635.54s)]
*  held that same day in Washington. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=640.26s)]
*  The ad demanded quote, end the Israeli occupation now. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=641.86s)]
*  In a widely circulated 2003 article liberating America from Israel, Paul Finley, a member of [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=645.3s)]
*  CNI's board of directors blamed America's relationship with Israel for the 9-11 terrorist [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=650.66s)]
*  attacks. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=654.74s)]
*  9-11 would not have occurred Finley wrote if the US government had refused to help Israel [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=656.04s)]
*  humiliate and destroy Palestinian society. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=660.28s)]
*  He continued quote, America has suffered 9-11 and its aftermath and may soon be at war with [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=663.8s)]
*  Iraq mainly because US policy in the Middle East is made in Israel not in Washington. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=668.28s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that is now more frequently said but back then was barely ever said. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=675.72s)]
*  Paul Finley paid for his career with it and we just want to kind of show you a [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=680.36s)]
*  video clip of him because he was such an interesting voice given that he was the author [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=684.84s)]
*  of the War Powers Act which now governs and tries to put limits on the ability of the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  United States to go to war. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=693.08s)]
*  He was trying to tell the truth about Israel just to say that obviously we're sending enormous [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=694.84s)]
*  amounts of money to that country and we're paying a big price for our support of that country, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=698.84s)]
*  not just financially but in terms of our security. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=703.4s)]
*  Here's Paul Finley speaking in 2007. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=705.24s)]
*  He's now deceased. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  He lived to be 98 and here he is giving his speech on this topic. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=708.84s)]
*  Paul Finley speaking in 2007. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=714.84s)]
*  Even sales of spare parts for pumps, for old pumps, are rigorously controlled. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=716.12s)]
*  As an American, I hang my head in shame to recount this fact because I know that America [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=724.9200000000001s)]
*  is the pipeline without which Israel could not survive and could not inflict this punishment [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=733.96s)]
*  upon those poor people in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=741.0s)]
*  Israel Shahak says torture of Palestinians comes in many forms. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=746.44s)]
*  Listen again to the words of Israel Shahak. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=753.64s)]
*  Torture by humiliation. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=757.16s)]
*  Palestinians, including the elderly, he writes, are frequently ordered to attend the office [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=761.24s)]
*  of the military governor for hours and even days. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=768.04s)]
*  They are required to stand all that time, patiently and quietly. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  Even the elderly must politely ask permission of a young Israeli official [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=779.7199999999999s)]
*  in order to have the right to go to the toilet. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=787.4s)]
*  The aim is to reduce all Palestinians without distinction. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=792.12s)]
*  Here I am reading again from Israel Shahak. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=796.2s)]
*  The aim is to reduce all Palestinians without distinction to the level of small children [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=801.0s)]
*  completely dependent upon higher authority and to put every Israeli on the higher level. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=808.2s)]
*  It is also legal, he continues to write, to close all clinics, all medical services in a town, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=815.6400000000001s)]
*  to cut off electricity for hours and days, to cut off telephone service for hours and days. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=824.44s)]
*  As an American, I hang my head in shame to have to recount these facts to you [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=832.84s)]
*  because I know that the U.S. government is the lifeline to Israel without which Israel could not [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=839.96s)]
*  inflict these dreadful policies upon these people. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=848.2s)]
*  And in today's... [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=852.84s)]
*  It is a very interesting fact that this is a moderate Republican who came out of the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=854.28s)]
*  Congress in the 1960s very much shaped by the war in Vietnam, by the fact that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=859.16s)]
*  after during at the height of the Cold War the U.S. began increasing this massive security state [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=865.88s)]
*  that operated in the dark that engineered coups in all other kinds of countries and he applied [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=870.28s)]
*  that same rationale consistently and equally to U.S. support for Israel. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=875.16s)]
*  He did not have an Israel exception to his worldview and for that he was destroyed, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=880.5200000000001s)]
*  he was removed from Congress, branded all anti-Semite. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  And we tried showing you through the videos we've shown you many times of Ron Paul and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=888.0400000000001s)]
*  Pappy Cannon offering a lot of these same critiques. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=891.6400000000001s)]
*  Pappy Cannon, a top official on the Nixon, Reagan, and Bush 41 White House, and then ran for president [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=894.36s)]
*  on these principles and got a lot of support as did Ron Paul, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=900.6s)]
*  who was on our show a few weeks ago talking about a lot of this. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=905.32s)]
*  There is a strain in Republican politics for a long time questioning why is the U.S. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  enduring so much damage and harm to fund the government of Israel but the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=913.24s)]
*  intent of AIPAC as Jeffrey Goldberg himself documented in that 2005 New York article was [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=920.6s)]
*  to send the signal that anybody who does that will be destroyed. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=925.72s)]
*  And we had Congressman Thomas Massie on our show who is one of the most principled, smartest [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=929.96s)]
*  members of the U.S. Congress who is very popular among the populist right but who is a dissenter [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=935.0s)]
*  on the issue of U.S. funding of Israel. He does not believe the U.S. government should be funding [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=940.6800000000001s)]
*  Israel nor does he believe that we should be giving up our free speech rights in the name [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=944.36s)]
*  of protecting that foreign country. And here he is in 2024, 40 years after Paul Finley was [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=948.0400000000001s)]
*  successfully removed from Congress by AIPAC, where AIPAC is troving through Kentucky trying [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=955.72s)]
*  to find a primary challenger to run against Thomas Massie. There's no way a Democrat could [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=961.16s)]
*  win that district. They need to remove him in a Republican primary based solely on, as they said, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=966.28s)]
*  the question of who is friendly to Israel. It is a very unhealthy environment that we have this [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=971.56s)]
*  major policy and anybody who asks questions about it or who in any way expresses any dissent, let [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=978.12s)]
*  alone tries to stimulate the debate on it in Congress where all of these things should be aired, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=985.4s)]
*  knows that there is a very powerful pro-Israel lobby in this country that will set out to [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=990.84s)]
*  destroy them, remove them from Congress, destroy their political career, and in more cases than not [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnjzh_qTKo&t=995.08s)]
