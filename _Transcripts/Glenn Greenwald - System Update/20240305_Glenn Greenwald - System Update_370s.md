# WATCH: Media Freaks Over SCOTUS Ballot Ruling
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M)
*  Now here is just a kind of supercut that was compiled by the site the media watchdog site [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=0.0s)]
*  News Busters that just has some completely unhinged comments from the liberal cable outlets, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=14.26s)]
*  journalists, activists, politicians, and just in a level of kind of desperation that is difficult [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=23.88s)]
*  to measure. Remember these people have spent weeks now ingesting very scary polls showing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=32.16s)]
*  Trump in the lead and their only hope is either that Trump gets convicted and in prison before [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=36.36s)]
*  the election and that's why they're so upset that the Supreme Court has decided to undertake [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=43.28s)]
*  the question of whether Trump has immunity because it may delay the trial and not allow them to have [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=47.76s)]
*  the trial before the election. They don't even make any bones about the fact that there's a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  legal issue. They want this trial before the election and that's why they're extra horrified [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  about the mess that the prosecutor at Atlanta Fannie Willis has made of that case because [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  arguably that was their strongest case. That the things he did in Georgia were proper, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=68.32s)]
*  they're gonna get an Atlanta jury for it, and then it turns out she is having a sexual [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=73.92s)]
*  affair with the prosecutor she chose who's getting hundreds of thousands of dollars from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=80.28s)]
*  the state while she's dating him that's redounding to her benefit. I mean the credibility of that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  case is destroyed whether she's disqualified or not and it's all on hold as well. All of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=90.32s)]
*  their tactics are running out. You have leftist and Muslim voters insisting they will not vote [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=96.72s)]
*  for Trump for Biden under any circumstances because of their anger over his support for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=105.4s)]
*  Israel in the war in Gaza and they were hoping the courts would save them and here's what they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=109.52s)]
*  were doing and saying today when they're realizing that at least on this case hope they won't. We've [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=114.56s)]
*  learned that it was a nine-to-nothing decision ruling that Donald Trump can be on the ballot [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=118.72s)]
*  in Colorado and other states. I'm not confident that that will produce a result that's good for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=123.44s)]
*  American democracy. This is actually what I had been concerned about. I had been concerned that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=130.44s)]
*  it shouldn't go to the Supreme Court. They would rule this way. I'd laugh if it weren't so sad. My [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=134.8s)]
*  next guest says Donald Trump is still an oath-breaking insurrectionist. Do you have confidence in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=140.64s)]
*  Supreme Court? Do you think this court is partisan? The court itself may have overstepped. The court [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=144.96s)]
*  went way further than it needed to go. Our colleague Melissa Murray has called this Supreme Court [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=149.96s)]
*  the YOLO Court. The criticism of the court is that they're playing interference. Not since Bush v. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  Gore have we seen a court that's had this many opportunities to interfere in the election. The [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  headline here is this that this is a... Not since Bush versus Gore have we seen a court with the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=166.44s)]
*  opportunities to interfere in the election. They're angry because the courts have not interfered in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=173.88s)]
*  the election. They're the ones who want the court to interfere in the election. They're the ones who [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=179.48s)]
*  want the court to ban Trump from the ballot. The court has repeatedly refused to intervene even [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=184.04s)]
*  when Trump was trying to remain in power for all the accusations that Amy Coney Barrett was there [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  to keep Trump in office. The Supreme Court repeatedly refused to intervene in that conflict, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=196.04s)]
*  letting all the lower court's rulings against Trump stand. Now they're refusing to intervene [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=201.0s)]
*  in the election by banning Trump from the ballot and they're casting this as the Supreme Court [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=207.08s)]
*  interfering in the election. Unanimous ruling but if you scratch the surface just a little... This [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=210.68s)]
*  is a five to four ruling. I'm part of it. This is actually a five to four decision. It's five to four. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=217.56s)]
*  Trump will take this, spin it, spread the misinformation, disinformation on it, so it's a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=224.28s)]
*  win for them. He's on the ballot and voters will vote and he looks like he's headed to become the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=229.24s)]
*  Republican nominee for president. You can't save a people from themselves. If they're determined to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=235.0s)]
*  re-elect him after he organized that insurrection, then there's nothing to stop the people from doing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=241.08s)]
*  that. At the end of the day, that's all they're left with. All they're left with is, look, we spent [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=247.16s)]
*  eight years calling Trump every name in the book. A fascist, a racist, a right nationalist, a dictator [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=253.08s)]
*  and we're now doing everything we can to prevent Americans from voting for him but it seems like [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=260.67999999999995s)]
*  we're losing. Ultimately, they're going to say that the reason they lost, they'll probably claim [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=267.23999999999995s)]
*  Russia interfered and they'll blame leftists for voting for a third party candidate or whatever. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=273.55999999999995s)]
*  That's always part of the script but what they're really going to have to do is what they're already [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  doing. You heard that there is, look, the American people are just stupid and they get what they [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=281.55999999999995s)]
*  deserve. We've told them who Trump is and they don't believe it because they're too dumb, they're [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=286.12s)]
*  too malicious, they don't trust us and all they're left with doing is heaping blame on American [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=293.16s)]
*  citizens for coming to the conclusion that these people are scumbags, that these institutions of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=299.8s)]
*  media are radically corrupted, that not only don't they deserve trust or faith, they deserve contempt [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=304.2s)]
*  and scorn and these people know this and they're watching their impotence and so all they're left [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=311.72s)]
*  to do is lash out at the American citizen for refusing to follow the lead of their superiors, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  these people, and instead they're furious that they're exercising their independent judgment [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  and all they're left to do is try and prevent Americans from doing that by putting Trump in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  prison and or removing them from the ballot and every time that tactic fails a little bit more, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=335.32000000000005s)]
*  they get more and more emotionally desperate. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=339.64s)]
*  you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMnrZaVi0M&t=369.64s)]
