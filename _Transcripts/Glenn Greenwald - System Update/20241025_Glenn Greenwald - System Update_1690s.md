# Dems' Failing "Trump Is Hitler" Tactic Deployed Again
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE)
*  It has been a long time Democratic Party tactic for as long as I can remember since I've been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=0.0s)]
*  paying attention to politics to compare their political opponents, their political enemies, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=11.88s)]
*  even the most generic and sort of unnotable Republicans, comparing them to fascists and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=16.92s)]
*  even Adolf Hitler. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=22.14s)]
*  In fact, after the war on terror really started to take off and the war in Iraq, the invasion [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=24.22s)]
*  of Iraq turned into a failure based on lies and things like Guantanamo and torture and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=30.34s)]
*  kidnappings and underground CIA dirty sites began emerging. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=35.66s)]
*  It was incredibly common for Democrats to call Dick Cheney and George Bush and those [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  who worked for him Nazis or to compare them to Hitler. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=47.58s)]
*  I would actually suggest that at the time you could make a case that there was a much [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=51.46s)]
*  more valid basis for comparing what George Bush and Dick Cheney were doing, things like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  unprovoked wars of aggression in Iraq to what defines Adolf Hitler than you could Donald Trump. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  Now I don't think the comparison between George Bush and Dick Cheney to Hitler is actually valid. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=70.5s)]
*  I'm saying you could make a more valid case for that than you could for comparing Trump [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=74.58s)]
*  to Hitler. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=79.5s)]
*  The idea that Trump is a fascist, that Trump is basically a new Hitler has been very prevalent [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=81.5s)]
*  in Democratic Party discourse since he became a viable candidate in 2015 and it's actually [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=87.86s)]
*  become even more intensified, more central to the Democratic Party messaging as the 2024 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=93.9s)]
*  election approaches. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=101.26s)]
*  It's amazing to watch this in part because it would be one thing if no one knew who Donald [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=102.26s)]
*  Trump was or what he intended to do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=107.78s)]
*  But everyone in the United States paying attention to politics remembers him being [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=109.78s)]
*  president just a few years ago and other than delusional MSNBC viewers or New Yorker readers, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=112.62s)]
*  nobody remembers the kinds of things that define Hitler and why we're supposed to regard [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=121.58s)]
*  him as a singular evil, things like concentration camps or genocide, little things like that, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  wars of aggression and conquest. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=133.66s)]
*  So trying to compare and insist that Donald Trump is some sort of protege of or intends [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=136.38s)]
*  to replicate what Hitler did when he was just president four years ago and didn't do any [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=142.18s)]
*  of the things that are now warning he's doing seems like a bizarre strategy, genuinely a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=147.54s)]
*  bizarre deranged unhinged strategy and yet it is clearly one of the tactics on which [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are most relying as we approach the election if not the central one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=160.9s)]
*  Here in the town hall, the CNN town hall that we were covering is Kamala Harris just obviously [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=164.86s)]
*  making a conscious choice to repeatedly label Donald Trump as a fascist. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=170.82s)]
*  Donald Trump at the lead. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=179.06s)]
*  You've quoted General Milley calling Donald Trump a fascist. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  You yourself have not used that word to describe him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=186.06s)]
*  Yes I do. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=189.18s)]
*  Yes I do. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=190.18s)]
*  And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=192.78s)]
*  Again look at their careers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=198.78s)]
*  These are not people with the exception I think of only Mike Pence. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  These were not politicians. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=205.82s)]
*  These are career people who have served in the highest roles in national security, who [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=208.28s)]
*  have served as generals in our military, who are highly respected. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=213.89999999999998s)]
*  I'm talking about the person who would be commander in chief, not to mention what we [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=219.58s)]
*  know and what they've told us about how he talks about the military. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=225.26000000000002s)]
*  Now is it any surprise that Donald Trump ran on a platform of undermining and weakening [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  the deep state, of abandoning bipartisan foreign policy consensus that has gone back decades [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=238.74s)]
*  on which these people's careers have depended, questioning the central orthodoxies of US [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=246.3s)]
*  foreign policy when it comes to things like NATO and constantly invading other countries [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=254.3s)]
*  and rebuilding them with wars and instead arguing that we should promote our resources [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=259.88s)]
*  and use our resources for the welfare of Americans instead? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=266.04s)]
*  Is it any wonder that those people have concluded that Donald Trump shouldn't be president? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=269.14s)]
*  For me, watching the military and intelligence community rebel against Trump and work with [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=273.5s)]
*  the Democrats to try and stop him is a testament to the value of Donald Trump, which is his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=279.62s)]
*  singular threat to status quo politics in the United States to disrupt and undermine [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=286.7s)]
*  it which is why all these people most invested in the orthodoxies of foreign policy like [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=294.42s)]
*  the Cheney family, Bill Kristol, all those neocons, these generals, the people in the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=299.98s)]
*  CIA are the ones who have worked most aggressively to sabotage Trump's campaign. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=304.38s)]
*  To me that's a positive. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=308.98s)]
*  I would not want to run for president touting Dick Cheney's endorsement. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=311.86s)]
*  Now obviously one of the people leading the way in trying to compare Trump to Hitler ironically [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  is Dick Cheney's daughter who was around and politically active, a big supporter of her [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=325.14s)]
*  father at the time when Democrats were using that attack about her father. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=332.34s)]
*  Here's what she tweeted on October 23rd, quote, if your response to General John Kelly, a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=337.54s)]
*  gold star father and Trump's White House chief of staff, confirming that Trump praised Hitler [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=344.02s)]
*  and called members of our military, quote, suckers and losers is to defend Trump, you [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=350.06s)]
*  need to look in the mirror and realize your dishonor will live forever. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=354.62s)]
*  Imagine being a Cheney and sanctimoniously lecturing the entire country, the 50% of the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=360.82s)]
*  country that supports Donald Trump as saying you will never get the stain of this dishonor [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=368.82s)]
*  off you no matter what. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=373.46s)]
*  And all the things that Cheney family has done and supported far as I said more aligned [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  with Adolf Hitler and what has defined him and his legacy than anything Donald Trump [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=381.18s)]
*  has done. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=386.18s)]
*  Now what's amazing about this is they're all treating this like this is kind of brand new [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=388.22s)]
*  breaking story. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=392.62s)]
*  And apparently General John Kelly was so disturbed by what President Trump said five years ago [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=396.14s)]
*  that he's waited this entire time to unveil this right before the election. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=404.3s)]
*  Here from NBC News, October 22nd, quote, former White House chief of staff John Kelly says [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=409.7s)]
*  Trump praised Hitler while in office. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=414.74s)]
*  Kelly, who was Trump's chief of staff from 2017 to 2019 said that the former president, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=417.02000000000004s)]
*  quote, falls into the general definition of fascist. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=422.1s)]
*  Quote, he commented more than once that you know that Hitler did some good things too, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=424.90000000000003s)]
*  Kelly said. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=430.7s)]
*  Certainly the former president is in the far right area. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=431.7s)]
*  He's certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=434.14s)]
*  He has said that so he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist for sure, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=437.7s)]
*  Kelly said. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=441.97999999999996s)]
*  By the way, do you notice how none of these people when they call Trump a fascist, when [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=442.97999999999996s)]
*  Kamala did it last night when he's doing it here, ever give a definition of any kind about [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=447.82s)]
*  what fascist even means and in what ways Trump is a fascist? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=452.88s)]
*  He admires dictators. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=460.02s)]
*  The entire foreign policy of the United States in the wake of World War II has been to hug [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=462.82s)]
*  and embrace and partner closely with the most savage dictators in the world, like the regime [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=467.26s)]
*  now in Saudi Arabia or in Egypt to overthrow democratically elected governments and impose [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=473.44s)]
*  dictatorial savage tyrannies on huge numbers of people around the world. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=481.46s)]
*  And they're going to pretend that Donald Trump is the one who admires dictators. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=486.66s)]
*  Here from the Atlantic on October 22nd, this is Jeffrey Goldberg, who is the person who [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=492.94s)]
*  based on anonymous sources claimed the last election that Trump called members of the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=500.22s)]
*  military losers and suckers, something that Trump vehemently denies for which there's [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=505.1s)]
*  never been any evidence. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=509.38s)]
*  Here is the article, quote, titled Trump, I need the kind of generals that Hitler had. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=511.54s)]
*  The Republicans' nominees preoccupation with dictators and his disdain for the American [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=518.1800000000001s)]
*  military is deepening. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=522.98s)]
*  Quote, former generals who have worked for Trump say that his sole military virtue he [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=524.58s)]
*  prizes is obedience. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=529.38s)]
*  Now let me just stop here and say that the model of American democracy actually is that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=533.22s)]
*  generals are supposed to obey the orders of the president of the United States. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=539.34s)]
*  That's what it means to have civilian control of the military. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=544.86s)]
*  Military doesn't operate on its own, isn't free to do what it wants. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=548.94s)]
*  It works under the authority, the command of the elected president who's a civilian. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=552.82s)]
*  That's why he's called the commander in chief of the military. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=558.0200000000001s)]
*  Generals are required to carry out his orders. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=562.1400000000001s)]
*  So often during the Trump presidency, the media celebrated generals like General Mattis [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=566.32s)]
*  and General Kelly and others for thwarting Trump's policies because the media didn't [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=576.64s)]
*  like his policies such as when he ordered them to remove troops from Syria and they [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=583.64s)]
*  deceived him and played games and refused to do so. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=587.88s)]
*  Now there is an exception, a very rare one, where if Trump gave orders to torture for [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=590.76s)]
*  example or to engage in other forms of illegalities, the military not only has the right but the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=596.88s)]
*  duty to disobey. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=605.48s)]
*  But that's not what we're talking about here. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=607.24s)]
*  The idea that generals and other people in the military obey the commander in chief is [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=609.84s)]
*  fundamental to how our country functions and yet they're depicting this as some sort of [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=613.08s)]
*  bizarre fascist aberration that Trump was irritated that often his generals undermined [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=618.28s)]
*  his policies rather than carried them out. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=622.88s)]
*  The article goes on, quote, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=625.24s)]
*  Trump said in a private conversation in the White House according to two people who heard [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=641.24s)]
*  him say this. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=645.0799999999999s)]

*  And so seeing these polls not just being tightened but getting worse for Kamala Harris, a very [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1215.78s)]
*  real possibility of what they consider apocalyptic, which would be Donald Trump's reelection, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1221.8600000000001s)]
*  is I think driving them actually a lot of them crazy and they just don't know what to [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1228.1000000000001s)]
*  do anymore. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1232.66s)]
*  And so it's like people understand that on the internet, this has been an understanding [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1234.54s)]
*  for many years, that when people just get extremely frustrated and at wit's end on the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1240.82s)]
*  internet, just extremely angry, no ability to say anything, they just start screaming [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1247.58s)]
*  Hitler and Nazis at people, calling people Nazis and Hitler's. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1254.74s)]
*  It was like a joke to the point where a law got invented, Godwin's law, that essentially [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1257.62s)]
*  said that eventually every bad faith internet discourse ends with people calling themselves [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1264.1s)]
*  or calling each other Hitler and Nazis. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1271.26s)]
*  And this is, I think, where liberal elites are at. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1274.48s)]
*  And if you look at polling data about what Americans care about, about the kind of messaging [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1277.96s)]
*  that resonates with them, this is what Hillary Clinton tried to do. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1283.44s)]
*  She constantly said Donald Trump is the most dangerous candidate in all of American history. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1288.1200000000001s)]
*  And even though you don't like me and I may not do much for you in your view, the fact [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1295.1200000000001s)]
*  that he's so dangerous means you have to vote for me. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1298.8s)]
*  And that's what they were told over and over by these elite institutions that they despise, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1302.32s)]
*  and they ended up voting for Donald Trump in large numbers in a way that genuinely traumatized [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1307.9199999999998s)]
*  the liberal elite class. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  And they feel like they're living in deja vu and are petrified and don't know what to [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1315.9199999999998s)]
*  do. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1319.84s)]
*  And so instead of learning from their mistakes, instead of trying to offer some positive agenda [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1320.84s)]
*  for what they're going to actually do to improve the lives of people who feel abandoned by [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1326.3999999999999s)]
*  the status quo represented by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, they're just almost unhinged [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1330.52s)]
*  at this point, constantly invoking Hitler and fascism and claiming Trump secretly harbors [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1337.52s)]
*  a love of Adolf Hitler, which again might work if Trump were this blank slate to people. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1345.28s)]
*  The opposite is true. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1356.52s)]
*  Donald Trump has been extremely famous in the United States for five decades. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1357.68s)]
*  I remember living in New York City when I went to law school in the late 1980s and early [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1362.2s)]
*  1990s, and he was this gigantic cultural figure. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1366.96s)]
*  And he wasn't just a gigantic cultural figure. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1371.3200000000002s)]
*  He was beloved by all elites. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1373.0s)]
*  He went on Oprah Winfrey's show and she all but encouraged him to run for president. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1376.44s)]
*  And here, let's just take a look at how he used to be treated, this Adolf Hitler figure. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1384.72s)]
*  Full page ad in major U.S. newspapers last year criticizing U.S. foreign policy. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1390.56s)]
*  What would you do differently, Donald? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1395.24s)]
*  I'd make our allies, forgetting about the enemies, the enemies you can't talk to so [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1396.72s)]
*  easily, I'd make our allies pay their fair share. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1400.28s)]
*  We're a debtor nation. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1403.2s)]
*  Something's going to happen over the next number of years with this country because [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1404.52s)]
*  you can't keep going on losing 200 billion and yet we let Japan come in and dump everything [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1406.84s)]
*  right into our markets. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1411.76s)]
*  It's not free trade. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1413.72s)]
*  If you ever go to Japan right now and try to sell something, forget about it, Oprah. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1414.72s)]
*  Just forget about it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1418.3600000000001s)]
*  It's almost impossible. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1419.3600000000001s)]
*  They don't have laws against it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1420.3600000000001s)]
*  They just make it impossible. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1421.3600000000001s)]
*  They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, they knock the hell out of our [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1422.92s)]
*  companies and hey, I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1426.32s)]
*  I mean, you can respect somebody that's beating the hell out of you, but they are beating [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1429.84s)]
*  the hell out of this country. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1433.04s)]
*  Kuwait, they live like kings. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1434.44s)]
*  The poorest person in Kuwait, they live like kings and yet they're not paying. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1436.02s)]
*  We make it possible for them to sell their oil. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1439.68s)]
*  Why aren't they paying us 25% of what they're making? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1442.2s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1444.8s)]
*  This sounds like political presidential talk to me and I know people have talked to you [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1445.8s)]
*  about whether or not you want to run. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1449.76s)]
*  Would you ever? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1451.64s)]
*  Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country rip. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1453.22s)]
*  Why would you not? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1456.52s)]
*  I just don't think I really have the inclination to do it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1457.52s)]
*  I love what I'm doing. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1460.52s)]
*  I really like it. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1461.52s)]
*  Also, it doesn't pay as well. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1462.52s)]
*  No, but I just probably wouldn't do it, Oprah. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1464.44s)]
*  I probably wouldn't, but I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1468.32s)]
*  and if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally because I really am tired [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1471.7199999999998s)]
*  of seeing what's happening with this country, how we're really making other people live [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1475.8799999999999s)]
*  like kings and we're not. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1480.4399999999998s)]
*  So there's the new Adolf Hitler figure chatting it up with an obviously very respectful and [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1482.7199999999998s)]
*  admiring Oprah Winfrey all the way back in 1998, which is 40 years ago. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1489.32s)]
*  And this is how Trump has been his entire life until he began running for president. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1497.6s)]
*  As Democrats are calling him Hitler, here from Politico this week, a new poll, Trump [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1505.12s)]
*  is getting record levels of support among black and Latino men. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1511.24s)]
*  And it describes how there's this huge migration, and we've seen this before, of black and Latino [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1518.9599999999998s)]
*  men toward Donald Trump, sort of a very weird voting pattern for the new Adolf Hitler. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1523.76s)]
*  I just want to say there are these kind of Democratic pundits, these idiots on cable, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1530.8400000000001s)]
*  these incredibly hyper-partisan people who really do talk themselves into the frenzy, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1536.6000000000001s)]
*  but actual Democratic, sophisticated Democratic leaders obviously don't believe this. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1543.1200000000001s)]
*  Here is from last week at that Al Smith dinner that has traditionally been attended by both [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1548.48s)]
*  major party candidates, they kind of roast each other. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1555.1999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris refused to attend, but Trump attended and so did Chuck Schumer. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1558.12s)]
*  And here's Chuck Schumer off on the side having a very intimate conversation with Trump, who [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1564.1999999999998s)]
*  Schumer has known for years. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1569.36s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is a Jewish Democrat and somebody who exercised a lot of power in Washington. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1572.4s)]
*  Does this look to you like Chuck Schumer believes that Donald Trump is some sort of Hitler-like figure? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1579.64s)]
*  And maybe what's going on here is that Schumer is trying to get into Trump, that he should [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1586.84s)]
*  build his concentration camps in the state of New York because of the tax benefits and [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1594.24s)]
*  the jobs it would bring to New York. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1599.16s)]
*  Whatever this is, it doesn't seem like Chuck Schumer believes that Donald Trump is a Hitler-like [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1602.1200000000001s)]
*  figure and to make this narrative central to a campaign that seems to be faltering, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1609.1200000000001s)]
*  that the American people have repeatedly made clear they do not believe, they don't think [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1617.3200000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump, even the ones who dislike him, is Adolf Hitler, out to put them in concentration [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1621.64s)]
*  camps and murder minorities, many of whom are increasingly going to Trump's campaign. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1628.56s)]
*  It just is a sign of the reasons why these institutions are hated, why this gap is growing [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  and growing and I think why Democrats have no positive agenda. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1640.2399999999998s)]
*  People know that. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1645.12s)]
*  Kamala can't even answer a question and so in lieu of that they're relying on this extreme [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1646.12s)]
*  hysteria that, as I said, I have no idea who's going to win, I don't think anyone does. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1651.52s)]
*  But again, if she wins, it will be despite this kind of an issue and most definitely [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1658.04s)]
*  not because of it. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4kCewkwRE&t=1662.1999999999998s)]
