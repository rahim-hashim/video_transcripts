# WATCH: Nikki Haley Demands BAN on Online Anonymity | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo)
*  Nikki Haley is somebody that we've been increasingly focused on on this program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=0.0s)]
*  She of course is the former Republican governor, two-term governor of South Carolina, also [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=11.32s)]
*  the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations currently seeking the Republican presidential [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=15.96s)]
*  nomination. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=21.56s)]
*  And the reason we've been focusing on her is several fold. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=24.04s)]
*  One is she has reasonable polling numbers, at least to the extent that anybody can say [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=26.72s)]
*  to have reasonable polling numbers in a presidential race where one candidate has had a 40 to 45 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=36.44s)]
*  point national lead for almost a year now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=41.96s)]
*  She's also becoming the obvious establishment candidate, the one they intend to pour enormous [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=47.96s)]
*  amounts of money into propping up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=53.54s)]
*  That's part of why we're focused on her, but also because she is monstrous. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=56.78s)]
*  She is a dangerous, fanatical human being. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=62.74s)]
*  And I know this can seem less important than other things she said. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=68.94s)]
*  It's not though, because this came from a place of instinct. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  I don't think this is a very well thought through policy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  I think she went online, she went on Fox, she kind of let her real self kind of fly [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=82.54s)]
*  and listened to what she said. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=90.74s)]
*  And obviously by the way, the context of this, just like the show we did yesterday, remember [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=92.9s)]
*  we talked about the launching by New York governor Kathy Hochul, the Democrat from New [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=99.28s)]
*  York, of a new online social media surveillance campaign justified in the name of this narrative [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=104.38s)]
*  that anti-Semitism is so dangerous. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=113.34s)]
*  I had people right before I went on my show on Twitter telling me that American Jews can't [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=114.34s)]
*  even leave their house. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=118.14s)]
*  That's how endangered they are in the United States. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=119.14s)]
*  In the name of that narrative, she was saying, Governor Hochul, that we need to monitor social [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=123.18s)]
*  media more, we need to aggressively seek out people who are posting hateful thoughts and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=126.7s)]
*  counteract them, reach out to them to correct that behavior, she said. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=130.8s)]
*  That was the context for Nikki Haley's interview on Fox. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=135.12s)]
*  So you see the onscreen cry on Ambassador Nikki Haley on the explosion of anti-Semitism. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=138.18s)]
*  And here's what she said. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=143.18s)]
*  When I get into office, the first thing we have to do, social media accounts, social [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  media companies, they have to show America their algorithms. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=149.74s)]
*  Let us see why they're pushing what they're pushing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=153.02s)]
*  The second thing is every person on social media should be verified by their name. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  First of all, it's a national security threat. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  When you do that, all of a sudden people have to stand by what they say and it gets [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=163.5s)]
*  rid of the Russian bots, the Iranian bots, and the Chinese bots. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=167.82s)]
*  And then you're going to get some civility when people know their name is next to what [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=171.5s)]
*  they say. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=175.52s)]
*  Accountability. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=176.52s)]
*  And they know their pastor and their family member is going to see it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=177.52s)]
*  It's going to help our kids and it's going to help our country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=179.7s)]
*  First of all, I can't tell you how many times Nikki Haley speaks and in the middle of her [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=182.1s)]
*  sentence she just throws in this phrase, it's national security. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=186.7s)]
*  That is already an authoritarian way of thinking about the world. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=192.68s)]
*  Everything's about security, nothing about rights. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  Always on the far end of pretending that she's devoted to security, always on the opposite [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=197.78s)]
*  end of where individual rights reside. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=204.12s)]
*  That's just an authoritarian instinct that she has. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=206.12s)]
*  But to say that nobody should be able to be on social media unless they're first registered [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=210.56s)]
*  and verified with their identity and have to post under their legal name, I don't think [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  I've ever heard anybody advocate that before. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=220.84s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people have said, who are online? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=223.76s)]
*  Oh, people who are anonymous abuse their anonymity. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=228.44s)]
*  For sure that's true. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=231.56s)]
*  I can't tell you how many repulsive things have been said to me because people hide behind [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  their anonymity. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=239.16s)]
*  There are anonymous websites about me that contain fabrications and forgeries and slander [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=240.24s)]
*  and lies that they're able to do because of anonymity. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=246.28s)]
*  I understand the cost of anonymity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=248.76s)]
*  But anonymous free speech is crucial. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  The ability to speak under an pseudonym or under anonymity, especially in a climate like [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=254.56s)]
*  we have where people get fired routinely for expressing their views or worse, is crucial. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=260.36s)]
*  The irony of it is that what shaped our constitution were the Federalist Papers. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=266.68s)]
*  Those were the arguments that were advanced by people like Alexander Hamilton and James [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=271.4s)]
*  Madison to argue in favor of the US Constitution and the enactment of the American Republic. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=276.56s)]
*  And they used pseudonym, publius, for doing so. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=281.76s)]
*  They didn't want their real names attached to it for a variety of reasons, including [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=286.4s)]
*  they didn't want the distraction on the personality. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=289.3s)]
*  Mark Twain wrote under pen names, people have used pseudonyms and anonymity forever. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=292.68s)]
*  It's a critical part of political speech. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=298.04s)]
*  And yet it wasn't actually the first time Nikki Haley has said this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=302.44s)]
*  So while a lot of people, including myself, will rant and rave against cowardly idiots [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=305.0s)]
*  who exploit anonymity for nefarious ends, I would never dream of wanting a law to prohibit [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=311.68s)]
*  it because the benefits of allowing people to speak anonymously, to empower people, to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=316.48s)]
*  enable them who might be endangered in some way in other countries, in our country if [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=322.8s)]
*  they speak out is so much greater. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=327.68s)]
*  The benefits are then the cost. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  But she said it before. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=337.08s)]
*  Here she is on the Ruthless podcast saying it again. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=338.68s)]
*  Listen to what she said here. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=342.24s)]
*  They need to verify every single person on their outlet because and I want it by name [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=343.8s)]
*  because when about smug, does he, does he qualify? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=351.52s)]
*  I've provided them with my government. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=354.44s)]
*  If smug is on your driver's license, then look, you can put smug in parentheses, but [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=357.88s)]
*  I want everybody's name. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=362.88s)]
*  I want it by name. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=365.64s)]
*  I want those names attached to people speaking by social media. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=366.92s)]
*  This created a huge backlash over the last day or so. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=374.41999999999996s)]
*  She was attacked by Ron DeSantis and his campaign. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=378.52s)]
*  She was attacked by Vivek Ramaswamy and his campaign. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=380.68s)]
*  She was attacked by most conservatives to their credit along with everybody I saw on [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=384.0s)]
*  the liberal left. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=389.6s)]
*  I mean, she unified people in disgust and horror. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=390.6s)]
*  Here she is trying to walk this back. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=394.72s)]
*  She went on to CNBC earlier today and tried to pretend that she was only talking about [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=396.28s)]
*  foreigners even though it makes no sense. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=404.6s)]
*  But even in this interview, she kind of repeated the same thing in the attempt to walk it back. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=407.62s)]
*  Listen to what she said. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=411.28s)]
*  We need our social media companies to verify everybody so that we can get all of those [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=412.72s)]
*  nonsense. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=417.8s)]
*  You're not really saying that people can't tweet anonymously. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=418.8s)]
*  But that's bad enough because you see what it's doing to our kids and bullying and everything. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  Do I think life would be more civil if we were able to do that? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, it's the same reason why I think doxing, you should stand by what you say. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=430.24s)]
*  But no, if you can have anonymous, I don't mind anonymous American people having free [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  speech. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=440.32s)]
*  What I don't like is anonymous Russians and Chinese and Iranians having free speech. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=441.32s)]
*  No, obviously that's not what she said. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=445.8s)]
*  That's not what she meant. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=447.72s)]
*  And how would you only be able to force Russian and Chinese and Iranian people to use their [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  names? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=459.44s)]
*  How would you know they're Iranian, Russian and Chinese unless you knew everybody's identity? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=460.44s)]
*  She felt like she had to step back from the controversy, but she still wants that policy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=466.4s)]
*  Now this is not the first time this issue has been raised. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=473.88s)]
*  There are a lot of states in the United States over the years that have tried to get people [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=478.67999999999995s)]
*  to or require people to present their name, to use their name in connection with any political [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=486.06s)]
*  speech. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=491.96s)]
*  There are all kinds of Supreme Court cases adjudicating the constitutionality of state [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=492.96s)]
*  or local law that has said, which Nikki Haley said, which is if you want to be heard, if [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=498.44s)]
*  you want to circulate pamphlets, if you want to circulate political speech, you have to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=502.68s)]
*  put your name on it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=506.4s)]
*  And people wanted to circulate pamphlets with controversial views. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=508.76s)]
*  They didn't want their name on it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  They put a group name on it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=512.68s)]
*  They were punished. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=513.68s)]
*  They were arrested. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=514.68s)]
*  They were prosecuted. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=515.68s)]
*  They were fined. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=516.68s)]
*  And it went to the Supreme Court. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=517.68s)]
*  Every case, usually unanimously the Supreme Court said, you can't force people to attach [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=518.68s)]
*  their names in the United States to their speech. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=526.68s)]
*  Of course, speaking anonymously is a core First Amendment right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=529.2399999999999s)]
*  Here back in 1960, 63 years ago, the US Supreme Court unanimously in Talley versus California [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=534.52s)]
*  said the following, quote, the question presented here is whether the provisions of a Los Angeles [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=543.24s)]
*  City ordinance restricting the distribution of the handbills, quote, abridged the freedom [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=548.56s)]
*  of speech and of the press secured against state invasion by the 14th Amendment of the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=553.9599999999999s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  The provision, the city ordinance stated, quote, no person shall distribute any handbill [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=560.88s)]
*  in any place under any circumstance which does not have printed on the cover or the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=567.64s)]
*  face thereof the name and address of the following. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=573.0s)]
*  A, the person who printed, wrote, compiled, or manufactured the same and then it had a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=576.64s)]
*  whole long list. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  But the essence of what it had to have, it was illegal to distribute any handbill in [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=581.5999999999999s)]
*  any place under any circumstance unless it has on the face of it the name and address [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=588.3599999999999s)]
*  of the following person, the person who printed, wrote. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  So that was the ordinance, very similar to what Nikki Haley wanted. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  Here's what the court said unanimously, quote, anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=602.92s)]
*  and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=609.64s)]
*  Persecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=615.16s)]
*  oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=619.0s)]
*  The obnoxious press licensing law of England, which was also enforced on the colonies, was [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=625.2199999999999s)]
*  due in part to the knowledge that exposure of the names of printers, writers, and distributors [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=632.08s)]
*  would lessen the circulation of literature critical of the government. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=636.44s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=641.24s)]
*  One of the key abuses of the British crown that gave rise to the American Revolution [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=643.84s)]
*  was a law that the Supreme Court in 1960 called obnoxious that did what Nikki Haley wants [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=649.88s)]
*  to do, which was require the name of anybody who wants to criticize the government or speak [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=658.96s)]
*  and be heard in public. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=665.56s)]
*  The court went on and said, the old seditious libel cases in England show the lengths to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=669.6s)]
*  which government had to go to find out who was responsible for books that were obnoxious [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=680.76s)]
*  to the rulers. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=685.7s)]
*  We have recently had occasion to hold in two cases that there are times and circumstances [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=687.6s)]
*  when states may not compel members of groups engage in the dissemination of ideas to be [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=691.48s)]
*  publicly identified. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=696.76s)]
*  And it cites Bates versus Little Rock and the NAACP versus Alabama. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=699.4s)]
*  And those cases are really interesting because there were groups, the NAACP and others, that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=703.72s)]
*  were very controversial at the time. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  The governments wanted to get the list of the names of the people in those groups. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=712.32s)]
*  And the Supreme Court said no, that would violate freedom of association. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=718.1600000000001s)]
*  People have a right to associate without having their names dragged out into public because [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=721.96s)]
*  if they can't associate and join groups secretly, then the ability to join controversial groups [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=725.7600000000001s)]
*  that are critical of the government, that are critical of majoritarian sentiment will [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=732.48s)]
*  be compromised. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=736.0600000000001s)]
*  It's a long line of cases going back decades. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=737.0600000000001s)]
*  And then here's what the court said on this case, quote, the reason for those holdings [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=742.04s)]
*  was that identification and fear of reprisal might deter a perfectly peaceful discussion [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=746.04s)]
*  of public matters of importance. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=751.06s)]
*  This broad Los Angeles ordinance is subject to the same infirmity. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=754.04s)]
*  We hold that it, like the Griffin Georgia ordinance, is void on its face. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=758.4599999999999s)]
*  Not even a close call. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=765.68s)]
*  The court had disgust and contempt on First Amendment grounds for Nikki Haley's mindset [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=767.88s)]
*  43 years before she decided to advocate something that has long been deemed radically unconstitutional. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=771.92s)]
*  Here's a 1995 Supreme Court case from McIntyre versus Ohio elections where the court said [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=781.32s)]
*  the following, quote, the question presented is whether an Ohio statute that prohibits [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=787.2s)]
*  the distribution of anonymous campaign literature is a, quote, law abridging the freedom of [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=792.04s)]
*  speech within the meaning of the First Amendment. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=796.68s)]
*  Quote, anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures, and even books have played an important role [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=799.4s)]
*  in the progress of mankind, citing that tally case. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=803.9599999999999s)]
*  Great works of literature have frequently been produced by authors writing under assumed [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=807.88s)]
*  names. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=811.88s)]
*  Despite readers' curiosity and the public's interest in identifying the creator of a work [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=813.52s)]
*  of art, an author generally is free to decide whether or not to disclose his or her true [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=817.4799999999999s)]
*  identity. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=822.4s)]
*  The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=824.28s)]
*  re-American names such as Mark Twain, Samuel Ankhorn Clemens, and O. Henry, William Sidney [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  Porter, comradely to mind. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=835.16s)]
*  Benjamin Franklin employed numerous different pseudonyms. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=837.04s)]
*  Whatever the motivation may be, at least in the field of literary endeavor, the interest [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=841.3199999999999s)]
*  in having anonymous works enter the marketplace of ideas unquestionably outweighs any public [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=844.76s)]
*  interest unquestionably and requiring disclosure as a condition of entry. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=850.08s)]
*  Accordingly, an author's decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=855.6s)]
*  omissions or additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=859.84s)]
*  speech protected by the First Amendment. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=864.2s)]
*  The fact that Nikki Haley didn't know that the Federalist Papers were written anonymously, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=868.3000000000001s)]
*  documents and tracts and pamphlets as central to the founding of the country she wants to [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=876.0400000000001s)]
*  lead as any is...I don't know what to say about that. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=879.64s)]
*  I remember in law school reading the Federalist Papers over and over and over and over, being [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=886.24s)]
*  so enamored of them. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=891.16s)]
*  And if you go and read the earliest writings that I published when I first started writing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=892.96s)]
*  about politics and the war on terror and the erosion of civil liberties, I constantly cited [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=897.68s)]
*  those because they were foundational to my worldview. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=901.48s)]
*  They still are and they were written anonymously under a pseudonym to conceal the identity [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=904.24s)]
*  of those authoring it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=909.44s)]
*  I mean, this is so basic and this is what I mean. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=910.96s)]
*  It's one thing if she had sat down and formed this very conscious decision to advocate an [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=915.12s)]
*  unconstitutional policy because she thought there'd be political advantage to it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=922.74s)]
*  That's not what happened here. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=928.2s)]
*  She was just kind of speaking off the cuff angrily. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=929.2s)]
*  She probably got accused or attacked on social media by anonymous people and she's like, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=932.14s)]
*  ban them, ban that, don't allow that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=936.64s)]
*  That is an authoritarian instinct. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=939.3s)]
*  That is a despot's mindset. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=942.3599999999999s)]
*  And that's what Nikki Haley is and it's a big reason why the Republican establishment [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=946.0999999999999s)]
*  is so eager on ensuring she's the nominee. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBUOJBYixGo&t=950.9399999999999s)]
