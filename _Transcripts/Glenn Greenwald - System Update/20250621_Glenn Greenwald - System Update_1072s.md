# What Marjorie Taylor Greene's Rise Reveals About DC Elites
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k)
*  This one is from Winn Everett and Winn asked the following quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=0.0s)]
*  the two political functions in America have become so divorced from the typical Americans [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=11.44s)]
*  concerns that they appear almost deranged. There's an absolute chasm in politics right now and wide [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=17.04s)]
*  material agreement among most Americans regarding big ticket items like avoiding foreign wars and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=23.36s)]
*  healthcare. There are millions and millions of voters that are totally gettable in any way they [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=28.88s)]
*  have never been before. Do you think a third or even a fourth party could be viable and under what [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=33.76s)]
*  circumstances or conditions? All right, I could not agree more with all of that. I think a major [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=38.64s)]
*  reason for Donald Trump's victories and by victory I mean starting in 2016 when he was [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=47.28s)]
*  never even remotely considered a candidate or politician and he's gunned down the field of all [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=53.28s)]
*  those professional highly funded Republican politicians from starting with Jeb Bush and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=59.44s)]
*  Marco Rubio and Ted Crick all through them got the nomination and then crushed the Clinton [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=64.72s)]
*  political machine obviously filled with nothing but political animals, long-term [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=71.36s)]
*  professional career politicians is precisely for this reason. People understand that both political [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=76.32s)]
*  parties speak a language, live in a world, spend money on things, talk about things, vote on things, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=83.04s)]
*  completely detached from their concerns and their lives and that's why they've lost faith and trust [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=90.0s)]
*  in most institutes of authority because they perceive correctly that people in power who are [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=95.04s)]
*  there to essentially represent them care about everything other than what they care about. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=101.04s)]
*  It's so incredibly obvious from how these people speak to what they say and Donald Trump was the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  first to come along and sort of break all those rules that people have come to hate [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=111.76s)]
*  about how they speak, how they talk, what they talk about, the things you're allowed to say [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  and he was basically a weapon to smash that glass, to smash the system that they were so [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  eager to smash. Now obviously Donald Trump is now a politician there's no denying that, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  doesn't mean it's bad, doesn't mean it's good. He's been president for four years, spent four more years [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=130.72s)]
*  running for president, is now president again. So the last 10 years of our political lives have been [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=135.44s)]
*  dominated by the political figure of Donald Trump, it's clearly the Trump era of politics. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=140.72s)]
*  He's not really an outsider force anymore. He can't be president twice and having run a third time [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=146.08s)]
*  and almost won, just constantly running for president for 10 years and be a political outsider [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=152.8s)]
*  anymore. He's still an outsider in a lot of different ways, comportmentally and the like but [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=157.12s)]
*  it's not as appealing I think as it once was and especially now that we're watching in his [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=162.88s)]
*  the first four months of his term, five months of his first term, it was consumed by things like [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=170.72s)]
*  tariffs which was a base major promise of the Trump campaign no doubt but I think people ended [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  up feeling like economically they had been beaten upon and crushed for so long including [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=182.4s)]
*  by the Biden years that there was even Trump admitted short-term pain, the stock market became [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=188.24s)]
*  unstable, it went down, people's investments and retirements funds became less valuable, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=193.04s)]
*  small businesses struggled so that was already kind of a feeling that wow we have Trump again [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=198.4s)]
*  who promised to help us in the working class but instead we seem to be suffering with this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=203.84s)]
*  tariff policy that we're being told will have long-term benefits but for the moment we don't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=209.84s)]
*  seem to have them and now political discourse is being dominated by a potential war with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=214.96s)]
*  Iran that I just don't think most people have spent the last two years caring about or I don't [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=224.64s)]
*  think people think like you know I used to always say about Russia when Democrats are spending all [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  that time on the evils of Putin and the threats posed by Russia that it's just so obviously [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  there's a huge gap between what Democrats spend all their time talking and warning about [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  and what Americans wake up and thinking about there I just know that Americans are not waking [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=247.2s)]
*  up worried about Vladimir Putin and the threat posed by Russia that's not something they're [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=252.48s)]
*  scared about they were during the Cold War when nuclear war was very possible people were taught [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=257.12s)]
*  to live in shelters go to shelters that was very much part of the culture and there was a existential [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=265.28s)]
*  war between communism and capitalism and there's a lot at stake but people don't worry about Russia [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=271.44s)]
*  anymore they don't consider Vladimir Putin one of the leading threats to their well-being unless [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=279.2s)]
*  you are an MSNBC viewer and so there was this gigantic gap between what Democrats were talking [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=283.36s)]
*  about and what people care about I think that's the reason that they ended up losing but now you [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=288.8s)]
*  look at what Republicans have talked about what has Trump done aside from tariffs he's gotten in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  and he resumed a bombing campaign in Yemen against Houthis and unleashed the Israelis again to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=298.24s)]
*  continue their destruction of Gaza which the United States is paying for started deporting [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=308.32s)]
*  not people in the United States illegally or who have committed crimes but people who were guilty [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=314.64s)]
*  of the crime of protesting Israel or speaking out against Israel I think that's what people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=318.32s)]
*  were worried about people in the country legally PhD students Fulbright scholars biologists chemists [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=323.92s)]
*  with nothing but a record of achievement being booted out with new precedent because they spoke [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=331.68s)]
*  out against Israel and people were definitely worried about illegal immigration especially [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=341.04s)]
*  people who are dangerous to their children or their communities you think they're worried about [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=344.8s)]
*  Harvard and Yale biologists who wrote op-eds about Israel so a lot of that as well and now we have [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=348.4s)]
*  this war with Iran which you know if you ask you can get polling answers or polling data about [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=360.0s)]
*  anything the way you want based on how you ask the question so if you say look Iran is about to get [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  a nuclear weapon should the United States do nothing or should it try and do what it can even [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  if it means military force to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon people agree yeah we [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon but if you say Israel has launched a war against Iran [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=381.76s)]
*  do you think the United States should involve itself militarily in a new foreign war in the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=389.04s)]
*  Middle East overwhelmingly people say no and there's polls showing both and I don't care [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=393.36s)]
*  what the polling data is in terms of you ask somebody do you want Iran to have nuclear weapons [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  yes or no I do not believe that Americans are waking up saying in the morning like wow I couldn't [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  sleep last night because I'm really worried about the prospect that Iran is going to get nuclear [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  weapons by every account they don't even have the missile capability to send one to the United States [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  even if they could why would they North Korea doesn't everyone understand it's going to be [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  immediate mutual suicide I just don't think that's what people care about in their lives [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=421.68s)]
*  and polls constantly should have shown that I don't think people elected Donald Trump to go to war [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  with Iran or to restart the bombing campaign against the Houthis and that's all they're hearing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  about now that's what the Trump administration is focused on which is not what the American people [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=438.48s)]
*  are focused on I know this from polling data from it's just it's I cover politics and we've [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=442.96s)]
*  all seen over time what Americans care about and what they don't care about and when they feel like [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  their interests are ignored and when they interests are not now let me I want to just answer this with [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=454.56s)]
*  a story about Marjorie Taylor Greene not really a story so much as kind of a my my my thoughts on [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=460.08s)]
*  my my thoughts on Marjorie Taylor Greene so I want to be very honest and say that I really [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=467.36s)]
*  like Marjorie Taylor Greene I have always liked Marjorie Taylor Greene I think she's a good person [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=473.44000000000005s)]
*  I think she's sincere and earnest about the things she says and believes obviously Marjorie Taylor [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=478.0s)]
*  Greene has said things over the last many years that I don't agree with that you can describe as [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=486.48s)]
*  whatever outside of the realm of what reality is I think most politicians do [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=492.88s)]
*  I think Donald Trump running around talking about how Ron's about to get a nuclear weapon and use it [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=500.08s)]
*  or whatever that's way outside the realm of of reality to say nothing of what was said about [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=503.2s)]
*  the Iraq war and the 2008 financial crisis but the reason I like Marjorie Taylor Greene is because [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=508.48s)]
*  she is what a lot of people wanted were so found so attracted about Trump Marjorie Taylor Greene was [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=516.4s)]
*  never a politician she didn't run she wasn't like on the city council and then in the state [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=523.36s)]
*  legislature in Georgia and then working her way up to the Georgia state senate and being groomed [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=528.32s)]
*  by the Republican party to one day run for Congress you know like kind of a career politician that was [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=532.0s)]
*  not Marjorie Taylor Greene Marjorie Taylor Greene was you know a she has a business she's she the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=537.12s)]
*  business is is prosperous she's not like incredibly rich but probably like upper middle class [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=542.88s)]
*  she lives on an upscale you know Georgia suburb and she became very politically active by the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=549.44s)]
*  MAGA movement in America first it like resonated with her just as a citizen and then she got [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=557.6s)]
*  politically involved and probably had some connections and money that helped but no like [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=562.0s)]
*  she wasn't just in a part of a political dynasty her father wasn't the governor or anything she [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=567.2s)]
*  really like just did the kind of classic Mr. Smith goes to Washington type of political trajectory [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=572.0s)]
*  where a citizen wakes up and says you know I really am starting to get angry and concerned by what my [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=580.24s)]
*  government is doing I think it's totally on the wrong track the things they're saying make no sense [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't think they're representing our interest and she got very inspired by Donald Trump and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=589.76s)]
*  the MAGA movement and took it seriously and she suddenly became a member of Congress and yeah [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=594.48s)]
*  because she's somebody who was not a trained politician she often was not on script and she's [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=600.48s)]
*  charismatic and she says things that get people riled up and that brings a lot of media attention [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=606.96s)]
*  so that builds that's why there's so much attention on Jasmine Crockett as well not because she's some [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=611.12s)]
*  important figure in the House Democratic caucus but because she says things that get people angry [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=617.2s)]
*  and cable news loves that and builds those people with a big platform and that's what happens to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=622.0s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene but I don't think Marjorie Taylor Greene was ever doing or saying things on [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=626.16s)]
*  purpose to make people angry I think she was doing and saying things that she really believed in [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=630.08s)]
*  that if you go to her district I guarantee you people like her people who live near her people [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=634.64s)]
*  who live in her district are also saying which is why they voted for her and keep reelecting her [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=640.8s)]
*  despite how much the media hates her and says she's so evil and bad and I've talked to her before [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=645.6s)]
*  I found her to be exactly the same when talking personally to her as I have when I've listened to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=652.0s)]
*  her in public I've had her on the show before and one of the things that really I found so [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=658.8s)]
*  interesting and so kind of eye-opening about Marjorie Taylor Greene is you know she's been [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=666.72s)]
*  reluctant to criticize Donald Trump too much previously I remember I had her on the show she [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=674.8s)]
*  was one of those people where she was very much against the Ukraine war making all those good [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=681.2s)]
*  arguments that I agree with about how we have you know women who can't get baby formula and our [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=685.44s)]
*  communities are falling apart why are we sending billions to finance a war that has nothing to do [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=689.44s)]
*  with us I remember asked her like does that apply to Israel that rationale it seems like it should [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=692.96s)]
*  does it and she was kind of she wasn't enough the confidence to say like yeah also Israel you know [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=697.44s)]
*  that's a very sensitive topic she knows that but sometimes you get to Washington and you got to [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=701.76s)]
*  find your way you've got to understand how things work especially if you're not a career [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=707.84s)]
*  politician I remember when I started journalism there was a lot of things I didn't understand [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=711.84s)]
*  I hadn't done it full-time I thought I knew about things but once I really started looking I started [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  learning things and realizing how much I didn't know and so it took me a while to kind of get [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=720.16s)]
*  my legs and feel like okay I have a good secure sense of where things are and I think that's where [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=725.68s)]
*  she is and when Donald Trump announced this new bombing campaign in Yemen she was very outspoken [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=729.76s)]
*  against it and the way she made the argument really struck me she said you know what I've been a [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=738.96s)]
*  congresswoman now for six years or whatever it is representing my district but I've lived my [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=746.24s)]
*  district forever nobody in my district even knows what a Houthi is nobody talks about Houthis nobody [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=750.16s)]
*  has met Houthis nobody is threatened by Houthis nobody fears Houthis nobody understands why are [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=756.32s)]
*  we spending all this money to bomb the Houthis what does this have to do with us I thought about [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=761.2800000000001s)]
*  it I was like you know that's the benefit of having people who are not professional politicians [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=766.88s)]
*  one of the things that was made Kamala Harris such a terrible candidate is that she worked her way [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  up that ladder from her mid-20s she's basically been a politician her whole life she got elected [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  to San Francisco district attorney very ambitious you can go find national interviews with her [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=784.24s)]
*  because she was doing things like imprisoning parents for truancy if their kids didn't go to [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=790.48s)]
*  school and good morning America and those types of shows loved her she was on there she parlayed [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=794.0s)]
*  that into a run for attorney general of California won that worked her way up to the senate California [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=799.12s)]
*  senate and then became vice president and she never had a moment where she was off script where [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=807.92s)]
*  she was saying things that people in Washington be like what what is that she clung to those scripts [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=814.0799999999999s)]
*  like her life depended on it she was petrified of saying anything that official Washington would [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=820.56s)]
*  find odd or strange or disapprove of and as a result she was totally vacant she never spoke [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=825.5999999999999s)]
*  naturally she never spoke like a human being because that's all she knows is she's been clicked [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  into the political system and she speaks about the things that her donors care about that other [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=835.12s)]
*  politicians care about that the media she consumes talks about and it's completely she has no ability [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=840.16s)]
*  to say what Marjorie Taylor Greene said no courage to say it even if she understood it but no piece [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=846.48s)]
*  for understanding it either now you can take that too far you know before 9 11 nobody in America for [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=850.5600000000001s)]
*  the most part understood what al-qaeda was thought much about al-qaeda didn't mean the government [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=857.76s)]
*  should not do anything about al-qaeda of course sometimes the government has to work on things [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=861.68s)]
*  that are real threats or problems that most people don't know about or think about or understand but [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=865.3599999999999s)]
*  I think there's a basic wisdom to the idea of asking especially when we're going to war [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  wait why are we bombing and killing these people on Yemen what do they have to do with us [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  and at the time they were not attacking American ships we've gone through that timeline before [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=882.16s)]
*  and the only reason they had been previously was because they knew we were arming and funding [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  Israel's destruction of Gaza so even that was because we were financing and fighting a war for [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=890.48s)]
*  a foreign country and the way Marjorie Taylor Greene said it was like a Houthi well who knows [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=895.76s)]
*  even my district what a Houthi is I'm not going to cheerlead a war against the Houthis that have [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=900.4s)]
*  nothing to do with the lives of the people who sent me to Washington and now when it came to [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=904.64s)]
*  this war in Iran she lost all fear or concern about recognizing the relationship between the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=909.6800000000001s)]
*  United States and Israel and in whose benefit that relationship is and who's really pushing [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=918.56s)]
*  and shaping the decisions of the United States Congress and the executive branch when it comes [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=925.04s)]
*  to war and I think she has enough confidence now she's seen enough she's learned enough she's [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  read enough she understands enough and Marjorie Taylor Greene is not dumb I'm sure Democrats will [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  say she is she's not dumb she's smart she just doesn't speak like Kamala Harris or Hillary Clinton [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=940.0799999999999s)]
*  or Joe Biden because she's not from that she doesn't emerge from that she emerged from a much [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=948.32s)]
*  different she is citizen and that was the idea by the way of the Congress was we weren't going to [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  have a professional class of politicians we're going to have people who represented their [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=959.7600000000001s)]
*  constituents get sent to Congress for a few years and go back to their lives and you know do [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=962.88s)]
*  what they were doing previously and that's the kind of person she still is she's very much still a [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=968.88s)]
*  resident of her Georgia district much more so than a creature of Washington and so she can think [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=973.5200000000001s)]
*  about things and say them in a way most Americans are still thinking and thinking of them and when [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=977.6s)]
*  it came time for the war in Iran too she was like I am just sick of having all of our money and all [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=981.36s)]
*  of our service members be put in harm's way for these wars that have nothing to do with our country [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=986.48s)]
*  Ukraine is not our country and Ukraine's wars are not our wars Israel is not our country [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=993.84s)]
*  and Israel's wars are not our wars and I think she's able to speak so plainly about these things [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=998.4s)]
*  and insist that we focus on the things that her constituents and people in America really care about [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=1002.96s)]
*  because she's not subservient to or taking orders from a political party or a kind of system and [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=1006.96s)]
*  there are other people like her in Congress too I'm not suggesting she's the only one I'm just saying [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=1017.36s)]
*  she's been very noticeable over the last three months four months because especially when it [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=1020.88s)]
*  comes to foreign policy that's where politicians typically step most delicately and she's not [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=1024.88s)]
*  stepping delicately at all and to me she's become a voice of great clarity and confidence and I think [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=1032.08s)]
*  she's earnest about everything she's saying and I think it she's talking about these things the way [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  most people talk about them [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326Xj6kyJ3k&t=1042.9599999999998s)]
