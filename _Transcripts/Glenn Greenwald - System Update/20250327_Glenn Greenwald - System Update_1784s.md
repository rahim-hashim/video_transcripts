# The Truth & LIES About the Atlantic's Signal Controversy
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4)
*  Just to remind anybody who has not heard of this story, who's fortunate enough not to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=0.0s)]
*  have heard of it, it all started yesterday when Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=10.68s)]
*  of The Atlantic, again, I think one of the most unscrupulous operatives in all of DC [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=15.8s)]
*  media, published this article after the Trump bombing campaign in Yemen resumed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=21.0s)]
*  The Biden administration had been bombing Yemen throughout 2024, despite during the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=27.46s)]
*  campaign Trump saying he opposed the bombing, thought it was unnecessary, he decided to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=32.9s)]
*  resume it and even escalate it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=37.46s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg published this article, the Trump administration accidentally texted me [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=39.82s)]
*  its war plans. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=43.74s)]
*  US national security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=45.7s)]
*  in Yemen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  I didn't think it could be real. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  Then the bomb started falling. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=52.540000000000006s)]
*  So he essentially revealed and showed screenshots of the chat that he had been included by Mike [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=55.38s)]
*  Waltz into what is obviously an extremely sensitive conversation that for some reason [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=61.580000000000005s)]
*  took place over the commercial app Signal that everybody uses for free. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=68.58s)]
*  Even though the government spends billions of dollars developing highly secure encrypted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=74.08s)]
*  communication for national security discussions, they decided to use Signal and they accidentally [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=79.9s)]
*  put Jeffrey Goldberg into their planning about how they were going to bomb Yemen, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=83.74s)]
*  which is obviously a secret, what aircraft they were going to use to bomb Yemen, what [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=89.3s)]
*  time the bombing was going to start, and that's what Jeffrey Goldberg revealed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=93.82s)]
*  And obviously what had happened was Mike Waltz had accidentally added him to the group, but [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=100.34s)]
*  and of course that's not the sort of information to which a journalist, especially a hostile [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=106.34s)]
*  journalist, but really no journalist. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=110.97999999999999s)]
*  This is clearly classified information, highly sensitive secret information for government [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=113.22s)]
*  planning a bombing campaign. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=118.66s)]
*  It's actually illegal to provide that information to someone who's not authorized to receive [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=121.3s)]
*  classified information, which is Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=126.41999999999999s)]
*  And yet they did, they did it by accident presumably, and they should have just said [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=128.66s)]
*  that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=132.7s)]
*  So instead of that, the Trump administration once Waltz came out and denied that he ever [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=133.7s)]
*  talked to Jeffrey Goldberg, didn't even think he had his contact in his phone, didn't understand [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=137.5s)]
*  how it happened, claimed that an investigation is needed to see what occurred here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=142.06s)]
*  The Trump administration went on the offense, even though they were the ones who clearly [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=146.34s)]
*  made a mistake, and began denying that there was anything sensitive about this information, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=150.46s)]
*  that there was nothing sensitive about planning, debating and then planning when to start a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=161.94s)]
*  bombing campaign in Yemen, how to start the bombing campaign in Yemen. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=169.18s)]
*  I just want you to think for a second about what would have happened had Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=174.38s)]
*  published the entire chat with all of these details we're going to show you where in the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=179.14s)]
*  chat, operational details, prior to the US going and bombing Yemen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=182.7s)]
*  Do you really believe that a single person in the Trump administration would have said, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=189.94s)]
*  oh, that's no big deal that Jeffrey Goldberg published these detailed war plans about when [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=195.14s)]
*  we were going to send our service members in harm's way, what aircraft they would use, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=201.02s)]
*  what time they would start bombing? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  They would probably charge Jeffrey Goldberg under the Espionage Act and arrest him immediately. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=206.78s)]
*  At the very least, they would have described this as a incredibly reckless and disloyal [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=213.7s)]
*  and unpatriotic treasonous thing to do by a reporter because of course this information [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  is sensitive. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=224.38s)]
*  It was only once they realized that Jeffrey Goldberg had it because they gave him access [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=226.1s)]
*  to it, did they start trying to insult your intelligence by trying to tell you there's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=230.32s)]
*  nothing at all sensitive or classified about any of this information. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=235.22s)]
*  Here's Pete Hegseth speaking on Fox News about all this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=239.5s)]
*  ...worked at here as well and looking forward to it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=243.5s)]
*  One question. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=246.5s)]
*  Can you share how your information about war plans against the Houthis in Yemen was shared [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=247.5s)]
*  with the journalists in the Atlantic and were those details classified? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=253.9s)]
*  So you're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who's made [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=258.5s)]
*  a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again to include the, I don't know, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=267.5s)]
*  the hoaxes of Russia, Russia, Russia or the fine people on both sides' hoax or suckers [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=273.38s)]
*  and losers' hoax. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=279.7s)]
*  So this is the guy that peddles in garbage. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=280.7s)]
*  This is what he does. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=283.1s)]
*  I would love to comment on the Houthi campaign because of the skill and courage of our troops. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=285.18s)]
*  I've monitored it very closely from the beginning and you see we've been managing four years [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=290.66s)]
*  of deferred maintenance under the Trump administration. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=295.98s)]
*  Our troops, our sailors were getting shot at as targets. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=299.3s)]
*  Our ships couldn't sail through and when they did shoot back it was purely defensively or [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=302.82s)]
*  at shacks in Yemen. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=307.54s)]
*  President Trump said, no more. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=309.7s)]
*  We will reestablish deterrence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=312.24s)]
*  We will open freedom of navigation and we will ultimately decimate the Houthis, which [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=314.1s)]
*  is exactly what we're doing as we speak from the beginning overwhelmingly. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=319.9s)]
*  Why were those details shared on Signal and how did you learn that a journalist was privy [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=324.54s)]
*  to the targets, the types of weapons used in the timing? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=329.02s)]
*  I've heard that was characterized, nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=332.86s)]
*  to say about that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  The NSD said it was authentic. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  Nobody was texting war plans, he said. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=343.94s)]
*  And this has been the line from the Trump administration. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=347.42s)]
*  No, there was nothing in there that's sensitive, no big deal, that we shared it with the journalists [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=348.86s)]
*  and in fact I agree with everything Pete Hegseth said about Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=352.98s)]
*  I think he's one of the most fraudulent, if not the worst most fraudulent operatives in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=356.82s)]
*  media. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  In addition to all the sins Pete Hegseth mentioned, as we've shown you before, it was Jeffrey [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  Goldberg single-handedly who invented the lie that Saddam Hussein had a close alliance [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  with Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda in order to convince Americans of what they needed [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  to be convinced of to support the war in Iraq, which was that Saddam Hussein was somehow [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=379.3s)]
*  involved in the planning of the 9-11 attack and that's why we had to go in and take him [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=384.66s)]
*  out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=388.06s)]
*  Without that lie that Jeffrey Goldberg spread all over the New Yorker and NPR and all the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=389.06s)]
*  shows that he was asked to come on, he was showered with journalism awards, without that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=392.54s)]
*  lie it would have been much more difficult to convince Americans to support the war in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=395.82s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=399.7s)]
*  And needless to say, none of this has affected Jeffrey Goldberg's standing in corporate [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=400.7s)]
*  because as I've said before, it's not just tolerated, it's required if you want to advance [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=406.18s)]
*  in corporate media that you lie on behalf of the U.S. security state. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=410.42s)]
*  Nobody does that as eerily or as casually as Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=413.3s)]
*  But given that I agree with everything Pete Hegseth said about him, that provokes the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=418.1s)]
*  question why is it that Jeffrey Goldberg, that journalist that Pete Hegseth says is [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=422.62s)]
*  a fraudster and a hoaxster and spreads lies, why was he included in this very small, 16, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=427.66s)]
*  17 people, top national security officials, why was he included in this group? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=435.3s)]
*  And therefore made available, made aware of the war planning that took place. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=442.38000000000005s)]
*  Now it's true that not all of the details of the bombing operation in Yemen were included, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=447.70000000000005s)]
*  but a lot of it was. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=455.06s)]
*  Here is the Atlantic who actually was almost forced to reveal more tax because Jeffrey [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=456.86s)]
*  Goldberg had said there were details about the operation in here, the Trump administration [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=470.26s)]
*  vehemently denied it as you just heard Pete Hegseth do as others have done. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=474.54s)]
*  And because the Trump administration said there was nothing classified in there, Jeffrey [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=479.5s)]
*  Goldberg had no excuse to withhold it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=482.26s)]
*  The government itself, the Trump administration is saying this isn't classified. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=485.38s)]
*  So once you call the reporter a liar and claim that what he's claiming is in there really [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=489.53999999999996s)]
*  isn't and that there's nothing classified about it, you have no excuse not to publish [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=493.94s)]
*  it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=498.34s)]
*  You're basically duty bound to do so and he did. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=499.34s)]
*  Under this headline here are the attack plans that Trump's advisors shared on Signal. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=502.14s)]
*  The administration has downplayed the importance of the tax messages inadvertently sent to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=508.14s)]
*  the Atlantic's editor in chief and then here you can see the text itself. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=511.98s)]
*  At 1144 A.M. Eastern Time Hegseth posted in the chat in all caps, team update. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=519.02s)]
*  The text began this way, quote, time now, weather is favorable, just confirm with CENTCOM [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=527.78s)]
*  we are a go for mission launch. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=533.86s)]

*  And then the next set of chats, Hegseth continued. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=565.78s)]
*  1410 more F-18s launch second strike package. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=571.9s)]

*  This is when the first bombs will definitely drop pending earlier trigger based targets. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=579.5s)]
*  1536 F-18s second strike starts also first sea based tomahawks launched. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=584.54s)]
*  Word of follow per the timeline and then ironically in retrospect he added, we are currently [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=591.14s)]
*  clean on OPSEC, that is operational security. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=596.3s)]
*  So I'm sorry but nobody in good faith, nobody trying to be minimally honest, nobody who [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=601.18s)]
*  is anything other than a complete partisan hack would claim that there was nothing sensitive, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=609.54s)]

*  that the attack plan entails. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=635.22s)]
*  The US government classifies everything pretty much. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=640.86s)]
*  I've talked before about how I read through the Snowden archive for two years plus, hundreds [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=644.82s)]

*  Here's how you request a vacation, here's how you get a parking credential, top secret [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=659.7s)]
*  or classified. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=663.94s)]
*  The idea, the very idea that detailed war plans to secretly bomb a country is not information [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=664.94s)]
*  that ought to be closely held, that it's fine to share it with whomever is just an [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=674.7s)]
*  insult to your intelligence and it is a byproduct of the fact that Mike Waltz decided he won't [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=680.7s)]
*  tell the truth and couldn't tell the truth for reasons we'll get into so the administration [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=686.7s)]
*  lined up behind him to defend him and in doing so had to issue some claims that don't even [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=691.34s)]
*  pass the lab test. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=696.5s)]
*  Now I'm not pretending and I won't pretend that I'm sitting here worried about whether [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=699.14s)]
*  the government effectively or efficiently protects its secrets. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=705.24s)]
*  That is not my job. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=710.96s)]
*  I'm a journalist. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=711.96s)]
*  If anything my job is to unearth those secrets, not help the government, better hide them. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=712.96s)]
*  That's why I say I wouldn't even be talking about this if not for the fact that it's ongoing [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=718.98s)]
*  because the truth just wasn't admitted and instead we're getting an avalanche of preposterous [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=723.22s)]
*  claims and as I'll show you not just from the government but from Jeffrey Goldberg as well. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=728.2600000000001s)]
*  Here is a tweet from Caroline Levitt, the White House press secretary and she essentially [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=733.1400000000001s)]
*  followed up with the same sort of denials that Pete Hexeth, it's clearly part of the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=743.1400000000001s)]
*  strategy. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=747.94s)]
*  She says, quote, Jeffrey Goldberg is well known for his sensationalist spin. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=749.6600000000001s)]
*  Here are the facts about his latest story, quote, no war plans were discussed. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=753.94s)]
*  Come on, what I just showed you, are those war plans attack plans by any stretch of the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=758.98s)]
*  imagination, any way to interpret those phrases not to include that information I just cited? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=765.0200000000001s)]
*  And they're trying to claim that Jeffrey Goldberg one day said there were war plans and then [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=772.98s)]
*  the Atlantic were treated to attack plans. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=775.94s)]
*  There's no difference between those. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=777.9000000000001s)]
*  This is not true that, quote, no war planes were discussed in the signal chat. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=780.78s)]
*  Number two, no classified material was sent to this thread. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=784.78s)]
*  How is this information not classified? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=789.14s)]
*  Number three, the White House counsel's office has provided guidance on a number of different [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=792.48s)]
*  platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=796.1s)]
*  possible as the National Security Council stated the White House is looking into how [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=800.66s)]
*  Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=804.62s)]
*  Yeah, huge mystery. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=807.38s)]
*  Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump and everyone in this group, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=809.38s)]
*  the Houthi strikes were successful and effective, terrorists were killed, and that's what matters [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=813.34s)]
*  most to President Trump. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=816.86s)]
*  Trump administration officials for the last few months have been issuing very flamboyant [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=820.98s)]
*  and aggressive statements about the evils of leaking classified information, saying [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=824.14s)]
*  they have zero tolerance for it, they'll punish anybody who is responsible for it, and now [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  suddenly, because of Mike Waltz's careless mistake at best, they shared secret war plans, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=835.0600000000001s)]
*  secret attack and bombing plans with one of the most hostile anti-Trump media operatives [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=841.94s)]
*  on the planet, and now they resort to, oh, we don't care that much about leaking classified [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=846.9s)]
*  information, we just care that the operation was a success. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=851.94s)]
*  It was a success because Jeffrey Goldberg opted not to publish what he had learned prior [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  to the bombing campaign, but they had no way of guaranteeing that when they let him into [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=859.24s)]
*  that group. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=863.5s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, were [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=866.5s)]
*  testifying before Congress yesterday, and both of them took similar positions. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=870.74s)]
*  So I'm curious, did this conversation at some point include information on weapons packages, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=876.86s)]
*  targets, or timing? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=884.66s)]
*  Not that I'm aware of. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=887.76s)]
*  Okay, did you hear that? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=891.38s)]
*  I mean, whatever you think of the Yemen bombing campaign, however much you love President [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=894.06s)]
*  Trump, here's the CIA Director testifying before the Senate, and it's not even an effective [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=907.9399999999999s)]
*  lie because of course these chats were going to come out. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=917.02s)]
*  Was there anything about timing or weapons packages transmitted in this chat? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=919.98s)]
*  Obviously, John Ratcliffe, the CIA Director, read the chat. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=924.98s)]
*  It's right on his phone before going to testify. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=929.1800000000001s)]
*  He knew what was in there, and yet he still said, not to my knowledge or no. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=931.22s)]
*  I just read you exactly that, the weapons packages that were going to be used in the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=934.66s)]
*  timing of the attacks in detail. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=938.74s)]
*  What is the justification for lying about that? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=942.7s)]
*  Why would you even do that? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=945.16s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=946.9599999999999s)]
*  This began as a very trivial matter, and it's become something more significant because [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=947.9599999999999s)]
*  of the refusal to tell the truth and just dig in in defense of Mike Walz. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=952.4s)]
*  Here's the rest of this interrogation. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=956.56s)]
*  Director Gabbard, same question. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=959.8399999999999s)]
*  Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=963.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, those are two different answers, but you're saying that was not part of the conversation. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=967.68s)]
*  That's my knowledge. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=974.0799999999999s)]
*  Vice operational issues were not part of this conversation. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=975.32s)]
*  Correct. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=978.24s)]
*  I mean, maybe there is some way to kind of use some kind of a semantic aim to try and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=979.24s)]
*  justify those answers, but they are misleading at best. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=995.9200000000001s)]
*  They should have just said, yes, as we were talking about the operation, we did talk about [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1000.72s)]
*  timing. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1004.88s)]
*  It was a mistake to include a journalist and period. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1005.88s)]
*  End of story. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1008.04s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1009.04s)]
*  It was careless. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1010.04s)]
*  We have to take steps to make sure it would not happen again. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1011.04s)]
*  That would have ended the whole thing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1013.32s)]
*  Mike Walz went on Laura Ingraham last night, and I just want to give you this sense for [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1017.04s)]
*  how preposterous this has now become, how insulting so many of these explanations are. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1022.6s)]
*  Laura Ingraham, to her credit, wanted to know how it is that Jeffrey Goldberg's phone number [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1030.48s)]
*  ended up saved in Mike Walz's phone and why that happened. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1039.68s)]
*  Now, I don't know how many of you have used Signal before, but when you open the Signal [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1043.0400000000002s)]
*  app, the only people with whom you can start communicating are people who are saved in [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1049.64s)]
*  your phone. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1056.64s)]
*  You have to have somebody saved in your phone in order to send them a message. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1058.36s)]
*  You can't just type a random number in. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1063.56s)]
*  And then if you create a new Signal group that permits you to speak with multiple Signal [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  users at once, you have to add, click add people to your group, and the only options [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1072.24s)]
*  that you have are people whose contacts are saved in your phone. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1079.7s)]
*  If you want to add somebody whose contact is not saved in your phone, you have to first [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1083.2s)]
*  save their contact in your phone. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1087.28s)]
*  That's the only way you can add them to a Signal group. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1088.96s)]
*  I understand why Mike Walz doesn't want to admit that he had Jeffrey Goldberg's number [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  saved in his phone. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1099.16s)]
*  Because Jeffrey Goldberg is one of the most dishonest and one of the most vehemently anti-Trump [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1102.0s)]
*  media people in all of Washington, and Trump, Mike Walz's boss, harbors a severe hatred [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1108.3999999999999s)]
*  for Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1113.84s)]
*  As you saw with Pete Hegseth, Trump has said similar things. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1115.0s)]
*  They hate Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1117.92s)]
*  And if they know that Mike Walz is chatting with Jeffrey Goldberg or has his contact information [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1120.2s)]
*  saved in his phone, and why would you have that saved in your phone if you weren't actually [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1124.16s)]
*  chatting with him, that would be something that would trigger Donald Trump's rage. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1128.6s)]
*  You have Jeffrey Goldberg, you talk to Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1134.08s)]
*  And so instead of just admitting that this is what happened, he was too scared to admit [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1137.68s)]
*  that he had Jeffrey Goldberg's phone number saved in his phone. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1142.8799999999999s)]
*  To Laura Ingraham's credit, and I'm not surprised at all that she did it, she's done it many [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1147.36s)]
*  times before, she quite persistently and adversely questioned Mike Walz on this very question. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1152.04s)]
*  I want you to listen to the utter babbling, the preposterous defense, the attempts to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1160.04s)]
*  justify how this could have happened that came out of Mike Walz's mouth. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1167.6399999999999s)]
*  Remember, this is the national security advisor, the person closest to the president on matters [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1170.36s)]
*  of national security, somebody responsible for possessing and analyzing and safeguarding [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1175.1999999999998s)]
*  the most sensitive secrets that our government possesses. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1180.76s)]
*  Here's his attempt to explain away how we had Jeffrey Goldberg's number in his phone. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1183.84s)]
*  And I know him in the sense that he hates the president, but I don't text him, he wasn't [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1187.76s)]
*  on my phone, and we're going to figure out how this happened. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1192.24s)]
*  So you don't know what staffer is responsible for this right now? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1194.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, look, a staffer wasn't responsible, and look, I take full responsibility. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1198.28s)]
*  I built the group. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1202.8s)]
*  My job is to make sure everything's coordinated. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1204.9199999999998s)]
*  But how did the number... [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1207.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't mean to be pedantic here, but how did the number get in the chat? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1208.0s)]
*  Have you ever had somebody's contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else's number there? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1210.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, I never make those mistakes. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1216.0s)]
*  You've got somebody else's number on someone else's contact. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1217.1999999999998s)]
*  So of course I didn't see this loser in the group. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1220.96s)]
*  It looked like someone else. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1223.6s)]
*  Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean is something [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1224.84s)]
*  we're trying to figure out. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1229.4399999999998s)]
*  So a staffer did not put his contact information? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1230.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1235.1999999999998s)]
*  But how did it end up in your phone? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1236.1999999999998s)]
*  That's what we're trying to figure out. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1237.1999999999998s)]
*  But that's a pretty big problem. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1239.9599999999998s)]
*  That is what we've got in the best technical minds, right? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1241.1999999999998s)]
*  And that's where, I mean, I'm sure everybody out there has had a contact where it was said [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  one person and then a different phone number. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1250.9399999999998s)]
*  But you've never talked to him before. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1253.1999999999998s)]
*  So how's the number on your phone? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1254.6s)]
*  I mean, I'm not an expert on any of this, but it's just curious. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1255.6s)]
*  How's the number on your phone? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1257.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, if you have somebody else's contact and then somehow it gets sucked in. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, someone sent you that contact. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1263.4399999999998s)]
*  Was there someone else supposed to be on the chat that wasn't on the chat that you thought [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  was on the chat? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1268.56s)]
*  So the person that I thought was on there was never on there. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1269.56s)]
*  It was this guy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1272.52s)]
*  Who was that person supposed to be? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1273.52s)]
*  Well, I'm not. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1274.52s)]
*  Look, Laura, I take responsibility. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1275.52s)]
*  I built the group. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1277.6799999999998s)]
*  So that's the part that we have to figure out. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1279.76s)]
*  Oh, we have to convene all of the greatest technological minds and the scientists and [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1284.72s)]
*  the computer experts and security experts from all around the world to investigate how [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1291.68s)]
*  it possibly could be the case that Jeffrey Goldberg's contact information and phone number [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1296.92s)]
*  was stored in Mike Waltz's phone, sufficient to allow Mike Waltz to put him into the signal [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1303.76s)]
*  group. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1309.48s)]
*  And when Laura Ingraham said to him, what do you mean? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1311.72s)]
*  How did the number get saved in your phone if you never talked to Mike? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1316.04s)]
*  How did it get saved there? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1318.74s)]
*  He's like, oh, well, what happens is I'm sure you had this experience. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1320.96s)]
*  It's like sometimes this contact you have saved has a totally different number of a [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1324.6s)]
*  different, has that ever happened to you? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1330.58s)]
*  But then she still said, okay, given that's the case, Jeffrey Goldberg's phone number [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1333.06s)]
*  in contact information ended up in your phone. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1338.3200000000002s)]
*  And it was identified as Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1343.0800000000002s)]
*  The graphic in the signal chat said JG, which is Jeffrey Goldberg's initials. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1344.76s)]
*  And he said, oh, yeah, yeah, what happens is like when this happens, the number gets [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1351.3600000000001s)]
*  sucked in. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1355.1200000000001s)]
*  It gets sucked in. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  It's totally what happens. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1359.0s)]
*  Like the iPhone, like, oh, yeah, so many times, you know, there are these people who I don't [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1360.0s)]
*  want to talk to, who I don't, I'm not supposed to talk to. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1364.24s)]
*  But my iPhone just sucks in their contact information and their name. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1367.44s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, my God, how did they get in my contacts? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1370.48s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1372.72s)]
*  How do I have their phone number and their name in my, oh, yeah, the phone sucked it [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1373.72s)]
*  in. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1378.2s)]
*  Like sucked it in from where? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1379.2s)]
*  It's laughable. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1381.64s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1383.64s)]
*  It's insulting that they would continue this preposterous charade. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1385.74s)]
*  From the beginning, Mike Waltz says he doesn't know who Jeffrey Goldberg is. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1394.68s)]
*  He's never talked to Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1397.2s)]
*  Oh, by the way, here is another image that the Atlantic released today. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1398.52s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, in his original story, said that he was added to the chat group that he [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1404.3600000000001s)]
*  got an invitation and added to the chat group by Mike Waltz. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1409.64s)]
*  And just for, again, for those of you who don't use Signal, if somebody who has your [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1412.04s)]
*  contact information stored in their phone, which again is a prerequisite to adding you [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1417.64s)]
*  to a Signal group, tries to put you into the Signal group, Signal will send you a message [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1420.8400000000001s)]
*  saying, this person, Mike Waltz, has added you, wants to add you to a Signal group. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1425.8000000000002s)]
*  Do you accept or do you reject? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1431.4s)]
*  And then once you hit accept, you become part of the group. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  And the group messages, Signal messages to the entire group that the person who added [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1437.0800000000002s)]
*  you is the person who was added by somebody else. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1443.64s)]
*  So here you see, this is the Huthy PC small group. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1451.16s)]
*  And let's pull up the highlighter just to show you here. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1455.1200000000001s)]
*  So here's what it says. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1462.28s)]
*  It says, Mike Waltz added you to the group. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1464.1200000000001s)]
*  This is Jeffrey Goldberg's phone. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1468.4s)]
*  There were only 19 members. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1470.1200000000001s)]
*  It was intended to be a small group talking about the Huthy operation. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  And there the first message is Mike Waltz says, team, establishing a principles group [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1477.6s)]
*  for coordination on Huthys, particularly over the next 72 hours. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1481.04s)]
*  My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a Tiger team at deputy's agency chief of staff [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1484.7199999999998s)]
*  level following up from the meeting. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1489.36s)]
*  Now I heard a lot of Trump supporters trying to claim, to pin the blame on his assistant [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1491.1999999999998s)]
*  or his staffer Alex Wong. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1495.7199999999998s)]
*  Mike Waltz is willing to say anything to defend himself. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1500.24s)]
*  You just saw that. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1502.6s)]
*  But he's not willing to falsely blame Alex Wong. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1503.6s)]
*  Anyway, if you're the national security advisor, would you be handing out your phone, your [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1507.72s)]
*  personal telephone to staffers and they have just access to it? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1510.76s)]
*  They can go in and like delete contacts, add contacts, access all your personal information. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1514.8400000000001s)]
*  That's not something a national security advisor should be doing. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1520.28s)]
*  If that were the explanation, that might even be worse, more reckless. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1523.2s)]
*  But that's not what happened. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1526.8000000000002s)]
*  It says right here, Mike Waltz added Jeffrey Goldberg to the group. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1528.64s)]
*  And again, the only way you could do that is if you have Jeffrey Goldberg's number saved [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1532.0s)]
*  in your phone. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1535.52s)]
*  Mike Waltz has been insisting from the beginning, I don't know Jeffrey Goldberg, I've never [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  met him, I've never talked to him. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1540.04s)]
*  Here is a photo from October 2021 that people dug up. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1542.12s)]
*  It's from the French philosopher and war monger Bernard Henri Levy. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1550.24s)]
*  And on October 29th, 2021, he tweeted, launch of the will to see. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1556.68s)]
*  Thanks Ambassador 18, thanks for being there. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1561.84s)]
*  And then he goes to the people who were in this, you can see this small group of people, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1564.52s)]
*  it's about seven people. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1569.36s)]
*  Al Anarzi, Bayan Rahman, Jeffrey Goldberg, David Tafari, Michael Waltz, Sinan 56, Tom [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1571.44s)]
*  Kaplan, Emily Hilton. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  And you see here, this is Mike Waltz and Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1585.28s)]
*  They are standing right next to each other. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1589.08s)]
*  Now, I don't know, maybe you stood next to somebody on a stage before and even though [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1595.12s)]
*  you work in exactly the same area, Jeffrey Goldberg is a national security reporter, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1600.56s)]
*  Mike Waltz is a member of Congress, works in national security, who is very well known [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1604.04s)]
*  in DC, has been around forever. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1609.0s)]
*  There you see the two of them and up close. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1610.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe you actually just didn't talk to him, you never remembered this, it's a total coincidence [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1614.52s)]
*  that the person whose contact and number is saved in your phone is somebody that you were [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1620.56s)]
*  about three inches from in a small group meeting on a stage. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1624.8s)]
*  Here is a news story. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1633.56s)]
*  Mexico extradites 29 drug traffickers to the US to avoid trade tariffs. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1634.56s)]
*  We all know how deceptive mainstream media can be, they push agendas, sense of voices [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1640.04s)]
*  and make sure that you only see one side of the story. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1643.92s)]
*  That's exactly why I started this show here in Rumble, because I believe in free speech [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1647.0800000000002s)]
*  and real conversations and reporting that entails all sides and ultimately the best [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1650.72s)]
*  pursuit of the truth possible. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1655.3999999999999s)]
*  It's why I partnered with an app and website that believes in all of those values too. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1656.96s)]
*  Ground News prioritizes free speech, over controlling the narrative. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1661.12s)]
*  For every news story you can find all the articles reporting on it worldwide with context [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1665.32s)]
*  such as if a news source has any political bias, how credible they are and if any major [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1670.52s)]
*  corporation is influencing their reporting. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1674.76s)]
*  All I have to do is swipe through coverage with tags indicating if it's coming from a [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1677.8400000000001s)]
*  liberal or conservative source or from corporate or independent voices and from there I can [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1680.8400000000001s)]
*  decide for myself if Mexico's unprecedented extradition of 29 cartel members to the US [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1685.3600000000001s)]
*  is proof that Trump's tariff tactics are really working like some conservative sources report [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  or if it's just a routine legal process and one of the cartel members pled not guilty [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1697.08s)]
*  anyway like the center and the left are saying. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1701.16s)]
*  If I had just read one of those sources I'd have a completely skewed view of reality but [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1704.3200000000002s)]
*  with Ground News I could put them side by side and decide for myself who's actually [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1709.44s)]
*  telling the truth. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1713.76s)]
*  Ground News even created a dedicated feed called Blind Spot that exposes stories that [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1714.76s)]
*  neither side of the political spectrum is reporting on making it impossible, or rather [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1720.0800000000002s)]
*  making it possible to spot stories that people in charge don't want you to see. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1724.72s)]
*  Ground News is bringing back transparency in the news and civil discourse right from [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8xP4Cw2I4&t=1728.68s)]
