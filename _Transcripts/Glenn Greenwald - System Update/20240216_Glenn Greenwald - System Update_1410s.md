# Industrialized Factory Farms Threaten Humans & Animals Alike: Exposing the Multi-Layered Atrocities
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8)
*  It's often the case that people talk about journalism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=0.0s)]
*  They criticize journalism. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=9.72s)]
*  They talk about the importance of journalism. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  They argue about who is a journalist and who's not, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=12.84s)]
*  what is good journalism and bad journalism. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And yet it's very rare for anyone to take a step back and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=17.84s)]
*  define what that means, what journalism means. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=20.64s)]
*  What it means to me, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=24.76s)]
*  at least in terms of political journalists, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=26.72s)]
*  there's a lot of different kinds of journalists. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=28.8s)]
*  You can have cultural journalists and critics and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  all sorts of other things. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=33.8s)]
*  But for political journalism, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=34.68s)]
*  what journalism means to me is a focus on the most powerful [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=36.64s)]
*  institutional actors in society or the most powerful and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=41.88s)]
*  influential individuals and to not glorify them or [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=45.6s)]
*  offer to serve as propagandists to promote them, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  but instead to subject them to journalistic scrutiny, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  to assess the truth of what they're saying and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=57.16s)]
*  not just to assess it, but to investigate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  And then ultimately try to reveal to the public what the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=63.0s)]
*  public ought to know that these industries and institutions [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  are hiding so that the public can make up their own mind [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  about what they think of those institutions now that they're [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=73.2s)]
*  fully informed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=76.4s)]
*  Journalism does not mean telling somebody what to think or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=78.16s)]
*  trying to lead them to a conclusion, but it does mean [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=81.2s)]
*  doing your best to expose the secrets, to pulling out the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  curtain so that you can see what is taking place there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=87.24s)]
*  That's what we do with powerful institutions like the US [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=91.36s)]
*  Security State and the Pentagon and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=94.12s)]
*  the Military Industrial Complex and the media corporations [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=96.4s)]
*  that try and influence and propagandize Americans and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=101.12s)]
*  the institutions behind the censorship industrial complex. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=103.92s)]
*  And among the most powerful institutions are the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  institutions, the corporations that compose the factory [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=111.32s)]
*  farming industry in the United States. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  They are responsible for almost all of our food supply. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=117.0s)]
*  They employ hundreds of thousands of workers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=120.52s)]
*  They finance the campaigns of both political parties. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=122.92s)]
*  They exert massive influence, both in Washington and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  in the legislative houses of state governments. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=131.8s)]
*  And they have impact and influence in almost every aspect [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=135.48s)]
*  of our lives, including the law and politics and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=139.56s)]
*  now our free speech rights. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=143.12s)]
*  And so focusing on this industry, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=145.56s)]
*  it's something I've done throughout my journalism career [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=148.32s)]
*  that I don't think we've done a devoted show to this topic. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=150.24s)]
*  We thought this was a good week when I was traveling to do so, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=154.16s)]
*  to take a step back and ask you to pay attention and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  kind of be interested in this because of the impact that it [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=160.6s)]
*  has, regardless of what you end up concluding, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=163.8s)]
*  was something very important to do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=166.44s)]
*  And it's particularly important because of how [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=168.68s)]
*  devoted these corporations have become to keeping the truth [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=172.04s)]
*  from you, to actually trying to enact laws, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=176.32s)]
*  using their influence over various lawmakers to make it [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=179.64s)]
*  illegal for activists and journalists to expose what it is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=184.16s)]
*  that they do and to show you the truth about what takes place [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=187.96s)]
*  inside of these factory farms. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=190.72s)]
*  Here from Forbes in May of 2016, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=193.08s)]
*  and there are countless articles like this, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=196.4s)]
*  the headline, big agriculture bullies and lobbies [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=198.44s)]
*  to keep Americans in the dark. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=202.16s)]
*  Anytime powerful institutions are working to keep you in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  dark, you should want to turn on the lights or have [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=207.44s)]
*  journalists do their job and turn them on for you so that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  you can see what's going on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=213.6s)]
*  From quashing free speech to lobbying for laws that would [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=215.92s)]
*  allow it to hide what it doesn't want the public to see, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=219.0s)]
*  big agriculture has perfected strategies for keeping [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  consumers uninformed and for covering its unsavory tracks. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  When undercover advocates released a number of videos [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  showing animal abuse on industrial farms and in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=233.68s)]
*  slaughtering facilities, big agriculture barely blanked. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=236.52s)]
*  Instead of being outraged at appalling living conditions, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  food safety concerns or animal torture, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=243.4s)]
*  big ag chose to lobby for state quote ag gag legislation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  Laws that would punish those who record and distribute images [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=251.12s)]
*  of horrifying conditions at animal agricultural facilities [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=255.24s)]
*  without the owner's consent. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=259.04s)]
*  Big ag has convinced house Republicans to include language [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=261.8s)]
*  in the proposed 2017 house agricultural appropriations bill [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=265.04s)]
*  that would exempt agricultural commodity groups from [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  freedom of information act requests. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=271.6s)]
*  Last year's fiasco at the American egg board likely [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=274.12s)]
*  precipitated big ag's efforts to get checkoff programs [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  exempted from FOIA law. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=280.48s)]
*  Emails obtained through a FOIA request show that egg board [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=282.56s)]
*  leaders had tried to undermine an egg free mayonnaise [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=285.32000000000005s)]
*  competitor, Just Mayo. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=288.48s)]
*  According to the emails, the egg board worked with a public [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  relations agency to try to slow Just Mayo's growth [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=292.92s)]
*  and at one point directed a consultant to call Whole Foods [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  to ask that they keep Just Mayo off of their shelves. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=299.36s)]
*  I've asked that bother you no matter what your views are [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  on any of this, that they are trying to create a legal [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=306.6s)]
*  framework where it is a crime to video or photograph [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  what is taking place inside of those facilities [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  to show the public if you don't have their permission [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=318.44s)]
*  to do so. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=321.4s)]
*  It's a direct violation of free speech and free press laws [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=323.4s)]
*  and fortunately courts have finally begun to rule that way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=326.28s)]
*  Here from a release from Harvard University [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=330.12s)]
*  by Joseph William Singer in February of 2023 is a report [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=332.55999999999995s)]
*  on just one of those court rulings, quote, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  the fourth circuit strikes down North Carolina's ag ag law [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=338.76s)]
*  under the first amendment. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=342.32s)]
*  Quote, in a very complicated ruling, the fourth circuit [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=344.16s)]
*  has struck down North Carolina's ag ag law [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=347.08s)]
*  that prohibited employees from engaging in quote, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=349.56s)]
*  undercover animal cruelty investigations [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=352.04s)]
*  and publicizing what they uncover on the grounds [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=354.64s)]
*  that it violates the first amendment free speech rights. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=357.68s)]
*  The North Carolina Property Protection Act prohibits quote, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=361.04s)]
*  intentionally gaining access to the non-public areas [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=364.2s)]
*  of another's premises and engaging in an act [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=368.12s)]
*  that exceeds this person's authority to enter. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  The court suggests that North Carolina can achieve [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=374.68s)]
*  any legitimate goals it has in protecting private property [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=376.88s)]
*  by focusing on the interest of trespass laws [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=379.96s)]
*  that protect the exclusive use of land [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=382.92s)]
*  but unauthorized access can be prohibited [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  that cannot be conditioned on regulating speech [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=387.72s)]
*  that is protected by the first amendment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=390.48s)]
*  So much of what we learned has been through [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=393.6s)]
*  unauthorized reporting about the government. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=395.6s)]
*  Snowden was unauthorized to take the evidence [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=399.12s)]
*  that proved that the NSA was illegally [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  and unconstitutionally spying on Americans without warrants. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=405.32s)]
*  WikiLeaks publishes unauthorized information. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=408.72s)]
*  It's what journalists do. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=411.8s)]
*  Of course corporations don't want anyone reporting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=413.44s)]
*  on the truth of what they're doing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=416.36s)]
*  They want to rely on propaganda and commercials [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=417.52s)]
*  and all sorts of fake branding to convince you [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=421.36s)]
*  that something, that they're doing something [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  that they are not in fact doing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=427.72s)]
*  And the reason why they are so eager to hide this [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=430.32s)]
*  is because there is now a growing group of people, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=433.04s)]
*  activists and journalists who understand [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  that what is taking place inside these facilities [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=439.08s)]
*  is a moral atrocity and a threat to the public health [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  and devastating in so many other ways. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  And it can't be hidden any longer [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  because it affects all of you. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=451.52s)]
*  It affects all of us. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  So one of the innovative ways [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=455.84s)]
*  that animal rights groups and animal welfare groups [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=457.64s)]
*  have developed for showing the reality [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=460.92s)]
*  is by using virtual reality technology [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=463.44s)]
*  to film inside of the factory farm [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=465.52s)]
*  so that you can see what it's actually like, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=468.6s)]
*  the horrors and torture that is taking place there. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=471.6s)]
*  Here from the New York Times in July of 2017, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=475.76s)]
*  you see the headline, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=479.08s)]
*  Animal Welfare Groups Have a New Tool, Virtual Reality. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=479.92s)]
*  Quote, for years animal rights advocates [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=484.0s)]
*  trying to expose bad practices in the meat industry [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=486.04s)]
*  have surreptitiously shot grainy photographs [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  and handheld video. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  Now they have a more sophisticated weapon in the arsenal, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=493.76000000000005s)]
*  the virtual reality camera. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=496.24s)]
*  Wayne Swung, the founder of Direct Action Everywhere [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=498.56s)]
*  who will be our guest in just a little bit, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=501.36s)]
*  which also fights for animal welfare [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=503.56s)]
*  called the technology, quote, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=505.24s)]
*  a game changer for animal advocates. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  Quote, the meat industry always complains [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=509.16s)]
*  that we're using selective footage, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  narrow vantage points and editing [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=512.96s)]
*  to make things seem worse, he said, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  but with virtual reality, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=517.4s)]
*  you're seeing exactly what we saw [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=518.52s)]
*  and are hearing exactly what we heard. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  In one sign of how quickly the technology is being adopted, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=522.68s)]
*  among animal advocacy groups, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=525.88s)]
*  Direct Action also released a virtual reality video [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=527.48s)]
*  on Thursday. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  It takes viewers into the barns [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=531.48s)]
*  that circle four farms in Milford, Utah, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=533.4s)]
*  one of the largest pig production operations [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=537.56s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=539.8s)]
*  The film shows sores with bloody and mangled teats, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  pregnant cells with gnawing on the bars [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=544.8s)]
*  of the narrow stalls that they live in [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=546.96s)]
*  until they give birth [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=548.6s)]
*  and piglets clamoring over and nibbling dead siblings. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=550.16s)]
*  In a portion of the film, Mr. Swung narrates, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=554.28s)]
*  dead piglets are piled up behind a sow [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=557.08s)]
*  who was wedged into a crate so tightly [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=559.4s)]
*  that she cannot move away from the mess. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=562.36s)]
*  But a viewer can turn away from her to see and hear sows [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=565.24s)]
*  in similar straights all around her. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=568.28s)]
*  Circle four is owned by Smithfield Foods, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=571.72s)]
*  which was bought in 2013 by Shanghai International, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=574.16s)]
*  one of China's largest meat processors. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=578.36s)]
*  Kira Lombardo, a Smithfield spokeswoman, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=581.16s)]
*  said the video had, quote, blatant inaccuracies, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=583.88s)]
*  such as his assertions that the animals shown in it [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  are being starved. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=589.52s)]
*  Now we're gonna get back to the issue of pigs [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=593.28s)]
*  in just a second. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  Pigs are at least as intelligent as dogs are. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=597.04s)]
*  Morso, most have show. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=601.92s)]
*  They are as socially complex [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=604.5999999999999s)]
*  and emotionally developed as dogs are. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=607.8399999999999s)]
*  They're extremely social animals. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=611.5999999999999s)]
*  But in these factory farms, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=614.1999999999999s)]
*  mother pigs are taken into a cage so tiny and narrow [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  that they can't move, they cannot turn around, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=620.4799999999999s)]
*  and they're kept there for a year or longer. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=622.4s)]
*  And they go insane because, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=626.04s)]
*  just like if you put human beings in solitary confinement [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=627.9599999999999s)]
*  because we are social animals, we will go insane. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=630.56s)]
*  John McCain famously said that far worse [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  than the physical abuse he suffered [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=636.92s)]
*  while detained by the North Koreans [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=638.3599999999999s)]
*  was the isolation that he was kept in. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=639.88s)]
*  There's all kinds of studies about how prolonged isolation [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=643.4s)]
*  drives humans insane, it drives pigs insane as well. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=646.5999999999999s)]
*  And you go into any of these factory farms [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=649.68s)]
*  and these pigs are so desperate to get out [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=651.2399999999999s)]
*  from these tiny little crates they're kept in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=655.56s)]
*  that they start gnawing on the metal rods [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=658.04s)]
*  until their teeth fall out and their mouths are full of blood. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=661.24s)]
*  They often just almost kill themselves [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=663.48s)]
*  by throwing themselves against the metal barriers [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=665.16s)]
*  until all their organs are scrambled. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  It's one of the most horrible things you will ever look at, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=671.76s)]
*  especially given the capacity for thought and complexity [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=676.6s)]
*  and intelligence and social connection [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=681.48s)]
*  that pigs were born to fulfill. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=683.56s)]
*  But what really is the most defining attribute [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=686.88s)]
*  of these factory farms is the utter [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=691.64s)]
*  and complete dehumanization, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=693.68s)]
*  the need to absolutely cut off any sense of empathy [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  that people have for animals. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=700.08s)]
*  It's very common, it's a kind of cliche, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=701.56s)]
*  but it's absolutely true that a lot of people [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=703.48s)]
*  who grow up to be serial killers or sociopaths [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=705.68s)]
*  or psychopaths begin by torturing small animals, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=708.92s)]
*  things that most people can't do [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=712.84s)]
*  because our natural empathy for animals [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=714.28s)]
*  doesn't prevent us from doing so, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=717.52s)]
*  it doesn't permit us from doing so. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=719.5600000000001s)]
*  Sociopaths and psychopaths have no empathy [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=721.48s)]
*  and people trained to work in these factory farms [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  are trained, almost like people in the military [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=726.8s)]
*  are trained not to see the humanity of those they have to kill [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=729.12s)]
*  to cut off that empathy to suppress it [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=732.44s)]
*  so that they can do unimaginable cruelty to animals. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=736.16s)]
*  One of the things that is very common in egg farms [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=739.52s)]
*  is that hens that are bred to lay eggs [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=743.92s)]
*  are bred not to be eaten but just to lay eggs. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=748.84s)]
*  And as a result, the only chicks that have any value [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=752.76s)]
*  are female chicks because they keep those to lay the eggs. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=758.04s)]
*  The male chicks have zero economic value to egg farms [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=760.84s)]
*  because they can't lay eggs [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=768.84s)]
*  and because they don't grow into the kinds of roosters [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=770.28s)]
*  that can be consumed as chickens, as food, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  because their body doesn't support the muscles [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=777.12s)]
*  so they have zero economic value. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=780.12s)]
*  And so what happens is when hens lay eggs [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=782.48s)]
*  and these chicks are born and are hatched, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=785.48s)]
*  by the thousands, they are culled, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=789.0s)]
*  meaning that on a conveyor belt, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=791.2s)]
*  huge numbers of chicks are sent down this assembly line [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=793.4s)]
*  and workers who are trained to identify their gender [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=798.2s)]
*  take out the male chicks on the first day of life. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=801.44s)]
*  This is right when they're born [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=805.44s)]
*  and they instantly mass kill them, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  either by throwing them into a container [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=810.84s)]
*  that kills them with carbon dioxide [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=813.84s)]
*  or more commonly, just throwing them into a incinerator, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=815.7600000000001s)]
*  something that just cuts their body until they're dead. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=819.8000000000001s)]
*  And there's huge mountains of dead male chicks, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=823.32s)]
*  not even the day old, who then get dumped into [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=827.2s)]
*  sewage, into communities, into water supplies. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=832.28s)]
*  It is revolting. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=834.76s)]
*  Here's a video from Animals Australia [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=835.72s)]
*  that shows you the process of March of 2023. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=838.08s)]
*  The other process sees workers sorting [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  and separating male chicks from the females [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=844.84s)]
*  on a conveyor belt. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=847.24s)]
*  The vulnerable baby chicks bounce off each other [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=849.12s)]
*  and the rails in this mechanized system. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=851.64s)]
*  Finally, one by one, they drop off the belt, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=855.44s)]
*  their lives are ended, and bodies shredded [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  by a metal grinder. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  All right, so there are workers who wake up every day [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  and they go to work and their job is to pick out [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=871.7600000000001s)]
*  male chicks that are about an hour old [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=875.5600000000001s)]
*  and to throw them into a metal grinder [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=878.8800000000001s)]
*  that chops up their body and kills them, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=880.44s)]
*  by the billions, by the billions. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=882.44s)]
*  What it's doing is these are creatures [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=887.0s)]
*  that are born as part of whatever you believe in, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=889.48s)]
*  by God, by nature, by the universe, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=891.4s)]
*  and they are bred to be instantly slaughtered [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=896.36s)]
*  by the billions. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=900.12s)]
*  Here is a separate procedure that is used for chicks. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=902.48s)]
*  It's called de-beaking because it's much easier [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=908.48s)]
*  to raise them if they don't have their beaks [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  so that they can't peck at or attack other hens. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=913.44s)]
*  The de-beaking that gets done by the thousands every day [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=919.04s)]
*  where they just cut off their beak with no painkillers, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=922.88s)]
*  no anesthesia, they obviously suffer greatly. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  What it shows is just the complete humanity [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=927.92s)]
*  that has been stripped from this process. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=931.16s)]
*  It is just purely industrialized, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  treating them like widgets at a factory, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=935.3199999999999s)]
*  even though these are living sentient beings [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=937.8399999999999s)]
*  who feel pain, who feel everything [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=939.88s)]
*  that highly developed animals feel. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=942.0s)]
*  Take a look at this, and I think it really vividly [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=945.36s)]
*  illustrates the mentality behind it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=948.4s)]
*  ["Sad Music"] [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=952.44s)]
*  Now, some of these are activist videos, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=959.16s)]
*  so you can ignore the sad music [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=960.96s)]
*  and just analyze it yourself. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=962.6s)]
*  I know that most people look at this [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=965.5600000000001s)]
*  and don't want to see it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=966.96s)]
*  They feel bad about it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=967.92s)]
*  They feel sadness and empathetic to these animals. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=968.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=973.52s)]
*  Because it's so natural, we should be conditioned [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=974.36s)]
*  to be completely indifferent. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=977.04s)]
*  Should be able to look at these videos all day [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=979.52s)]
*  and not feel the slightest thing. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=980.96s)]
*  Here is a undercover film at Smithfield Foods [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=984.44s)]
*  that shows, and this is from 2010, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=989.36s)]
*  the way in which the pigs are kept in these crates [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=993.72s)]
*  that are so tiny they literally cannot stand up [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=999.48s)]
*  and turn around. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1003.08s)]
*  They just sit there by themselves, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1003.9200000000001s)]
*  looking straight forward for years on end. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1005.44s)]
*  ["Sad Music"] [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1009.76s)]
*  So those are the gestation crates, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1027.0s)]
*  and you see here one pig after the next, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1029.48s)]
*  and this goes on for miles. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1031.04s)]
*  These are huge, gigantic factories, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1033.04s)]
*  and each one of these is a pig kept in a cage [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1036.04s)]
*  that is about the same size as the width of their body [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  so they can't turn around. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1044.6399999999999s)]
*  Talk about hundreds of thousands [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1046.8s)]
*  and millions of them every day being kept this way. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1049.0s)]

*  We've found our extraordinarily inhumane conditions [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1059.74s)]
*  at Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1062.5800000000002s)]
*  in the entire world. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1065.2600000000002s)]
*  I still remember the first time I ever laid eyes [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1068.66s)]
*  on a gestation crate festility. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1071.5400000000002s)]
*  Seeing the helplessness of these animals [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1074.1000000000001s)]
*  who have done nothing to deserve the fate [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1077.2600000000002s)]
*  that they're enduring, suffering inside of these crates, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1079.42s)]
*  is just absolutely devastating. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1082.94s)]
*  The German Society of the United States [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1086.22s)]
*  has investigated one of Smithfield's breeding operations. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1089.2600000000002s)]
*  This facility represents what gestation crate confinement is. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1103.0200000000002s)]
*  Open wounds, pressure sores, infections, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1107.6200000000001s)]
*  bleeding gums from biting the bars so much, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1113.42s)]
*  and these animals aren't even being cared for [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1115.94s)]
*  with individualized veterinary attention. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1117.78s)]
*  Regardless of how the system is managed, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1121.54s)]
*  these pigs are barely able to move [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1123.74s)]
*  even an inch their entire lives. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1125.6200000000001s)]
*  They're unable to walk around, to turn around. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1127.9s)]
*  It causes them to quite literally go insane. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1130.14s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why so many animal scientists [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1137.18s)]
*  and veterinarians have condemned [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1140.18s)]
*  this extreme confinement practice. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1141.74s)]
*  Smithfield, about, I would say, two weeks ago, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1151.78s)]
*  two, three weeks ago, made an announcement [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1154.66s)]
*  that we had made a decision to phase out [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1156.6200000000001s)]
*  the use of the salgistration crates [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1158.78s)]
*  in all of our company owned farms. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1162.02s)]
*  So that's from 2007, this video is 2010. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1163.8200000000002s)]
*  Here's a Smithfield executive [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1166.98s)]
*  claiming that they made a decision [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1169.3799999999999s)]
*  to phase out gestation crates. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1170.86s)]
*  They've been doing this for many, many years [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1172.82s)]
*  because, again, these are not vegans objecting [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1175.4199999999998s)]
*  or vegetarians objecting. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1178.98s)]
*  These are meat eaters who believe in the justice [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1180.1799999999998s)]
*  of killing animals for food. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1183.22s)]
*  Many of them do, and yet, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1184.98s)]
*  that doesn't mean they endorse industrialized mass torture [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1187.3s)]
*  that causes these sentient animals to go completely insane. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1192.02s)]
*  Over a 10-year period. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1196.58s)]
*  Smithfield committed publicly [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1198.74s)]
*  to phasing out gestation crates within a 10-year period, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1200.78s)]
*  receiving a lot of public praise for doing so. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1204.18s)]
*  Now, just a couple years later, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1206.98s)]
*  the company is saying that it no longer can meet [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1208.58s)]
*  its own very generous self-imposed deadline. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1211.02s)]
*  That's completely unacceptable. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1214.3s)]
*  Many other pork companies, such as, let's say, Maxwell Foods, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1218.94s)]
*  which is one of the biggest pork producers in the country, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1221.78s)]
*  is already 100% gestation crate-free. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1224.22s)]
*  Cargill and other major pork producers [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1227.3s)]
*  are already 50% gestation crate-free. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1229.1s)]
*  The American Farm Bureau, the primary agribusiness lobby [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1233.94s)]
*  in the United States, funded a poll in which they found [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1236.74s)]
*  that an overwhelming majority of Americans [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1239.1s)]
*  find gestation crates to be inhumane. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1241.46s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why seven states in the country [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1244.26s)]
*  have already banned this practice, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1246.78s)]
*  why all 27 member nations of the EU have banned the practice. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1248.62s)]
*  Gestation crates are a practice of the past, not of the future, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1253.78s)]
*  and Smithfield ought to be speeding up that trend [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1257.46s)]
*  rather than slowing it down. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1260.18s)]
*  So not only did the state of California, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1262.18s)]
*  which you referenced there, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1264.46s)]
*  ban the use of gestation crates inside California, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1266.18s)]
*  and unfortunately, most of the states that have done so [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1271.3799999999999s)]
*  are not the states where most of these farms exist. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1273.62s)]
*  They exist in places like Iowa, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1276.62s)]
*  where those states are completely dominated [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1278.18s)]
*  by these industries. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1280.5s)]
*  But the Californians also went in a referendum, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1281.78s)]
*  banned the importation into California [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1284.86s)]
*  of any pork products that are from factories [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1287.7s)]
*  that have gestation crates. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1291.3799999999999s)]
*  And the association representing this industry [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1293.78s)]
*  sued the state of California, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1296.8999999999999s)]
*  it went to the Supreme Court. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1298.62s)]
*  The Biden administration entered the case [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1299.98s)]
*  and cited on the side of the animal agriculture industry, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1302.94s)]
*  saying California has no right to import pork. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1307.94s)]
*  They're not allowed to ban the importation of pigs [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1311.98s)]
*  from other states that don't have the same ethical standards [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1316.0600000000002s)]
*  as they do, and the Supreme Court ruled [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1318.7800000000002s)]
*  in favor of California, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1320.46s)]
*  one of the most important victories [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1321.5800000000002s)]
*  in the history of animal agriculture [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1323.9s)]
*  and animal activism at the Supreme Court level. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1326.5800000000002s)]
*  Here I want to show you one more video [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1329.7s)]
*  of what's called the culling process, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1332.7800000000002s)]
*  where the male chicks are selected and picked out [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1335.1000000000001s)]
*  minutes after they're born, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1339.66s)]
*  and then just immediately extinguished. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1341.42s)]
*  There are a lot of philosophies, a lot of religions, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1344.7s)]
*  a lot of cultures that believe in the justice [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1353.54s)]
*  of killing animals and using them for food, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1355.9s)]
*  but I don't think there's any humane point of view [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1358.7s)]
*  or philosophy or worldview that can justify [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1365.1s)]
*  treating live creatures that are part of the universe [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1368.7s)]
*  in a completely industrialized and inhumane way. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1372.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't believe there's anyone looking at these videos [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1376.1000000000001s)]
*  who doesn't feel a sense of serious discomfort. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1378.5s)]
*  You should ask yourself why that is. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4tFmfo4JD8&t=1381.38s)]
