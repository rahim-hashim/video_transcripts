# Zelensky REJECTS Trump's Ukraine Proposal
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ)
*  This war, even though we don't talk about it anymore, and I don't mean we specifically [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on the show, sometimes we do, but I mean we collectively, we as a country, just kind of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  a word that goes on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  People are dying still every day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=15.24s)]
*  People are being bombed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=16.6s)]
*  People are being chased with drones. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=17.6s)]
*  There are all kinds of missiles being launched continuously. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=20.88s)]
*  The dangers of escalation continue to unfold. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=23.76s)]
*  And I have to say the Trump administration, despite my many critiques of much of what [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=28.16s)]
*  they're doing, deserves a lot of credit because they really are following through in a very [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=31.6s)]
*  aggressive way in an attempt to bring about an end to this war diplomatically. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=36.12s)]
*  And the reality of the war, whether people like it or not, is that Russia is winning [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=42.56s)]
*  the war. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Russia has been dominating the war. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Ukraine has far more of a reason to end the war than Russia does. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  And of course, whatever diplomatic solution, whatever diplomatic resolution is achieved, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=54.0s)]
*  will be more favorable to Russia than it is to Ukraine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=58.92s)]
*  And yet we're already seeing people accusing Trump of being some sort of surrender, having [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=62.88s)]
*  surrendered to the Russians or capitulating to the Russians because the proposals that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=69.2s)]
*  they're talking about, which are the only ones that have any chance of ending the war, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=73.2s)]
*  have terms that are favorable to Russia in them for the obvious reason that Russia is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=77.68s)]
*  and Russia would never accept terms not favorable to it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=82.08s)]
*  And it seems as though many of the terms that Zelensky is going to end up having to accept [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  are ones he's refusing to accept and Trump's frustration with Ukraine is growing and growing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=91.36s)]
*  And we'll see where that ends up leading. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=96.0s)]
*  First of all, here from CNN earlier today, Trump administration is ready to recognize [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=98.8s)]
*  the Russian control of Crimea as part of a framework to end the Ukraine war, sources [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=102.84s)]
*  say. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=108.8s)]
*  As you might recall, Crimea had for centuries been part of Russia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=109.8s)]
*  It ended up being part of Ukraine through a series of complicated transactions that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=114.92s)]
*  Putin has said many times he regards as an error. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=118.96s)]
*  And in 2014, when the United States government with Victoria Nuland and John McCain and Chris [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=124.2s)]
*  Murphy, the whole gang went over and helped overthrow the democratically elected government [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=130.76s)]
*  in Kiev that was more leaning toward Moscow than to the EU. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=136.12s)]
*  And that was the reason we overthrew them and instead installed a much more pro-EU pro-US [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=140.28s)]
*  government in response to having the EU and the US so now dominant inside Ukraine on the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=145.28s)]
*  other side of the Russian border that they were even changing the government. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=155.68s)]
*  The Russians took Crimea, an extremely geostrategically important spot. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=158.72s)]
*  It's what gives them access to the Black Sea. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=162.0s)]
*  And the reality is that the people of Crimea, nobody doubts this, overwhelmingly, I'm talking [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=165.04s)]
*  about 90%, identify as Russian, not as Ukrainian. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=169.76s)]
*  They are far more loyal to the Russians, they want to be governed by Moscow and not by Kiev. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=175.0s)]
*  And there's no possibility that the Russians will ever give back Crimea, especially with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=181.16s)]
*  NATO so involved in Ukraine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=186.0s)]
*  And so what the Trump administration is doing is simply saying that we, the United States, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=189.12s)]
*  will recognize that Crimea is part of Russia. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=192.76s)]
*  Not that the Ukrainians have to, not that the Europeans have to, just that we, the Americans, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=197.64s)]
*  will because the reality is that Crimea is never going back to Ukraine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=201.6s)]
*  And yet that's something Zelensky refuses to accept. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=207.04s)]
*  Quote, Crimea, southern Ukraine, has been under Russian occupation since it was illegally [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=209.6s)]
*  annexed in 2014. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=214.22s)]
*  Four other Ukrainian regions, Donetsk and Luhangt in the east and then two others in the south [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=216.56s)]
*  have been partially occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion in 2022. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=222.44s)]
*  Zelensky said the time that the territories would, quote, probably be one of the most [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=226.88s)]
*  sensitive and difficult issues in peace negotiations. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=230.6s)]
*  Adding that, quote, for us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=234.28s)]
*  occupied territories as Russian. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  We will not go for it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=241.0s)]
*  I have news for Zelensky. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=242.96s)]
*  Russia is occupying and controlling Ukraine and those other provinces in eastern Ukraine, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=245.8s)]
*  whether he likes it or not. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=251.28s)]
*  He may wish there was a fantasy world where Ukraine was going to control it, but there [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=253.32s)]
*  is no world in which that will ever happen. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=256.88s)]
*  And so obviously the Americans are trying to work within the Russian reality and the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=260.24s)]
*  Ukrainian reality when you try and negotiate a war. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=263.68s)]
*  And Steve Wittkopf, by all accounts, has been doing an excellent job of genuinely trying [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=265.84s)]
*  to foster an end to this war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=271.28s)]
*  And what he has been saying and others have been saying is that you need to understand [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=274.28s)]
*  things from the Russian perspective and the Ukrainian perspective to understand what's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=277.32s)]
*  possible in a deal, which is basic diplomacy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=280.68s)]
*  The Biden administration won't even talk to Russia. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=283.92s)]
*  The EU won't even talk to Russia. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=285.68s)]
*  So the Trump administration is doing so in a way that will advance this diplomacy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=287.24s)]
*  According to Financial Times, also today, Vladimir Putin offers to halt Ukraine invasion [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=293.64s)]
*  along the current front line. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=299.52s)]
*  The US floats recognition of Russian annexation of Crimea as the peace plan efforts continue. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=302.52s)]
*  The Russian president told Steve Wittkopf, Trump's special envoy, during a meeting in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=307.76s)]
*  St. Petersburg this month that Moscow could relinquish its claims to areas of four partly [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=312.08s)]
*  occupied Ukrainian regions that remain under Kiev's control. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  Three of the people said the US have since floated ideas for a possible settlement that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=323.12s)]
*  includes Washington's recognition, Washington's recognizing Russian ownership of Ukraine's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=327.46s)]
*  peninsula, the people added, as well as at least acknowledging the Kremlin's de facto [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=334.11999999999995s)]
*  control over the parts of the four regions it currently holds. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=338.32s)]
*  The proposal is the first formal indication Putin has given since the war's early months [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  that three years ago that Russia could step back from its maximalist demands to end the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  invasion. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=353.67999999999995s)]
*  This has always been the obvious outline of some kind of resolution we've been talking [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=356.52s)]
*  about on this show for three years now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=360.24s)]
*  The real Russian objective was never to take over all of Ukraine. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=363.44s)]
*  That might have been their view at the very beginning, I even doubt that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  Their concern was with these eastern provinces of Ukraine where the majority of people, the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=371.92s)]
*  vast majority of people are Russian speaking and ethnic Russian. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=376.16s)]
*  And the perception was, correctly, that the Kiev government had become increasingly brutalizing [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  and abusive of their rights, had disregarded their cultural history and their religious [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=385.92s)]
*  traditions. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=390.64s)]
*  And that was why there was a low-grade civil war, basically a war for independence going [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=392.36s)]
*  back to 2014 between these eastern provinces, these provinces in eastern Ukraine and Kiev. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=397.2s)]
*  And the Russians, on top of wanting to preserve and protect the rights of the people who live [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=404.88s)]
*  there, also want that as a buffer zone. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=408.72s)]
*  So if they have these four provinces, it's not as easy for NATO to go up to the Russian [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=412.22s)]
*  border. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=419.62s)]
*  And that was always the solution. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  NATO doesn't go in Ukraine and Crimea stays with Russia and these four provinces have [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=423.42s)]
*  some sort of semi-autonomous or autonomous status depending on what they want in a referendum [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=430.5s)]
*  or join Russia and become part of Russia. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=436.3s)]
*  And that gives the Russians the buffer zone and the security that they need that Ukraine [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=439.74s)]
*  won't be a NATO as well. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=442.86s)]
*  And then Ukraine gets some sort of ambiguous security guarantee from some combination of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=445.02s)]
*  Europe and the US. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  This is what the kind of negotiation looked at, like at the beginning of the war back [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=451.46000000000004s)]
*  in March and April of 2022 when the two sides were very close to negotiating an agreement [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=455.86s)]
*  that could have averted this war. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=462.22s)]
*  And that was when Boris Johnson and Victoria Nuland swept in and told Zelensky that under [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=464.06s)]
*  no circumstances can he agree to that resolution and they will promise to give him all the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=468.46000000000004s)]
*  money and weapons he needs to fight the Russians until the very end and those are the people [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=473.42s)]
*  who have all this blood on their hands. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=477.54s)]
*  Now it is always strange that Zelensky is in this position where he depends upon the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=481.3s)]
*  United States, depends upon the Trump administration to fund his war effort, to give him the weapons [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=488.18s)]
*  he needs to even be able to stay competitive in this war. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=494.58s)]
*  And when that happens, when you're dependent, kind of a vassal state, and that state tells [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=499.42s)]
*  you look, we're not going to continue to support this war, here's an agreement that we think [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=503.98s)]
*  is fair for you, and you keep telling that country we don't want this, we're not going [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=507.94s)]
*  to accept this, as Trump told Zelensky in the White House, you don't have that many [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=512.42s)]
*  cards to play. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=516.58s)]
*  And yet Zelensky continues to act as though he's the one dictating the terms. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=518.26s)]
*  Earlier today, Ukraine's Zelensky pushes back on a U.S. peace plan. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=523.6199999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainian president said his country would never recognize Russian control of Crimea, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=529.6999999999999s)]
*  a key Russian demand. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea, Zelensky said at a press conference [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=536.0999999999999s)]
*  here on Tuesday. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=540.16s)]
*  There's nothing to talk about here. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=542.8599999999999s)]
*  This is against our constitution. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=544.3399999999999s)]
*  Zelensky's dismissal upends Trump's latest gambit to halt the war in Ukraine. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=547.42s)]
*  Now in its fourth year and casts new uncertainty on the future of the relationship between [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=552.48s)]
*  Kiev and Washington, which Trump has made conditional on a quick deal, Zelensky said [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=557.34s)]
*  Russia should agree to a ceasefire before further talks to demonstrate, quote, serious [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=561.94s)]
*  steps and not childishness. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=566.7s)]
*  The Russians have always said they're never going to agree to a ceasefire without a full [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=571.12s)]
*  deal being in place that would just allow the Ukrainians to rearm. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=574.4s)]
*  And the only way to meaningfully end this war is to have an actual resolution that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=579.08s)]
*  will end the war as opposed to just freezing the conflict. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=583.44s)]
*  Now when Zelensky said, and if you see the video of him saying it, he's very kind of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=588.64s)]
*  arrogant about it, he's very definitive about it, he's saying, look, we're not ever going [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=594.12s)]
*  to accept that Crimea belongs to Russia. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=599.2800000000001s)]
*  And note that the peace plan put forward by the Trump administration didn't even require [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  Ukraine to acknowledge that Crimea belongs to Russia. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=608.08s)]
*  Who cares if Ukraine acknowledges that or not? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=611.8000000000001s)]
*  That's still the reality, whether Ukraine accepts it or not. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=613.84s)]
*  The peace plan was that the United States would recognize Crimea as being Russian. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=617.32s)]
*  But the defiance of Zelensky yet again, when he depends upon the Trump administration, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=623.12s)]
*  the United States, the American taxpayer to fund his war, was something that, to put it [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=630.6s)]
*  did not sit well with Trump. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  And he had one of those reactions he's had to Zelensky in the past. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=639.48s)]
*  Quote, this is what he posted on True Social earlier today. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=642.5200000000001s)]
*  Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is boasting on the front page of the Wall Street Journal [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=646.12s)]
*  that, quote, Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=651.12s)]
*  There's nothing to talk about here. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=655.8000000000001s)]
*  This statement is very harmful to the peace negotiations with Russia in that Crimea was [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=658.24s)]
*  lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama and is not even a point [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=663.04s)]
*  of discussion. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=668.68s)]
*  Nobody is asking Zelensky to recognize Crimea as Russian territory. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=669.68s)]
*  But if he wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  to Russia without a shot being fired? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  The area also houses, for many years before, quote, the Obama handover, many Russian submarine [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  bases. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=686.4s)]
*  It's inflammatory statements like Zelensky's that makes it so difficult to settle this [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=687.48s)]
*  war. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=691.68s)]
*  He has nothing to boast about. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=692.84s)]
*  The situation for Ukraine is dire. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=694.4s)]
*  He can have peace or he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=697.02s)]
*  I have nothing to do with Russia but have much to do with wanting to save, on average, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week who are dying for no reason whatsoever. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  The statement made by Zelensky today will do nothing but prolong the, quote, killing [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=711.64s)]
*  field and nobody wants that. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=716.0s)]
*  We are very close to a deal but the man with, quote, no cards to play should now finally [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=718.82s)]
*  get it done. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=723.98s)]
*  I look forward to being able to help Ukraine and Russia get out of this complete and total [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=724.98s)]
*  mess that would never have started if I were president. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=730.1s)]
*  Now again, it is true that the United States, independent of who you think is right or wrong [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=734.86s)]
*  or what you think the right outcome is, has a very strong interest in ending this war. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=740.94s)]
*  We're paying for the war. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=744.82s)]
*  Not all of it. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=746.62s)]
*  The Europeans are paying for a lot of it as well. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=747.62s)]
*  Our stockpiles are being depleted, especially when we also have to feed the Israelis arms [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=749.9000000000001s)]
*  and now we're using a ton of arms ourselves to bomb Yemen. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=754.6600000000001s)]
*  We have this rapidly depleting stockpile and the American government should have as its [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=758.46s)]
*  primary concern the interests of the American people in the United States and it has never [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=764.74s)]
*  been in the interests of the American people. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  I have said this from the very start. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=773.5s)]
*  To fight a war with Russia, even a proxy war over who rules various provinces of eastern [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=776.82s)]
*  Ukraine, whether they stay under the governance of Kiev, whether they end up autonomous or [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=782.34s)]
*  semi-autonomous, whether they end up with Moscow where most of the people prefer, what [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=788.26s)]
*  impact does that have on the American people and their material well-being at all? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=795.46s)]
*  Even the Trump administration seems to be reaching the end of their rope in terms of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=800.58s)]
*  their willingness to allow Zelensky to act as though he has equal leverage in any of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=804.7800000000001s)]
*  this when he clearly doesn't. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYtU7HV_rgQ&t=810.82s)]
