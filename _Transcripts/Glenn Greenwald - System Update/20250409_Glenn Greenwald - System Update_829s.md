# Fox News Journalist DEBUNKS IDF Lie
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg)
*  Here, just about Yemen, we talked about this song, but Trump posted this video. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=0.0s)]
*  He was very proud of it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=13.52s)]
*  There are, as you can see on the screen, I think, yeah, you can see there on the screen, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  This is Yemen, with about, I would estimate, 60, maybe 70 Yemenis sitting around, standing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=23.84s)]
*  up in open, out in the open. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=30.72s)]
*  None of them are carrying guns, and even if they were, like you're allowed to carry guns, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=34.64s)]
*  doesn't make you a bad person. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  I think we hear that all the time from the American right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  I agree with that, like you have a gun, doesn't make you a bad person, doesn't mean you're [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=42.64s)]
*  going to go kill somebody, doesn't make you a terrorist. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  But they're just standing there in a circle. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a very common formation for Yemeni tribes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=52.16s)]
*  This is how tribes meet. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Trump claimed that these were people plotting to go and bomb American ships. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  He said, we're not going to let the Houthis bomb our, blow up our ships again. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=64.8s)]
*  The Houthis never blow up an American ship. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=69.84s)]
*  They once claimed they attacked a ship, the Defense Department said that, it was totally false. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=73.28s)]
*  Israel bombed an American ship. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=77.52s)]
*  The US has liberty, and 1967 killed a lot of people, a lot of Americans, all forgotten. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=79.16s)]
*  But here is Trump very proudly saying these people were plotting a terrorist attack on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=85.08s)]
*  an American ship, even though the Houthis said before the bombing of Yemen began, we're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=90.24s)]
*  only attacking an Israeli ship. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=93.96s)]
*  Knowing that there's American drones all over the place, that the US is bombing constantly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=96.52s)]
*  all throughout the country, why would they meet just outdoors and stand in a perfect [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  visible formation if they were actually terrorists or whatever, plotting a military operation? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=103.72s)]
*  That's not what they would do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=107.64s)]
*  But here's what the United States did, and Donald Trump was very proud of it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=109.56s)]
*  Trump said, oh look, they were plotting to attack a ship, they're a big bomb, they're [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=115.28s)]
*  all dead, woo. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=118.44s)]
*  Look there's no one left, totally destroyed every living person that was there, despite [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=121.68s)]
*  having no idea who they were. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  And you had a lot of conservatives who just rejuvenated their act from the war on terror. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=128.12s)]
*  Like hey, we don't want any more Middle East wars. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=135.36s)]
*  Oh, those are terrorists, yeah, blow up those terrorists, just bomb, keep killing the terrorists, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=137.32s)]
*  hell yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=142.28s)]
*  Like getting that pulsating sensation of strength. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=143.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, just one last point about Israel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=147.0s)]
*  They murdered 15 Palestinian medics, ambulance drivers, people who save the lives of others. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  At first they said, when these people went missing, they just disappeared from the face [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=161.4s)]
*  of the earth, nobody knew where they were, they just didn't come home, their ambulances [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=167.32s)]
*  were nowhere to be found. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=171.2s)]
*  The Israelis said, I don't know, we don't have anything to do with it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=172.2s)]
*  And then when it became apparent that they were killed, the IDF said, no, actually what [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=175.64s)]
*  happened was we did kill them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=179.28s)]
*  And the reason we killed them is because they were ambulances, but they didn't have their [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=181.72s)]
*  emergency lights on or sirens on, and they were approaching our vehicles in very suspicious [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=188.56s)]
*  ways. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=195.28s)]
*  That's always what the IDF says whenever they are caught killing people, including innocent [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=197.0s)]
*  people like these medics. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=201.84s)]
*  They say, oh yeah, they were terrorists, they didn't have their emergency lights on, they [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=202.84s)]
*  were attacking our troops, they were putting our troops in danger, that's what they said, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=206.88s)]
*  and everybody printed it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  Oh, Israel says that they killed them because they were terrorists, whatever, and that's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=212.24s)]
*  usually the end of it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=215.88s)]
*  The question was, when the Palestinians found them, they were buried in the dirt along with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=219.2s)]
*  their ambulances. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=223.72s)]
*  So the Israelis didn't just murder these people, they didn't bury them, and they said, well, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=224.72s)]
*  if these were terrorists, why did you bury them? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=229.64s)]
*  Seemingly hide the evidence. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=231.72s)]
*  And the IDF said, we wanted to respect their bodies, because what happens is if you leave [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=232.72s)]
*  corpses out in Gaza, the animals come and eat them, because animals have no food like [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=237.6s)]
*  the humans. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=240.88s)]
*  Because the Israelis are so, so concerned about the dignity of Palestinians, they care [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=241.88s)]
*  so deeply about it, but then they also buried the ambulance. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=247.28s)]
*  Why would you bury the ambulance as well? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=250.72s)]
*  Would the animals eat the ambulance? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=252.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, for Israel, there was one of the medics who ended up being murdered who [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=255.24s)]
*  was videoing the scene prior to him being killed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=266.08s)]
*  You can hear him saying kind of his last words, some apologies to his mother, saying [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=272.2s)]
*  his last prayers, he knew he was going to die. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=278.32s)]
*  And it was on his cell phone, and the Israelis just neglected to take it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=281.68s)]
*  And so when they dug it up, they found the cell phone. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  And you could see very clearly on the cell phone that everything the IDF said was an [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=287.84s)]
*  absolute lie. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=290.48s)]
*  These were ambulances with their lights on, their sirens on, the workers, the medics were [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=293.28s)]
*  wearing the orange neon identifiable vest as rescue workers, and they were rescuing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=298.68s)]
*  a truck that the Israelis had just shot up and killed people in. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=305.2s)]
*  They didn't approach the IDF in any way. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=309.68s)]
*  Everything that Israel said was a lie, which happens all the time, except when there's [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=312.04s)]
*  a video of that emerges and then Israel's like, oh, yeah, we lied. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=316.04s)]
*  And we're going to walk it back, like what happened with the American journalist. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=320.24s)]
*  And it never makes anyone wonder, like, hey, the next time the IDF kills a bunch of people [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  and claims it's because they're terrorists, like, maybe we should be skeptical of that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=326.76s)]
*  because every time there's a video that emerges, it shows that what they were saying was a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=329.44s)]
*  lie. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=332.52s)]
*  Here from CBS News on April 6, Israel walks back its account of Gaza medic killings after [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=334.88s)]
*  video surfaces of the attack. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=340.52s)]
*  The Israeli military initially set it open fire because the vehicles were, quote, advancing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=343.12s)]
*  suspiciously. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=346.92s)]
*  A nearby troops without headlights are emergency signals. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=347.92s)]
*  An Israeli military official speaking late Sunday on condition of anonymity in line with [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=351.96s)]
*  regulations said that account was, whoops, mistaken. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=355.88s)]
*  Yeah, we shot all these people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=358.84s)]
*  We said they were terrorists. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=361.96s)]
*  We lied that they didn't have their lights on, that they were approaching us. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=362.96s)]
*  And nope, that just, we were mistaken. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=365.0s)]
*  Just everyone makes mistakes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=366.64s)]
*  Everyone kills 15 aid workers all at once and buries them underground in the lies about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=369.12s)]
*  what they did. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=373.32s)]
*  Eight Red Crescent personnel, six civil defense workers and a UN staffer were killed in the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=375.88s)]
*  shooting before dawn on March 23 by Israeli troops, conduct on operations in Tel Al-Sultan, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=379.76s)]
*  a district of the southern Gaza city of Ra'afa. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=385.08s)]
*  Troops then bulldozed over the bodies with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  grave. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=393.08s)]
*  UN and rescue workers were only able to reach the site a week later to dig out the bodies. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=394.08s)]
*  To their great credit, it was the New York Times that obtained the video that was taken [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=402.32s)]
*  by one of the slaughtered medics. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=406.32s)]
*  And you can hear him saying his last words. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=411.28s)]
*  You can also see the, very clearly, the ambulances with their lights on, with their alarms on, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=413.56s)]
*  their blinkers on, and the rescue workers dressed exactly how they should be, not even [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=421.8s)]
*  remotely approaching Israeli troops, and they just opened fire on them and killed them all. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=426.72s)]
*  And here you can see it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  This is the medic in the car who is filming. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=435.32s)]
*  You can see the ambulance in front of him exactly with the lights on. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  There's another one with the lights on. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=443.0s)]
*  That's a fire truck. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=444.44s)]
*  And then there's an ambulance. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=445.44s)]
*  He's in an ambulance as well filming. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=446.8s)]
*  And they're driving along exactly like rescue workers should. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=453.92s)]
*  There's another ambulance with its siren on. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=458.64s)]
*  Here are people going to rescue people, to help people when they're injured, to take [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=461.2s)]
*  them to the hospital, to administer life-saving treatment and aid to them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=465.64s)]
*  And these are some of the noblest work that you can do. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=470.32s)]
*  And here you see them stopping at this side of the road where that car is with the people [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=479.44s)]
*  who were shot and killed. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=483.68s)]
*  They were going to see if any of them were alive, to see if they needed medical assistance, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=486.48s)]
*  if there were any survivors to be taken to the hospital, exactly what ambulances should do. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=489.92s)]
*  You see here they stopped on the side of the road. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=496.0s)]
*  Not approaching Israeli military at all. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=500.56s)]
*  They're getting out of their car to go to that van. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=505.52s)]
*  And then there's the Israeli shooting. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=511.52s)]
*  Huge numbers of bullets. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=514.56s)]
*  Remember, the Israelis said, oh, they approached our vehicles. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=515.92s)]
*  None of this happened. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  Trey Yanks is an excellent war correspondent for Fox News. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=535.28s)]
*  He reports from Israel. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  He often reports on missile attacks on Israel. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=542.72s)]
*  But he has also spoken up in defense of Palestinian journalists, saying, why are we not defending [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=548.08s)]
*  Palestinian journalists being killed by Israel constantly when we are journalists? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=553.76s)]
*  We're supposed to stand up for journalists? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=556.64s)]
*  And he's reported, very honestly, about a lot of the things that Israel is doing in [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=559.84s)]
*  Gaza, in a way that almost no one else in corporate media is. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  Listen to this report that he produced for Fox News about this incident. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=566.72s)]
*  Paramedics from the Palestine Red Crescent dig through the earth of southern Gaza. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=575.68s)]
*  They're recovering the bodies of their colleagues killed by Israeli forces. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=580.64s)]
*  On March 23, first responders were dispatched to this area of Rafa. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  When they arrived, Israeli soldiers opened fire. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=590.16s)]
*  Health workers should never be a target. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=597.04s)]
*  And yet we're here today digging up a mass grave of first responders and paramedics. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=600.08s)]
*  On March 31, the IDF provided a statement to Fox News saying, quote, several vehicles [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=604.8s)]
*  were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=610.48s)]
*  signals. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=616.24s)]
*  Video released five days later by the Palestine Red Crescent directly contradicts that statement. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  The IDF also claimed in the initial findings that nine out of the 15 medics were operatives [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=623.2s)]
*  in Hamas and Islamic Jihad. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=628.72s)]
*  Asked multiple times for evidence to support that claim, none was provided. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=630.8s)]
*  Funerals were... [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=635.44s)]
*  I mean, that is very straightforward. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  The IDF told Fox News repeatedly that this happened. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=640.08s)]
*  This video that was obtained and filmed by one of the workers who was murdered and that [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=645.28s)]
*  he was buried underground with a cell phone that was then discovered contradicts everything [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=650.8s)]
*  Israel said. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=655.92s)]
*  They then switched to, oh, don't worry, nine of them out of the 15 were Hamas operatives. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  And Fox News said, well, meaning Trading Inc. said, well, show us the evidence, which is [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  what a journalist does in the face of a claim by the government. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  And the Israelis just refused to provide any. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=669.04s)]
*  Every time there's evidence of what happens as opposed to an IDF claim, they get caught [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=672.88s)]
*  lying. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Here's the rest of this. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=676.8s)]
*  For evidence to support that claim, none was provided. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=678.16s)]
*  Funerals were held late last week for those killed by Israeli bullets. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=682.88s)]
*  Families mourning the dead, mothers trying to make sense of the senseless. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=686.7199999999999s)]
*  He went to save the martyrs and injured. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=692.64s)]
*  And we've been waiting for him for a week. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  We were told that he was either martyred or injured. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=696.8s)]
*  But I realized that they had killed them from the very first moment. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=699.3599999999999s)]
*  They had killed them and buried them underground. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  As bodies of these medics rest inside white plastic bags with a photo attached, the face [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=706.0s)]
*  of Rifaad Radwan stands out, the man who recorded his final moments with a final message. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  Forgive me, Mother. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  This is the path I chose to help. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=720.16s)]
*  He said. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  Massive credit to Trading Inc. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=725.76s)]
*  And whoever else produced that news report for Fox, that takes a great amount of courage. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  It takes courage to say that about Israel on any network. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  To say it on Fox News takes even more for obvious reasons. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=735.92s)]
*  And out of all this horror and suffering, which by the way, the US has paid for, the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=739.04s)]
*  US paid for that murder and that massacre of aid workers. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=743.5999999999999s)]
*  The US taxpayer pays it all, all our weapons being sent there to use. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=748.0s)]
*  Out of all the horrors of what's going on, these multiple Mideast wars again. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=752.4s)]
*  The ratcheting up of the defense budget by a president who repeatedly vowed to do none of this. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=758.88s)]
*  At least there's some nobility. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=764.24s)]
*  There's courage in a lot of the Palestinians, people working as aid workers and journalists [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=767.28s)]
*  knowing that their targets Israel just targeted a tent of Israeli journalists. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=771.12s)]
*  And you have like young journalists, including a couple who have been on our show, 19, 20, 24. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=775.04s)]
*  You continue to report knowing it puts them in danger. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  You have aid workers continuing to do that, knowing it puts them in danger. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=783.68s)]
*  And it's actually quite refreshing to see a reporter who works for Fox News being willing [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=786.96s)]
*  to just report truthfully with no agenda without caring who's alienated by it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=792.4s)]
*  That's what journalism is missing more than anything. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=797.36s)]
*  And we need so much more of that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox8njr0KnNg&t=800.0799999999999s)]
