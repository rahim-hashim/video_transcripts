# Tucker Carlson on New Networkâ€”Avoiding Audience Capture
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw)
*  I do need to ask you with the time I have left about the Tucker Carlson network in part [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=0.0s)]
*  because I actually have questions about it and I want to know about it and I want people [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=11.32s)]
*  to hear about it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  So let me just begin by asking you like what is the core idea of this and what is it that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=15.48s)]
*  you decided you wanted to do that isn't readily available or being done by other people with [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=20.2s)]
*  this new network? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=25.92s)]
*  Well I never would have done anything if I had stayed in my previous job and I probably [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=28.92s)]
*  would have stayed if I hadn't been fired so you know I'm so grateful that I was because [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=33.96s)]
*  you know you just sort of get into I mean you've got a daily show you know you just [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=39.2s)]
*  get into the rhythm of it and so I was forced to decide to do this and I'm so thankful that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=42.42s)]
*  that happened I mean it too and so basically I want to do what I was doing before but with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  an even more inflexible commitment to honesty, true honesty and not just in my professional [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  life but in my personal life I mean I really want to be honest for the rest of my life [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=61.28s)]
*  I've decided. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=65.0s)]
*  So how do you do that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=66.0s)]
*  Well we've been doing it on X we're also on Rumble by the way and proud to be. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=67.84s)]
*  The guy who runs Rumble obviously you know him very well Chris Pavlovsky is really one [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  of the good people in the world and certainly one of the best people in media so I'm proud [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=78.04s)]
*  of that but it really comes down to the question like how do you pay for a staff because we [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=81.76s)]
*  took most of our staff from Fox and another thing I'm truly grateful for every day the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  best people but how do you do it in a way that's invulnerable that's protected I mean [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=91.72s)]
*  we're about to enter into real volatility in my opinion over the next 12 months you [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=96.56s)]
*  need you can't have an advertising model for that and I've lived that for decades you pay [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=101.2s)]
*  the bills with advertising and sleeping giants or SPLC or you know one of these groups media [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=106.16s)]
*  matters comes in and takes all your advertisers away and then your business is done and you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=113.0s)]
*  can't speak so a subscription model from my perspective is necessary and so we have a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=116.6s)]
*  subscription model at Tucker Carlson.com we're putting a lot of stuff out for free and then [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=123.88s)]
*  we're putting some stuff on that site and we hope to cover the news and to do it kind of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=129.76s)]
*  in a bigger scale and we've got a lot of people working there we're gonna have a lot more working [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=137.6s)]
*  there you like want to hire reporters and like have bureaus around the world to actually report [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=141.16s)]
*  on news not just to do punditry not just to do opine but also your show but then a team of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=145.72s)]
*  journalists. Yes that's exactly right and that's achievable it's actually and I won't bore you [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=151.36s)]
*  because it's not that interesting this is all like terms of art stuff but it's it's not that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  expensive and I learned that this summer we did seven foreign trips and I was paying for them [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  myself because I didn't have a job and I was sort of amazed by how cheaply you could do it if you [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=167.68s)]
*  had good people I mean we did interviews in foreign countries with three people me and a producer our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=172.52s)]
*  cameraman Kyle Rothenberg it was like it was incredible so you could actually get a lot done [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=176.76s)]
*  you could cover a lot of news honestly with you know with 50 people or a hundred people I mean you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=183.32s)]
*  could really replicate the efforts of a very big news organization and I think you're gonna need [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  to do that because the truth is and you know this because you've lived it for so long the number of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=194.84s)]
*  stories that legacy media cover is so limited they're like eight stories each is like a serial [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=200.0s)]
*  and they keep pushing you know whatever it is help Zelensky send the Gaza refugees to New Mexico [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=205.68s)]
*  or whatever line that they're pushing this week they never talk about anything else and so there's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=212.08s)]
*  all these amazing things going on they get no coverage whatsoever and that's a huge hole that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  needs to be filled and I want to help fill it and so that's what we're doing yeah I mean one of the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=221.84s)]
*  things they just don't cover which ends up being as a result most things is the only really cover [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  issues where they get presented as the Democrats and the Republicans fighting over something as [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=230.72s)]
*  you were saying earlier it has to have a partisan angle the reality is almost all consequential [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=236.84s)]
*  policies in the United States have bipartisan support they'll be here constantly the two parties [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=242.48s)]
*  can't agree on anything their reality is there's no disagreement and so to these people who do [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=247.04s)]
*  cable news either they don't see that these issues matter because the parties aren't arguing so it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=251.84s)]
*  must be such a clear consensus or there's no benefit in covering it so let me ask you that even [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=257.38s)]
*  though I'm a huge advocate of independent media it's where I am I probably wouldn't be here if I [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=263.62s)]
*  didn't have to leave the intercept I thought at the time it was a very tumultuous bad thing in my [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=268.02s)]
*  life that I had to quit my own media outlet it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=272.02s)]
*  just like you said before for you but there are a couple of flaws in the model or potential flaws [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=275.18s)]
*  in the model one is that if you do rely on subscribers there's that danger of audience [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=281.26s)]
*  capture namely like you know who your audience is you know what they believe and sometimes you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=285.86s)]
*  may have to take positions that you know they don't want to hear and the danger is is that they may [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=290.98s)]
*  go away you may lose your revenue as a result of doing that and then the second one is is that you [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=295.3s)]
*  also then have to talk about the things in which they're interested as opposed to things that you're [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=301.98s)]
*  trying to get them to be interested in have you thought about those challenges and how to navigate [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  those I've thought about it so much I've thought about that so much and thankfully I have a lot [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=312.54s)]
*  of experience on this topic because I lived it for 14 years in my previous job so I showed up there [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  having worked at other networks a number of other networks and they had a going I mean they were the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=324.1s)]
*  dominant news business in in the United States when I showed up I mean I didn't make that company far [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=330.3s)]
*  from it I arrived it was already really successful and they had trained their audience on what the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  storylines were and I was kind of on board for most of them that's why they hired me but there was a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  big one that I really dissented on and that was foreign policy I just was not on board with the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=346.42s)]
*  neocon agenda at all in fact I found it disgusting and and very very contrary to the interest the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=351.38s)]
*  United States and so that was a huge thing for me because you know and I can give you a thousand [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=357.1s)]
*  examples but one of them was Iran there's always been this drumbeat to go to war with Iran and my [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=362.86s)]
*  position on that has never changed why would you want to do that you criticize president Trump for [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=367.54s)]
*  one of his signature foreign policy moves which was killing General Soleimani and for all the talk [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  about how there's no dissent on Fox you were constantly actually doing those sorts of things [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  and somehow you obviously kept your audience and even built it what was the secret to that that you [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=381.98s)]
*  were telling the Fox audience things that they've been trained go ahead exactly and so I actually [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=386.70000000000005s)]
*  went systematically through our contributors at the company and you there's a public record of this [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=392.86s)]
*  I'm not making it up and I would invite them on and they were people our audience had been trained [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  to really love and trust and I would debate them and some of those debates were really tough I mean [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=402.18s)]
*  John Bolton you know I felt like I was gonna get a fistfight with the guy in the set and he was paid [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=407.74s)]
*  by the company I mean he was an employee of the company and and I think you know I would let the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=411.82s)]
*  audience decide who do you think is right he could not defend his positions none of them could and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=417.46000000000004s)]
*  they all left and so I think there was a real peril at the time like well the audience really [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=421.58000000000004s)]
*  likes these people and trust them and thinks they're strong you know anyone calling for war is red as [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  strong well my view was they're weak they're cowards actually and they're hurting you and you don't [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=432.86s)]
*  even know it that was the argument that I was making and in the end I'm not bragging but I think [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  I was able to bring the audience to my side by being rational and trying to be super honest at [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=443.82s)]
*  turn and my belief is that I know you know this because you do a show people can smell it on you [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=451.1s)]
*  it's like dogs like they know you can't fake that I mean a dog knows if you're deceptive a dog knows [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=455.98s)]
*  if you don't like the dog you've got a lot of dogs I know you know this you can't fool a dog [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=461.98s)]
*  actually and you can't fool viewers over time maybe for a day or a week but if they watch you [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=465.66s)]
*  they know who you really are and and so I think I won those arguments and by the time I left and I [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=470.38s)]
*  mean Ukraine was the hardest of all our audience was totally on Ukraine side and I kept it up we [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=476.82000000000005s)]
*  didn't lose audience share it all and so are the hosts on all sides of you you know it would be [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=483.42s)]
*  like three hours of pro-Ukraine Tucker Carlson against it more pro-Ukraine stuff and you carved [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=488.18s)]
*  out this hour of dissent where your audience ultimately went with you on it which is why they [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=494.06s)]
*  were happy when you were gone well exactly so you can't in other words they you know I don't [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  think the audience tunes in to have them you know to have you give them the finger I don't think [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=504.26000000000005s)]
*  that they don't want you to hate them and I don't hate them of course I love them but they also want [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=509.06s)]
*  to be taught and led like that's that's your job your job is not to repeat back to people what they [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  want to believe your job is they're busy they're working my whole profession is to sit in the middle [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=521.1s)]
*  of the day and take a sauna and think about this stuff that's what I do for a living so there's [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=527.9s)]
*  the expectation that you're gonna teach them something try to convince them of something try [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=532.18s)]
*  to lead in a sense I'm not a leader of anybody I'm just a talk show host but but in a moral sense [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=536.3399999999999s)]
*  like to take a position that other people won't take and to explain why you're taking it and to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=542.26s)]
*  bring them over and that works I know I'll just say one last thing we when we started doing these [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=547.54s)]
*  Ukraine segments which are pretty tough I had a gut level dislike for Zelensky just for watching [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=553.38s)]
*  him I said this is this guy's bad I could just feel it and and I said it and people were very [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=559.06s)]
*  offended and there was a sense that in the company that we're gonna lose a lot of audience share over [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=564.54s)]
*  this and by the end by the week I left our Ukraine segments were the highest rated segments we did [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=570.5s)]
*  which is a pretty good measure I think and so you can bring people to your side as long as you're [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=576.26s)]
*  reasonable and sympathetic to them you're not judging them they have a different view you're [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=581.7399999999999s)]
*  not mad at them about that you're not gonna call them Nazis or Putin sympathizers you just tell [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=586.18s)]
*  them what you think and reason it out for them and take your time and you can easily win people [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi2cacmt0vw&t=591.06s)]
