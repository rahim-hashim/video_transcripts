# Trump CO Judge Donated to ‘Anti-1/6’ Activist Group
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4)
*  Here is an important component of this story that has not been widely reported. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=0.0s)]
*  Back in November, a lower-level federal court judge in Colorado, sorry, a state [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=13.6s)]
*  court judge in Colorado, this is where this case first went. It didn't go first [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=22.5s)]
*  to the Supreme Court, it went to a lower-level judge in Colorado. And she [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=26.76s)]
*  basically ruled against Trump on every single last issue. That's why this appeal [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  was so hard for him. She had a trial. She ruled that the January 6 report from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=37.08s)]
*  Liz Cheney and the Democrats was admissible evidence. She credited the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=44.6s)]
*  credibility of almost every anti-Trump witness while dismissing the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  credibility of multiple key Trump witnesses. She concluded that he [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=56.54s)]
*  absolutely was guilty of inciting an insurrection. She ruled that he gave a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  speech on January 6 that fell outside of the protections of Brandenburg because [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=69.94s)]
*  he not only incited a imminent lawless act but intended to do so. She basically [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=75.06s)]
*  adopted the entire MSNBC DNC CNN script of what Trump did on January 6, one [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=81.06s)]
*  paragraph after the next. She found that he was an insurrectionist. And the only [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=86.68s)]
*  reason she did not remove him from the ballot, she ordered him to appear on the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=92.48s)]
*  ballot, she rejected the lawsuit, the only reason was because of a legal [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  technicality that she ruled that section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not apply [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=101.18s)]
*  to the President and Vice President. It only applies to every other office in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=107.86s)]
*  the United States but not to President and Vice President. There is a legal [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=111.9s)]
*  theory that's been around that if you read the text of the 14th Amendment it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=116.22s)]
*  does seem to go out of its way to exclude the President and Vice President, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=119.86s)]
*  doesn't mention them. It just mentions officeholders and so there's been an [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=123.22s)]
*  argument that it doesn't apply to candidates from President and Vice [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=127.3s)]
*  President. And so after spending dozens of pages ruling against Trump on one [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=130.22s)]
*  issue after the next and saying that he incited a violent insurrection on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=137.06s)]
*  purpose, that he is an insurrectionist even though he's never been tried with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=140.54s)]
*  that. The trial she had was not a real trial, it was just an evidentiary hearing, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=144.06s)]
*  nothing like a criminal case. It was like a four-day hearing, very quick, no [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=148.94s)]
*  one, none of the protections that you get when you're a criminal defendant. She [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=155.34s)]
*  ruled against him on everything and that bound the Colorado Supreme Court in a lot [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=160.34s)]
*  of ways in terms of its factual findings. She just at the last minute on the last [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=163.66s)]
*  page you read this ruling and you think this is like reading Rachel Maddow's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=166.94s)]
*  view of January 6th. And then when she got to the end she said I rule in favor [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=171.22s)]
*  of these plaintiffs on every issue except this one legalistic point that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=176.22s)]
*  the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to candidates for President or Vice [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=182.18s)]
*  President therefore the petition is rejected but it bound the parties with [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=184.82s)]
*  these factual findings that were completely against Trump. And as it [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=190.02s)]
*  turns out this judge who did that is such a Democratic Party partisan, is so [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=195.02s)]
*  obviously a resistance liberal who supports the narrative that she put into [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=202.62s)]
*  a legal ruling well before she ever got the case that there were people in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  Colorado arguing that she should have recused herself because of how [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  blatantly political she is as a Democrat and a liberal. Here is one example from [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=216.94s)]
*  the Colorado Gazette. It said Trump's judge fails the standard of appearance by [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=222.9s)]
*  George Brauchler. Quote, if the judge in the Denver trial of whether Donald Trump [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  is eligible to run for president rules against him, this is before she issued [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=233.46s)]
*  the ruling, there will be plenty of fodder for those looking for reasons to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=237.5s)]
*  believe the fix was in and there was no fair due process. The judge is Sarah [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  Wallace, she's the one who wrote that first opinion that the Supreme Court [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=247.74s)]
*  just rejected, it ultimately rejected the petition but well I guess only on a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=250.94s)]
*  very legalistic ground after finding against Trump. And he said I believe [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=256.22s)]
*  Judge Sarah Wallace is qualified, intelligent, competent, and unbiased in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=259.86s)]
*  this matter and she should have recused herself from hearing this case. The [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=264.06s)]
*  applicable rules make clear that the appearance of partiality is what matters [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=268.82s)]
*  and not whether it truly exists. These are ethical rules designed to protect the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=272.42s)]
*  perception of the court as a fair arbiter of justice. That perception is [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=277.42s)]
*  now tarnished. To begin with, several plaintiffs including some registered [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=282.14000000000004s)]
*  Republicans have sued Democratic Secretary of State Jenna Griswold to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  prevent her from allowing Coloradans to have the option of voting for Donald [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=291.98s)]
*  Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Griswold agrees [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=295.26s)]
*  with those suing her, she's a liberal and she wants to lose this lawsuit. She wants [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=299.70000000000005s)]
*  to be banned from putting Trump on the ballot. Characteristic of her consistent [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  and ongoing condemnations of Trump is her unequivocal social media post in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=308.54s)]
*  September quote, Donald Trump incited the insurrection and tried to steal the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=313.82s)]
*  2020 election from the American people. That's the Secretary of State who's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=317.94s)]
*  overseeing the Colorado election saying that. That is awkward for Trump, it gets [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=322.66s)]
*  more awkward for Trump who figuratively sits at Griswold's table in the courtroom. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=327.22s)]
*  Representing Griswold in part is Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=331.62s)]
*  He's the Colorado Attorney General. Weiser called for Trump's impeachment as [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=336.18s)]
*  a result of January 6, 2021. So you see these Colorado officials admitting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=341.22s)]
*  they're complete bias against Trump. They hate Trump, they think he should have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=349.22s)]
*  been impeached for January 6, they already proclaimed him guilty of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  insurrection and the judge in this case who played such a vital role in finding [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=355.38s)]
*  these facts. Judge Wallace contributed to the political campaigns of both [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=360.22s)]
*  Griswold and Weiser while waiting to become a judge. She has never contributed [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=365.54s)]
*  or appears never to have contributed to a Republican. Less than two months [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  after being appointed by Governor Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=375.62s)]
*  Colorado and again despite being a judge and waiting, Wallace contributed a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  hundred dollars to the Colorado turnout project. The our story page of their [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=382.94000000000005s)]
*  website, the first page that appears claims the project was formed [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=388.94s)]
*  shortly after Colorado Republicans refused to condemn the political [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=392.26s)]
*  extremists who stormed the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. They [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=396.22s)]
*  announced the project, quote, aims to prevent violent insurrectionists. Finally [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=401.86s)]
*  the project makes clear its partisan goals, quote, to take the remaining three [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=407.02s)]
*  Republican congressional seats in our state. So you have this judge, she [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=410.82s)]
*  donated her own personal money to a group that said our mission is to make [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=417.14000000000004s)]
*  Trump pay for the insurrection, to remove the three Republican members of the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  House representing our state and replace them with Democrats and she contributed [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=427.38s)]
*  money to the Secretary of State and the Colorado Attorney General, both of whom [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=432.86s)]
*  are Democrats and both of whom made clear their view that Donald Trump was [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=436.14000000000004s)]
*  an insurrectionist. She's the one who decided to sit in judgment of the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  question that of this case that required her to decide is Trump guilty [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=445.68s)]
*  of insurrection and needless to say one paragraph after the next sounded like [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=450.08s)]
*  somebody who just sits in front of the TV watching MSNBC or who donates money [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=454.16s)]
*  that Democratic and Liberal activist groups and Democratic Party candidates [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=458.88s)]
*  and every finding of fact that she issued, which again the Supreme Court [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=462.04s)]
*  was bound and its ruling essentially made clear that she buys the entire [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=468.16s)]
*  resistance narrative about Donald Trump that was not a biased or impartial judge. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=476.82000000000005s)]
*  It was the exact opposite and when you have the question of whether you're [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  going to ban a former president from a ballot and this is the argument I've been [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  making with the indictments of Trump it is vital to at very least go out of your [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  way to make sure it seems politically unbiased so you don't contaminate the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=494.98s)]
*  justice system and seem like you're weaponizing it from political ends and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  that's why it was so disturbing that the four indictments of Trump came from a [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=503.86s)]
*  liberal Democratic prosecutor in Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, a liberal machine [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=509.94s)]
*  Democratic Party machine prosecutor in Atlanta and then two federal cases [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=515.94s)]
*  operating under the auspices of the Biden Justice Department, the Justice [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=521.22s)]
*  Department that answers to President Biden whose primary opponent is Donald [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=524.9s)]
*  Trump and now this case is even worse. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmsa1qTqW4&t=528.9s)]
