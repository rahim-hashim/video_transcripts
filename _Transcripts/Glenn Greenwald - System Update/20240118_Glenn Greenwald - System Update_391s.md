# NEW: Bidenâ€™s Own DOJ Admits Hunter Laptop Authenticity
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg)
*  Speaking of systemic corruption, the corporate media, as you all know, spent the weeks leading [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=0.0s)]
*  up to the 2020 election doing everything possible to discredit and even get banned from the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=12.96s)]
*  internet, reporting by the New York Post about the Biden family's profiteering ventures [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=18.36s)]
*  in Ukraine and China by announcing, citing the CIA and 51 intelligence officials, former [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=23.8s)]
*  intelligence officials, that you shouldn't believe any of the New York Post reporting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  because it was based on a laptop that they've reported to have come from Hunter Biden but [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=33.56s)]
*  was in fact Russian disinformation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  We all know now that that was a complete and total lie concocted by the intelligence community [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=41.36s)]
*  that the corporate media ratified because they were petrified with what that reporting [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=45.28s)]
*  might mean for the 2020 election and Joe Biden's chances to beat Donald Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=49.6s)]
*  And even as these media outlets have gradually admitted that that laptop was actually fully [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=54.04s)]
*  authentic, none, not one, has retracted those lies they spread leading up to the election [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  because they don't care about lies, because lies are actually what they're there to do. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=64.98s)]
*  Now just as a reminder, here was Joe Biden being asked in October 2020 about this entire [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=68.48s)]
*  story and here's how he used those lies from the CIA. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=74.76s)]
*  What about the Americans who really today only want me to ask you about Hunter Biden's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=78.86s)]
*  laptop? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=83.42s)]
*  How are you going to get them to see that you are fighting for them when they're so [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=84.42s)]
*  dead set against you? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=89.94s)]
*  By the way, there's nothing to any of that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=90.94s)]
*  Nothing to any of that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=94.2s)]
*  It's all a smear. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=95.2s)]
*  Every major outfit, every serious investigator has pointed out that this is a smear. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=97.36s)]
*  This is classic Trump. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=104.28s)]
*  We have four days left and all of a sudden there's a laptop. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=106.22s)]
*  And you may recall there's also talk about four months before there was a similar thing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=109.56s)]
*  that somebody had allegedly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=114.38s)]
*  There's overwhelming evidence that from the intelligence community that the Russians are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=116.98s)]
*  engaged. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, this is my son's an honorable man. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  That's how do you see how the system works? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=127.34s)]
*  The CIA that spanned from domestic politics, according to Joe Biden, said this was Russian [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=130.22s)]
*  disinformation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=137.02s)]
*  Then the media goes and repeats it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=138.02s)]
*  Then when Biden was asked about it, he says every credible media outlet has said that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=139.54s)]
*  this is fake. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=144.72s)]
*  This is a smear tactic. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=147.04s)]
*  This is Russian disinformation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=148.18s)]
*  If anyone cared at all about disinformation or integrity in our reporting in our elections, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=153.22s)]
*  every person associated with that spreading that lie would have been fired. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=159.14s)]
*  Everyone but not one person has because people want disinformation in these institutions [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  who claim that they oppose it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=167.94s)]
*  We've had media outlets confirm the authenticity and here as one of the best reporters on this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=170.11999999999998s)]
*  story, Miranda Devine, who actually works at the New York Post, noted yesterday in new [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=174.61999999999998s)]
*  court filing today, the DOJ confirms Hunter Biden's laptop is real, that he left it at [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=180.7s)]
*  a computer store and that the contents match what they obtained from a search warrant on [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=186.26s)]
*  his iCloud. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  Don't hold your breath for a retraction from Joe Biden, who said, quote, it's a Russian [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  plant. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=195.38s)]
*  The dirty 51, meeting the 51 intelligence agents who signed onto a letter endorsing [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  that lie, were myriad dishonest media operatives. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  They blamed Russia when the Bidens knew it was Hunter and so did the FBI. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=205.0s)]
*  And here's what the DOJ filing said. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  This is a DOJ filing a affidavit in the case of Hunter Biden's criminal investigation [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=212.5s)]
*  for a bunch of charges related to tax evasion and fraud and obtaining a gun license. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=219.86s)]
*  They filed a document in court saying the following, quote, while investigating the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=227.46s)]
*  defendants for tax violations, investigators obtained evidence showing his prior gun purchase [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=231.1s)]
*  was illegal because he was addicted to controlled substances. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=236.14s)]
*  Quote, in August 2019, IRS and FBI investigators obtained a search warrant for tax violations [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=239.34s)]
*  for the defendant's Apple iCloud account. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=245.78s)]
*  In response to that warrant, in September 2019, Apple produced backups of data from [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=248.62s)]
*  various of the defendant's electronic devices that he had backed up to his iCloud account. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=253.74s)]
*  Investigators also came into possession of the defendant's Apple MacBook Pro, which he [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  had left at a computer store. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=264.74s)]
*  A search warrant was also obtained for his laptop, and the results of the search were [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=267.5s)]
*  largely duplicative of information investigators had already obtained from Apple. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=271.06s)]
*  So not only did the FBI know that the laptop was authentic at a time when the CIA and former [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=276.42s)]
*  agents in the media and Twitter and Facebook were all saying it was Russian disinformation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=280.86s)]
*  and then banning it on that basis, but the story of how that laptop came into the possession, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=284.68s)]
*  first of that laptop owner and then ultimately to Rudy Giuliani, was exactly what the New [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=292.7s)]
*  York Post said that it was, which was that Hunter Biden had left it at a laptop store [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=298.06s)]
*  in Rhode Island, in Delaware rather, to be repaired and never went and picked it up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=302.82s)]
*  Every part of that New York Post story was true. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=307.3s)]
*  And yet, almost every media outlet, including the one to which I belonged at the time, The [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=310.86s)]
*  Intercept, ratified the CIA lie that this laptop was Russian disinformation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=314.14s)]
*  And to this very day, not a single one of them, even now that the Biden Justice Department [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=320.9s)]
*  is admitting that that whole thing was a lie, has retracted their story or confronted what [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=325.02s)]
*  they did. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=329.85999999999996s)]
*  I know I've talked about this before. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=330.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to talk about this again. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=332.73999999999995s)]
*  It is such irrefutable proof that these media outlets don't get stories wrong. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  They lie on purpose. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  They lie on purpose, and they work in conjunction with the U.S. security state to do so with [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=341.94s)]
*  the specific intent of manipulating the outcome of our elections. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=346.02s)]
*  If you don't think that's coming over the next nine months or 10 months, I don't know [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=349.46s)]
*  what to tell you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  We're going to have a lot of these kinds of manipulations and deceit, especially if Donald [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  Trump ends up as the nominee. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdmwqEnorg&t=360.21999999999997s)]
