**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0)
*  Here is this socialist communist champion of the working man Hassan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=0.0s)]
*  piker from his multi-million dollar mansion in Los Angeles that he has bought [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  with the many many millions of dollars he has squeezed out of this community [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  of people who follow him. Here he is on February 24th or just a couple of days [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=24.92s)]
*  ago explaining why his job is actually at least in some respects more difficult [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  than more trying than more socially and spiritually draining men and emotionally [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=38.32s)]
*  burdensome than the jobs of people who have ordinary jobs that make hourly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=42.8s)]
*  wages that have bosses that involve manual labor where they have to be at [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  work by a certain day of certain hour every day like nine to five or nine to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=53.28s)]
*  ten to six or ten to seven they take buses back and forth to their jobs they [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  have all kinds of layers of people telling them what to do according to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=62.36s)]
*  him he said his job in some respects is more burdensome and more difficult than [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  all of those people and here was his explanation for why. Yes a real job can [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=70.44s)]
*  be gruesome a real job can make you very tired but a real job doesn't suck the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=74.56s)]
*  soul out of you you know what I mean in the same way that nine hours of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  streaming absolutely will. So that was the accept of his stream that circulated [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=84.2s)]
*  it created a lot of anger and rage even among some people on the left because if [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  you're making seven million dollars a year that's my guess of what he's making [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=106.6s)]
*  maybe more and you basically just sit in front of your computer in your mansion [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=110.24s)]
*  and you stream whenever you want and you talk about whatever you want he spends a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=116.28s)]
*  lot of time just showing other people's videos without crediting them or [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  whatever he wants to do that's what he does and he makes an enormous amount of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  money and lives this life of an online celebrity it's probably not a good idea [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=127.24s)]
*  especially if you claim that you're a champion of the working person to go [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=130.48s)]
*  around talking about how difficult your job is as he did here now he claimed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=134.96s)]
*  this clip was out of context and didn't really show the full context of what he [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=140.4s)]
*  was saying so he and people on his staff began circulating what they said was the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=146.96s)]
*  fuller picture and I think a lot of people pointed out correctly that it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=152.0s)]
*  didn't make it any better if anything that made it any worse and you can see [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=156.8s)]
*  even though this is the clip they chose it begins obviously he's responding to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  people in his audience objecting to the things he said like what are you talking [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=163.58s)]
*  about what do you mean that there are some respects in which your job is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=168.94000000000003s)]
*  harder than the ordinary worker and here's what he said while responding to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  it this is again the clip they published that was designed to show what they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  claim is the fuller context of his comments no no no no no no social [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=181.38000000000002s)]
*  battery wise unless you're in retail unless you're in fucking retail it's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=188.48s)]
*  very different you're out of touch them I'm gonna die dude there's motherfuckers [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  who are accountants in here and they're misunderstanding what I'm saying a real [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  job does not expend your social battery in the same fucking way as someone who [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=202.12s)]
*  did a sales job a real job okay I'm telling you as someone who did did both [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=207.16s)]
*  like nine hours of of constant performance and people-pleasing taps [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=215.92s)]
*  you out from social scenarios after nine hours of that I could probably do fucking [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=224.68s)]
*  physical labor it would not bother me but I can't fucking do more social shit [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=229.24s)]
*  that's my point like there are obviously real jobs out there that are good [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  comparisons service sector people-pleasing jobs would be very similar [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=243.64s)]
*  those are like I think customer service type shit but like if you're an [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  accountant or if you're even like in sales my interactions with clients was [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  limited way more limited than like constantly having to do this for nine [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=259.28s)]
*  hours with like a back-and-forth interaction for nine hours that's what [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=264.12s)]
*  like sucks your your social battery and you just tap out after it yeah think [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=269.79999999999995s)]
*  about it this way like you give presentations for your job right imagine [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=279.0s)]
*  giving a presentation for a nine-hour straight it's like after a while you'd [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  be like I don't want to talk ever again now here's the thing I guess kind of in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=290.79999999999995s)]

*  nothing is free in life and I don't doubt in part from experience that if [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=329.52s)]
*  you have some sort of public platform that it's not always easy the problem is [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=335.32s)]
*  is that if you're making many millions of dollars a year by sitting your ass [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=339.12s)]

*  them what to say and have sold ending jobs just keep that to yourself that is [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEk9PzpbwD0&t=369.12s)]
