# Konstantin Kisin Attacks The "Woke Right" Without Realizing He's Part Of It
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg)
*  We do have a few questions and the first one comes from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=0.0s)]
*  Curl Malone and he asks, what do you think of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=10.08s)]
*  Constantine Kistin's response by declaring Tucker Carlson, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=13.52s)]
*  Candace Owens and maybe Dave Smith as the woke right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=16.8s)]
*  I'm so happy to have this question. Honestly, I was thinking about doing a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=23.6s)]
*  show on this. I just don't like doing segments about people who I [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=27.36s)]
*  don't think deserve full segments. It's a good way to get attention into [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=32.56s)]
*  that kind of conflict and controversy cells, but I just don't regard [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=37.28s)]
*  Constantine Kistin as sufficiently noteworthy to do like a waste of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=40.72s)]
*  segment on him. But since you asked, I'm so happy about it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  It's the most amazing thing, this idea of woke right that they're using. Now [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=51.6s)]
*  what's going on here is very obvious, extremely obvious, which is Constantine [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=55.28s)]
*  Kistin loves Israel. He's been a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=59.2s)]
*  Zionist since his youth, been taught to love Israel, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=63.92s)]
*  loves Israel and the people whom he's been targeting, particularly [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=67.04s)]
*  Tucker Carlson but also Candace Owens, have become [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=71.04s)]
*  targets of people on the right for the first time. Like a year and a half ago [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=74.48s)]
*  Constantine Kistin wouldn't dare utter a criticism of Tucker Carlson [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=78.48s)]
*  or Candace Owens. What has happened obviously that has changed that is that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=82.8s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens and Dave Smith [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=87.36s)]
*  have become critics of Israel, which is the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  gravest crime. Like whoever becomes a critic of Israel [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=94.56s)]
*  with any kind of meaningful influence has to be destroyed. Just like you saw [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  with Ta-Nehisi Coates, who by the way was given his first [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=101.12s)]
*  platform and hired by the Atlantic by Jeffrey Goldberg and at the time [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=106.0s)]
*  Ta-Nehisi Coates was pro-Israel, he was pro-Zionist and he actually wrote an [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=110.32s)]
*  article comparing the Zionist [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  trajectory to the attempt by black Americans to find their own [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  independence. So that's the reason he was welcomed at the Atlantic. I'm not [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  saying the only reason but it was obviously a prerequisite. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=128.4s)]
*  So imagine how Jeffrey Goldberg must feel. But anyway Constantine Kistin hates [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  Tucker Carlson now and does a lot of videos about why he's so evil and even [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  though it's under the pretense of all this other stuff the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=139.68s)]
*  obvious motivating factor is Tucker Carlson's questioning of Israel but more [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=142.16s)]
*  so like US support for Israel. And this is what amazes me so much is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  that the insult phrase that they have come up with to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  talk about Tucker and Candace is the woke right. And this is why it's so [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=156.96s)]
*  hilarious and such projection and so ironic [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=161.44s)]
*  because for years people like Constantine Kistin the only reason we [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=166.08s)]
*  know his name is he was part of that like anti-woke [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  faction that arose after Me Too but especially the Black Lives Matter [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=174.4s)]
*  protest like Barry Weiss. You know they all [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=177.84s)]
*  branded on like oh we're such heterodox thinkers we reject the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=180.8s)]
*  woke ideology of the left and the thing they hated most about the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  woke ideology of the left according to them was that it was all [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  based on victimhood it was all based on group identity it was all based on this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=195.52s)]
*  claim that the United States and the world [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  is filled with all kinds of bigotry and all kinds of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=204.8s)]
*  discrimination that is directed at Black people [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  or Muslims or women or trans people or whoever and this was all crybaby [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  behavior according to this anti-woke faction that emerged. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  This is just an all like a left-wing attempt to turn themselves into victims [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=224.64s)]
*  to whine constantly to claim that they were the victims of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  systemic discrimination that was what mostly the critics [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=233.04s)]
*  the critique of the woke left was was that it was like identity-based [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  victimhood narratives and at the same time that they were demanding [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=240.0s)]
*  to be shielded from ideas that they disliked based on the grounds that it [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=244.56s)]
*  made them unsafe and they that was mocked as being childlike. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  Okay now over the last year we have heard nothing like the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=251.12s)]
*  primary narrative has been from the pro-Israel right of which [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=258.24s)]
*  Constantine Kizun is a part exactly all the things that they have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=262.32s)]
*  claimed define the sinister parts of the woke [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=267.12s)]
*  left. Oh I'm the group of which I'm a member [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=270.0s)]
*  Jews are now the unique target of violent bigotry. We're the ones that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=275.04s)]
*  are the victims. We are unsafe. We need protections all [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=283.36s)]
*  we're not even safe to walk on the streets in Europe anymore because people [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=288.24s)]
*  hate us so much we we can't even go on campus because we [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=291.68s)]
*  hear these genocidal chants that need to be stopped [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  and the people on them need to be punished. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=297.92s)]
*  That's the woke right. The woke right are the people who [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=300.56s)]
*  believe that they who identify themselves as part of their demographic [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=304.24s)]
*  group in this case Jews and who have created this narrative that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=307.76s)]
*  comes exactly from the woke left that they've spent the last however many [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=310.72s)]
*  years mocking that their group is the true victim group [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  that their group is confronting this dangerous form of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=317.52s)]
*  hatred and and and prejudice and discrimination and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  bigotry that there's all these things going around around them that make them [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=324.72s)]
*  unsafe feeling unsafe on campuses they need more protection from [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=328.16s)]
*  administrators administrators should be fired for not acting to protect them [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=332.24s)]
*  enough to call critics of Israel the rope [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=336.16s)]
*  woke right is 180 degrees the opposite of the reality and the people that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=340.24s)]
*  are the ones that are constantly engaging in group-based self-discrimination [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=348.08s)]
*  and victimhood narratives namely since october 7th [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=352.56s)]
*  pro-israel Jews and their supporters are the ones that have been peddling [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=356.32s)]
*  what had been defined as the woke left the core ideas and tactics of the woke [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=361.28s)]
*  left forever the woke right are the constantine [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  kizans of the world who believe that oh it just so happens that the group into [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=368.4s)]
*  which i was born with which my most identified [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=373.52s)]
*  we're the real victim group these other guys when they do it [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=376.08s)]
*  it's just it's just whiny patchy land but this time [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  is actually this is the real bigotry against me and my group [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=382.96s)]
*  and that's the the the bigotry that the government and administrators need to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  act to protect which is also kind of what they're using even to talk about [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=391.04s)]
*  tennethesychosis as well so like oh his criticism about of israel now it's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=394.56s)]
*  because he's woke because he's always been [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=398.32s)]
*  woke whatever tennethesychosis and now it's also what they're using to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=400.8s)]
*  criticize him because i think it also like once you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  pit yourself as the anti-woke movement the only criticism that you can have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  to do to use against other people is woke right so well right and just two [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=413.6s)]
*  things about that is one is there it's not just that they've been [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=417.44s)]
*  whining about their own victimhood they have been a huge number of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=421.52s)]
*  censorship uh acts imposed in the name of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=426.4s)]
*  protecting this this group that they claim is uniquely victimized which just [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=431.04s)]
*  so happens to be their own all this stuff the de platforming [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=434.72s)]
*  de platforming getting people fired en masse for criticizing israel [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=438.0s)]

*  radically expands the definition of anti-semitism to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=445.84s)]
*  include all sorts of very uh classically protected political [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=449.2s)]
*  ideas that are designed to put off limits uh criticism israel [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=453.44s)]

*  mock it when it comes from every other group that they don't care about [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=506.8s)]
*  and believe it's you know concocted and trivial and whiny and petulant [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=510.48s)]
*  but their group is the real victimized marginalized endangered group [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=515.76s)]
*  even though they occupy so many positions of power which is why there's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=520.48s)]
*  so much censorship in on their behalf it's just that has been one of the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=523.6s)]
*  biggest ironies just to watch them call the others [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=528.08s)]
*  we're critical of israel the woke right when in in fact these are the people who [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=531.12s)]
*  who use the defining elements of woke ism to define their entire world view [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  and to constantly turn themselves into victims and it's also kind of remarkable [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=540.0s)]
*  how so much of that anti-woke movement that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  emerged post 2020 has embraced the pro israel as [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=547.84s)]
*  almost exclusively almost all of them except tucker and kandace and these [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  people need to be singled out and excluded which is why [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=558.48s)]
*  which is why they're they're getting they're not being called the woke right [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=561.28s)]
*  to discredit them yeah and this is the reality too is that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=564.0s)]
*  the reason this anti-woke movement became so powerful and such an [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=567.6s)]
*  obsession you know like why are you so concerned with [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  like ideas on college campus if you go back and look at [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=576.64s)]
*  sheldon nadelson and and mary middelson and who they were funding [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=580.24s)]
*  and what the israeli government and the groups that it funds [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=584.32s)]
*  or that act on its behalf have been warning about way before october [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=587.6s)]
*  uh seven like going back into the you know [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  two 2010s they understood that one of the biggest threats to israel [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=595.12s)]
*  was that there was too much anti israel and pro-palestinian sentiment emerging [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=601.2s)]
*  on college campuses and they were petrified by it because [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=607.52s)]
*  paradise has been carrying that banner for a long for a long time ever since she [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  was in in college and she tried to get professors fired [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=615.28s)]
*  who she thought was too critical of israel [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=618.48s)]
*  and so what this anti-woke movement really was [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=620.88s)]
*  it was masquerading as some sort of principal defense of free speech [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=624.24s)]
*  or not when in reality what it was was it was in large part not entirely but in [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  large part driven by this contempt for the dominant [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  ideology in american campuses because that dominant ideology included [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  so much anti-israel criticism and so much pro-palestinian movement [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=643.76s)]
*  and even the thing they feared most was the boycott divestment and sanctions [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=647.36s)]
*  movement which was modeled on the the college [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=650.56s)]
*  movement that helped bring down the south african [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=653.84s)]
*  apartheid regime and the israeli government and its servants and loyalists [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=656.4s)]
*  in the united states understood that colleges and the ideology and free [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=660.24s)]
*  speech and organizing on colleges was one of the main threats to uh to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=664.56s)]
*  israeli interest and they needed a way obviously they [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=670.16s)]
*  couldn't come out and admit that that was what they really cared most about [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=672.96s)]
*  so they created this kind of anti-woke movement to attack [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=675.84s)]
*  uh this this left-wing ideology on campus [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=679.2s)]
*  in part in large part because they perceived it as a threat to israel which [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=683.76s)]
*  is why as you say all these people not all but most who [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=686.96s)]
*  built their careers and who only became even known by [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=690.96s)]
*  purporting to oppose woke ideology and raising the banner of free speech [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=696.88s)]
*  have turned on a dime since october 7th but the reason they were so focused on [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=701.68s)]
*  college campuses in the first place was because the israeli government and [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=705.68s)]
*  israeli billionaires and activists understood that what was [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=710.7199999999999s)]
*  happening on colleges was one of the main threats to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=714.7199999999999s)]
*  the zionist interests and you can just go find our mainstream articles where [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39AnLVxdtXg&t=717.12s)]
