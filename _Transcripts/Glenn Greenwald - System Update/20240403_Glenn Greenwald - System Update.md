# â€œSystematic and Deliberate." Israel Strikes Aid Convoy
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc)
*  It's not just the Israeli war in Gaza that is starting to unravel out of control, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=0.0s)]
*  it's not just the high possibility of further escalation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=14.16s)]
*  The United States is already involved in the Middle East in multiple ways because of Israel, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=17.68s)]
*  including bombing alleged Iranian targets in Iraq and Syria, as well as bombing targets [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=21.6s)]
*  in Yemen as retaliation for the Houthis targeting commercial shipping to retaliate against the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=27.68s)]
*  Israeli attack on Gaza. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=33.28s)]
*  The United States is involved in multiple ways in the Middle East since October 7th, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=34.28s)]
*  as well as funding the Israeli war and providing them with the weapons. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=38.72s)]
*  But Israel seems increasingly willing to deviate from every standard, to defy every limit, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=43.04s)]
*  to trespass every ethical line, essentially in order to demonstrate that they're unconstrained [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=53.36s)]
*  entirely, that nothing can limit what the Israelis do. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=59.6s)]
*  And the fact that the United States government and many factions within the United States [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=63.12s)]
*  and the West more broadly continue to defend everything Israel does, even when, as happened [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=68.84s)]
*  yesterday, the Israelis kill an innocent citizen of the United States, an American citizen [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=73.88s)]
*  using American weapons to do it in ways that are blatantly unjustified, that have sparked [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=80.24s)]
*  rage throughout the world, including in the countries that have stood by Israel most closely. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=86.52s)]
*  Even when the Israelis kill our own citizens, it seems like our government is willing to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=92.2s)]
*  justify and excuse everything that they do and continue to pledge further support. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=98.12s)]
*  Now yesterday we went over just how extreme of an act it was for the Israelis to target [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=103.6s)]
*  the Iranian embassy in Damascus. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=109.32s)]
*  In general, countries, virtually without limits, respect the inviolability of embassies, and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=113.0s)]
*  for no other reason than they're central to the way that countries protect themselves. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=119.36s)]
*  If the Iranian embassy in Damascus is now fair game, then obviously Israeli embassies [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=125.84s)]
*  around the world, American embassies, would be as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=131.64s)]
*  That's why it's almost impossible to find examples, even extreme ones, where countries [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=135.0s)]
*  really wanted to invade embassies and yet chose not to, and yet the Israelis blew past [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=140.76s)]
*  all of the conventions, like the Vienna Convention, that make embassies sacrosanct, part of the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=145.72s)]
*  foreign soil of those countries whose embassy it is, and bombed the Iranian embassy in Syria, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=150.6s)]
*  almost forcing the Iranians to retaliate in a way that brings serious risk of escalation, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=157.24s)]
*  not just for Israel but for the United States as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=161.64s)]
*  But the act that has really turned even parts of the world that have been willing to overlook [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=164.92s)]
*  what the Israelis were doing in terms of using mass starvation and famine as a weapon of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=172.16s)]
*  war in Gaza, have turned a lot of people, if not entirely against Israel, certainly angrier [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  at Halabib than they've ever been, which was this attack on an A convoy from the world [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  central kitchen, and even the version given by the IDF is reprehensible, even if you believe [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=189.36s)]
*  everything the Israeli military is saying about what happened here, it is morally and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  legally reprehensible. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  Here from the Israeli daily newspaper that have a lot of sources inside the Israeli government [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  from April 2nd, which is today, the IDF drone bombed the world's central kitchen aid convoy [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  three times, targeting an armed Hamas member who wasn't there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=218.8s)]
*  So that's the Israeli excuse, that they knew they were bombing a convoy of aid workers [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=224.52s)]
*  from the world's central kitchen, which the Israelis say are free to operate in Gaza, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=230.12s)]
*  are welcomed in Gaza, they knew they were bombing that convoy, they're not pretending [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=233.96s)]
*  they thought this was a Hamas convoy, but their argument was, well the reason we did [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  it is because we thought mistakenly as it turns out that among the seven workers was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=243.88s)]
*  a single armed militant from Hamas, and therefore we decided to kill them all, all seven of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=248.24s)]
*  them just to kill this one armed Hamas operative, which who, whoops, wasn't there, but even [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=255.24s)]
*  if he were, how would that be justification for extinguishing the lives of seven international [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  aid workers in Gaza with the Israeli permission to feed the starving civilians there? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=266.64s)]
*  Now again, if I were an aid worker in Gaza, given the anarchy in Gaza that has been brought [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=272.4s)]
*  about by the destruction of civilian life and infrastructure in Gaza, I would probably [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=294.64s)]
*  want somebody armed accompanying me, but even if they had taken an armed person, even [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=298.28s)]
*  one associated with Hamas, how in the world would that justify from any moral perspective [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=305.55999999999995s)]
*  or legal perspective of war killing everyone in that vicinity? Yet that's exactly what [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=311.08s)]
*  they did on purpose, quote, the Israeli strike that killed seven world's central kitchen [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  aid workers in the Gaza Strip on Monday night was launched because of suspicion that a terrorist [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  was traveling with the convoy. According to the defense sources, the cars were clearly [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=327.24s)]
*  marked on the roof and side as belonging to the organization. Again, this is according [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  to the IDF, they're admitting that the cars were clearly marked as belonging to this organization [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=336.56s)]
*  that is founded by the celebrity chef Jose Andres that, who actually came out and supported [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli war in Gaza in the beginning, and now has decided that his organization, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=352.44s)]
*  which works in war zones, needs to feed the people in Gaza, and he's worked with the Israeli [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=357.08s)]
*  military to be able to operate there. And the Israeli military is admitting that they [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=360.84s)]
*  knew this was an aid convoy and yet just tried it anyway, quote, the war room of the unit [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  responsible for security of the route that the convoy traveled identified an armed man [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=370.64s)]
*  on the truck and suspected that he was a terrorist. At some point when the convoy was driving [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  along the approved route, the war room of the unit responsible for security of the route [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=381.02s)]
*  ordered the drone operators to attack one of the cars with a missile. Some of the passengers [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=384.62s)]
*  were seen leaving the car after it was hit and switching to one of the other two cars. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=390.02s)]
*  They continued to drive and even notified the people responsible that they were attacked, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=396.0s)]
*  but seconds later another missile hit their car. The third car in the convoy approached [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  and the passengers began to transfer to it the wounded who had survived the second strike [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=406.98s)]
*  in order to get them out of danger, but then a third missile struck them. All seven World [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=411.26s)]
*  Central Kitchen volunteers were killed in the strike. Think how systematic and deliberate [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=417.65999999999997s)]
*  that was. They knew this was a convoy traveling on a route that the IDF had approved. When [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=423.28s)]
*  they hit the first car of the World Health Kitchen, the drivers in the car, the people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  in the car, the volunteers called the Israeli military, their contacts in the IDF, and said [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=443.0s)]
*  that missile just attacked our convoy. And despite that when they moved to the second [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  car, the IDF then targeted that second car and struck it, killing some of the people. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=451.28s)]
*  The ones who were wounded tried to scramble into the third car to get into safety and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=456.52s)]
*  once they got there, the IDF then targeted the third car and killed them all. Three of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=461.14s)]
*  the people killed were British nationals, one was an American citizen. You would think [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=467.96s)]
*  the US government would be enraged that one of its own citizens, an innocent person by [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=474.76s)]
*  even the IDF's acknowledgement, was killed using weapons and munitions and drones and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=479.28s)]
*  bombs paid for by the American government, possibly supplied by the American government [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=485.56s)]
*  itself. And it's not the first time the Israelis have killed an innocent American over the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=489.48s)]
*  last year. They killed an American journalist in Gaza last year before October 7th. They [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=494.48s)]
*  killed an American teenager in the West Bank within the last two months. Now they've killed [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=499.36s)]
*  an American aid worker trying to look a refuge to the people of Gaza. And yet the White House, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=503.88s)]
*  the Biden White House, when asked about this today, did everything possible to defend the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=509.68s)]
*  Israelis, saying that there's no evidence they violated any laws of war, there's no [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=514.64s)]
*  evidence they violated any human rights limitations, and they repeated their refusal to put any [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=519.08s)]
*  limits of any kind on what Israel can do as the United States continues to pay for its [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=526.36s)]
*  war and to provide it with the weapons that it uses. This is a war that the United States [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=533.16s)]
*  is every bit as much responsible for as Israel because the US refuses even to put any limits [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=536.84s)]
*  on the Israelis of any kind. In fact, yesterday, as CNN reported, the Biden administration [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=542.92s)]
*  is set to green light an $18 billion sale of more F-15 fighter jets to Israel. Remember, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=549.64s)]
*  we reported a couple of weeks ago that the Biden administration told the NetNav government [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  that invading and attacking Ra'a, the refugee camp where most Palestinians are now taking [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=561.64s)]
*  refuge, is a quote, red line that the United States would not tolerate. And the Israelis [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  said, we don't care about your red lines, we're going to do it anyway. And the US response [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=572.36s)]
*  was then to turn around and sell a massive amount of F-15 fighter jets to the Israelis. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=575.64s)]
*  Quote, the Biden administration is close to approving the sale of as many 50 American [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=583.04s)]
*  made F-15 fighter jets to Israel, an ideal expected to be worth more than $18 billion, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=588.76s)]
*  according to three people familiar with the matter. The transaction would amount to the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=593.88s)]
*  largest US foreign military sale to Israel since the country went to war on October 7th [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=598.32s)]
*  with Hamas and comes as the administration is also expected to notify Congress of a large [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=604.12s)]
*  new sale of precision guided ammunition kits to Israel. The new sales of some of the US's [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=609.6400000000001s)]
*  most sophisticated weaponry underscores the extent to which the US continues to support [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=615.6400000000001s)]
*  Israel militarily. Even as Biden administration officials criticize Israel's operations in [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  Gaza, which have killed more than 32,000 Palestinians since October, according to the Gaza Ministry [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=626.96s)]
*  of Health. Now, the US government's position is that number is likely undercounted because [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=633.28s)]
*  it only counts bodies that go through the morgue and not the people buried still underneath [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=638.28s)]
*  the rubble, which is a substantial number of people killed. The situation in Gaza gets [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=642.36s)]
*  worse, Israel's conduct gets worse, the American government ties itself to Israel ever more [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=648.2s)]
*  risking further escalation in the Middle East. And at the same time, the war in Ukraine is [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=654.56s)]
*  still raging on. Remember that. And now the US looks ready to involve itself even further [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=659.16s)]
*  in that war. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXHdFAIJgc&t=665.0799999999999s)]
