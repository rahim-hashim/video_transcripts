# How Zohran Beat the NYC Democratic Establishment
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ)
*  Now, let me show you the counterattack, the way they thought the Andrew Cuomo's of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  world thought they were going to sabotage him. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=10.58s)]
*  It's an amazing thing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=13.02s)]
*  This is the New York mayoral debate. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=14.24s)]
*  There were, I think, seven candidates, eight candidates on the stage, and it was hosted [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=16.06s)]
*  by the local NBC News affiliate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=22.44s)]
*  And just listen to this question that they thought was important for people wanting to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=24.84s)]
*  be New York City mayor to answer and how they all answered it except for Zoran. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=29.32s)]
*  Mr. Cuomo? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=33.28s)]
*  Given the hostility and the anti-Semitism that has been shown in New York, I would give [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=34.28s)]
*  I don't know why we don't have the question, but the first the question there is, if you're [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=40.0s)]
*  elected, what would be your first foreign visit as mayor? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=44.64s)]
*  Which foreign country would you visit first? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=48.32s)]
*  Gee, I wonder what they're trying to get them to say. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Which one might it be? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=51.7s)]
*  Because like in Nigeria, Norway, maybe Uruguay, probably Israel, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=52.7s)]
*  That's certainly how they all interpreted it except Zoran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=58.24s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  Cuomo? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  Given the hostility and the anti-Semitism that has been shown in New York, I would go [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Tilson, where would you go? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'd make my fourth trip to Israel followed by my fifth trip to Ukraine, two of our greatest [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=69.6s)]
*  allies fighting on the front lines of the global war on terror. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Mamdani? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  I would stay in New York City. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  My plans are to address New Yorkers across the five boroughs and focus on that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=81.86s)]
*  Mr. Mamdani, can I just jump in? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Would you visit Israel as mayor? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=87.64s)]
*  I will be doing as the mayor. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=90.6s)]
*  I'll be standing up for Jewish New Yorkers and I'll be meeting them wherever they are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=92.28s)]
*  across the five boroughs, whether that's in their synagogues and temples or at their homes [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=95.0s)]
*  or at the subway platform, because ultimately we need to focus on delivering on their concerns. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=99.48s)]
*  And just yes or no, do you believe in a Jewish state of Israel? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=104.44s)]
*  I believe Israel has the right to exist. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=107.5s)]
*  Not as a Jewish state? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  No, as a state with equal rights. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  He won't say it has the right to exist. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=113.0s)]
*  And his answer was no, he won't visit Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=115.36s)]
*  That's what he was trying to say. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=118.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=120.64s)]
*  Unlike you, I answer questions very directly. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=121.64s)]
*  I want to be very clear. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=123.64s)]
*  I believe every state should be a state of equal rights. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=127.12s)]
*  So do you see how excited Andrew Cuomo got? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=128.12s)]
*  He really did base a huge part of his campaign on his loyalty to Israel, his love of Israel, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=131.72s)]
*  his longtime support for Israel, his father's support for Israel, his family's support for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=136.56s)]
*  Israel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=140.36s)]
*  And you heard those voters that voted for Trump when asked why. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=142.28s)]
*  Did any of them say, oh, I think Democrats are insufficiently pro-Israel? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=148.24s)]
*  No, no one said that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=151.44s)]
*  These people aren't waking up and thinking, I want to make sure my mayor is going to go [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=152.88s)]
*  to Israel as the very first foreign visit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=156.36s)]
*  It was supposed to be controversial that he said, look, I'm the New York City mayor. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=159.44s)]
*  That's what I'm running for. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=163.36s)]
*  Not the Secretary of State. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=164.36s)]
*  I'm not thinking about foreign trips. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=167.0s)]
*  I'm actually wanting to represent the people of New York City. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=168.56s)]
*  I'm going to stay here at home and talk to the people I'm supposed to be working for. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=170.4s)]
*  Why would I plan my overseas trips and make sure Israel is for... [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=176.44s)]
*  A lot of them said Israel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=180.12s)]
*  One of them said, oh, the Holy Land, Israel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=182.0s)]
*  So that was supposed to be the kind of thing that they thought was going to sabotage. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  And they have these old ideas in their head about what you can and can't do. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=187.28s)]
*  That's why Trump won, too. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=191.4s)]
*  He broke all of those rules that people thought were still valid, and he proved they weren't. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=192.4s)]
*  Now just a couple of things here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=199.0s)]
*  First of all, I think one important part of what's driving all this, because the thing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=202.08s)]
*  is if you want to win in the Democratic primary in New York City, you can't just rely on left [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=205.76s)]
*  wing voters like DSA, Democratic Socialist of America, AOC, Bernie types. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=210.58s)]
*  That can give you a certain momentum, a certain energy, but you're not going to win a citywide [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=217.2s)]
*  race just with those kind of voters. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  You have to attract a lot of normie liberal Democrats. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=224.2s)]
*  That's who lives in New York City. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=227.16s)]
*  They're not people who hate Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  These are not them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  There are some, like Brooklyn and Queens, but the majority of Democrats in New York [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  City, most liberal American cities, are very normal Democrats. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  They love the Democratic establishment. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=244.12s)]
*  They love Pelosi, Chuck Schumer. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=245.52s)]
*  Chuck Schumer represents New York and has forever. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=248.12s)]
*  That's who they like. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=251.0s)]
*  You need to attract those voters. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=252.0s)]
*  I think one of the main reasons he attracted so many of those voters as well as the left [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=255.44s)]
*  wing base is that when you look at the approval rating for the Democratic party, it's like [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=260.4s)]
*  20%, 23%. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=265.08s)]
*  Republicans say, oh look, they're more unpopular than any party, and it's true. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=266.08s)]
*  But a lot of the reason for that is that Democrats themselves are telling posters that they don't [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=270.24s)]
*  approve of the Democratic party. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=275.24s)]
*  They've become convinced that the Democratic party has this kind of aged, stagnant, listless, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=278.2s)]
*  slow, uninteresting leadership base, and it's true. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=286.2s)]
*  It's basically a geriatocracy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=291.28s)]
*  And obviously, the debacle with Biden underscored that more than anything. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=292.28s)]
*  They were being told that they would get behind someone who was suffering from dementia. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=295.32s)]
*  And so they want this kind of new energy, this exciting energy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  That's a big part of it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=305.98s)]
*  It was kind of a referendum on what Democrats want their party to be. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=306.98s)]
*  They don't want to be voting for a 67-year-old person in politics for 40 years who has billionaire [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  money behind him as part of the Democratic establishment who was in the Clinton cabinet, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=316.38s)]
*  have Bill Clinton kind of come in from wherever he is and be like, yeah, I'm endorsing Andrew [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  Cuomo. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=325.94s)]
*  That's not appealing to these Democrats anymore. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=327.86s)]
*  They know that they can't keep going down that road. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  So that's part of it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  I really think a big part of it is that the primary division, not just in American politics, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=334.9s)]
*  but politics throughout the democratic world, certainly something we've talked a lot about [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=342.56s)]
*  before, is the difference between someone perceived to be part of the establishment [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=345.38s)]
*  and someone who seems to be an outsider who hates the establishment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=349.74s)]
*  There are a lot of people in the United States, millions, who voted twice for President Obama [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  in 2008, 2012, who then voted for Donald Trump in 2016. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=360.58s)]
*  That's a reason why Trump won. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=364.85999999999996s)]
*  And people who continue to cling to this archaic, obsolete way of understanding American politics, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=367.62s)]
*  whether it's about left versus right, conservative versus socialist, whatever, they can't process that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=372.21999999999997s)]
*  In 2016, there were a lot of people who were saying to reporters, my two favorite candidates [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=379.14s)]
*  are Trump and Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=384.56s)]
*  And again, same thing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=386.74s)]
*  If you think everything's right versus left, you're like, what are these people? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=387.74s)]
*  Crazy? That makes no sense. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=389.94s)]
*  But when you see that things are about hatred for the establishment, a desire to reject [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=392.26s)]
*  establishment candidates and vote for outsiders who seem anti-establishment, you understand [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=397.54s)]
*  why Obama won. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=401.76s)]
*  Against first Hillary Clinton and then John McCain. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=404.52s)]
*  This very young, previously utterly obscure black man with a Muslim-sounding name. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=406.74s)]
*  That's very improbable. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=417.34s)]
*  Yet he won because he presented him, I'm going to change the way Washington works, we're [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=420.17999999999995s)]
*  going to change for whom it works. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=423.29999999999995s)]
*  That was his whole appeal. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=424.58s)]
*  Whereas of course, John McCain or Hillary Clinton could credibly claim that and he rolled [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=425.58s)]
*  over them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=429.26s)]
*  Same with Mitt Romney. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=430.26s)]
*  And then in 2016, the outsider candidate besides Bernie Sanders, who probably would have gotten [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=431.26s)]
*  the nomination of the DNC, cheated, was Donald Trump. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=435.05999999999995s)]
*  This is the through line of American politics. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=437.62s)]
*  And in 2024, you first had Biden, then you had Kamala, just two completely insecure, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=442.22s)]
*  uninteresting, clinging to a script, using strategists, talking points and plans to win [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  the election without a single passionate view or thought of their own. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  And Zerran Madani is obviously an outsider candidate. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=462.42s)]
*  Very unknown, very young, doesn't speak like those other candidates, certainly doesn't [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=466.3s)]
*  speak like Andrew Cuomo, doesn't have billionaire backing, is highly critical on a fundamental [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=471.74s)]
*  level of the political establishment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  That's a major reason why he won as well. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=478.66s)]
*  And then I really believe that one of the things that was like Trump's superpower was, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=482.5s)]
*  as I said, that he didn't care that things he was saying were supposedly disqualifying. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=487.70000000000005s)]
*  He wouldn't retract them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=494.3s)]
*  I remember in 2015 when he had a pretty sizable lead, people were shocked by it, but they [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=495.62s)]
*  thought, oh, it's just early. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=500.66s)]
*  This is the kind of voter, the kind of candidate Republicans flirt with but won't actually [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=502.82000000000005s)]
*  vote for. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  They're going to snap it to line at the end and vote for Jeb Bush. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=507.46000000000004s)]
*  And in 2015, he gave an interview that's now notorious where he said, when asked about [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=511.74s)]
*  John McCain, who never liked Trump, and he was asked about his heroism and Trump said, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=520.14s)]
*  I don't know that he's not heroic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=526.34s)]
*  He got captured and crashed plane and got captured. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=527.58s)]
*  I prefer soldiers and heroes who don't get captured. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=531.58s)]
*  I think that's what makes you a winner. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=534.7800000000001s)]
*  And I remember the outpouring of articles over the next few days from all the deans [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=537.6600000000001s)]
*  of political reporting or whatever saying, okay, that's the end of Trump's campaign. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=541.58s)]
*  You can't criticize John McCain. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=547.14s)]
*  And of course, they went to him, do you apologize? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=550.82s)]
*  And he said, no, I don't apologize. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=551.82s)]
*  They meant every word I said. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=552.82s)]
*  And there were so many things like that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=554.1s)]
*  Mocking the New York Times reporter has cerebral palsy, or I believe it was that some sort [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=556.46s)]
*  of degenerative disease. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=560.86s)]
*  Over and over and over, the Access Hollywood stuff. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=564.6600000000001s)]
*  And his refusal to renounce his own statements, actions, and beliefs made him seem more genuine. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=567.7s)]
*  Even if people don't like the things he had said, the fact that he's saying, no, that's [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=575.82s)]
*  what I believe all those are going to say, that is a big political asset. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=579.1s)]
*  And the fact that Zoran, who has a long history of passionate activism in opposition to Israeli [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=582.62s)]
*  aggression, Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Israeli assaults on Gaza, when he would [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=592.4200000000001s)]
*  say things like globalizing Intifada, which he did, and he was confronted about that a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=599.0200000000001s)]
*  month before the election, and he's like, are you going to withdraw that? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=604.98s)]
*  He's like, no, I'm not going to withdraw that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  People distort what that means. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=610.7800000000001s)]
*  They try and make it seem like it means you believe in terrorists, like killing people [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=611.78s)]
*  with car bombs. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  It's just a word, Intifada, an Arabic word for struggle or resistance, including peaceful [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=616.4599999999999s)]
*  struggle and resistance, for equal rights for the Palestinians. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=622.66s)]
*  And again, a lot of people may not like that term. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=626.38s)]
*  A lot of people don't like that term, but I think the fact that he was not running away [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=629.62s)]
*  from it, not apologizing for it, ran a pretty unique campaign, as I'm trying to show you, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=633.06s)]
*  is also a major reason that he won. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=641.74s)]
*  And I just think, again, populism is nothing more than there's this system over here of [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=643.38s)]
*  powerful people, politically powerful, financially powerful people. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=647.86s)]
*  They do not have your interest in mind. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=651.42s)]
*  They don't care about you. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=652.82s)]
*  They're exploiting you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=653.82s)]
*  They're abusing you for their own aggrandizement, their own wealth, their own power. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=654.82s)]
*  And I want to fight them on your behalf. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=659.34s)]
*  That's what economic populism is. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=662.26s)]
*  Go look at what Josh Hawley does, threatening to vote against Trump's bill because it cuts [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=664.42s)]
*  Medicaid, knowing that a lot of Trump voters or class voters rely on Medicaid. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=668.5s)]
*  Something really interesting about Josh Hawley, under the radar, every week he holds House [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=673.78s)]
*  hearings, Senate hearings, and he summons executives of all kinds of industries, airlines [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=679.78s)]
*  industry, meat industry, bankers, and he just pounds them about like hidden fees or like [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=685.9s)]
*  gigantic executive pay given abusive consumers. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=695.26s)]
*  And Josh Hawley has said the future of the Republican Party is a multiracial working [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=701.6999999999999s)]
*  class coalition, a working class coalition, which requires economic populism. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=704.54s)]
*  He stood with Bernie, Josh Hawley did, to stop the COVID bill from being passed and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=711.4599999999999s)]
*  they were going to give out billions and billions of dollars to big business. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  And he demanded that there be direct payments to all Americans and they got the bill, they [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=720.46s)]
*  tried to stop the bill and it went to, they got $600 direct payment to Americans. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=727.22s)]
*  That's economic populism. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=734.1s)]
*  And then it went to Trump and Trump said $600 is enough, I'm vetoing it, I want $2,000 payments. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=736.22s)]
*  Promising to represent the forgotten person. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=744.38s)]
*  That's what populism is, economic populism. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=748.38s)]
*  Not serving Wall Street, not serving bankers, not serving real estate developers, not endorsing [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=750.4599999999999s)]
*  establishment dogma, not tying yourself to old, staid, decaying people who've just been [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=756.66s)]
*  around for decades who interest and excite nobody any longer. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=764.0999999999999s)]
*  That's the goal of American politics. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=768.66s)]
*  I don't think it matters at all to people if it comes from the right or the left. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=769.9399999999999s)]
*  And the lots of things about Zeron, Marjorie Taylor Greene today posted the Statute of [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=776.38s)]
*  Liberty in a burka, Ari Fleischer said, New York Jews, you need to evacuate. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=779.94s)]
*  You know, as he's a sub-kind of nation, as I said before, of like Joseph Stalin and Osama [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=785.3s)]
*  bin Laden. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=790.54s)]
*  You look at him, do you think, is that at all what he reads as, what he codes as, what [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=791.54s)]
*  seems a convincing attack on him? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  And so I think there's a lot of lessons here, not just for the Democratic Party though, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=801.1s)]
*  certainly a number of what American voters respond to and what they don't. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=805.54s)]
*  And in this case, the lessons are so powerful, so penetrating that it drove the unlikeliest [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=809.3s)]
*  of people to crush one of the most powerful political dynasties in America, the Cuomos, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=818.6999999999999s)]
*  backed by every institutional advantage you could want. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=827.66s)]
*  And very poised to, I'm not saying it's certain, but highly likely to become what a lot of [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=832.6600000000001s)]
*  people have long said is the second most important position in American politics, which is the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=836.9s)]
*  mayor of New York City. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=841.38s)]
*  New York City obviously is the center of American finance, American wealth, massive tourism, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=843.98s)]
*  gigantic city. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=850.98s)]
*  And so that is an important position, that's not a joke. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=852.62s)]
*  And the fact that a 33-year-old Muslim, self-identified democratic socialist was able to win, and [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=857.34s)]
*  despite that history of statements, I think it's very important to derive a lot of lessons [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=862.7399999999999s)]
*  from that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=868.3s)]
*  And I think anyone interested in understanding politics, let alone winning elections, would [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=869.3s)]
*  be studying him in a very non-judgmental way. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=872.8199999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you hate him, it doesn't matter if you like him, love him, the lessons [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=875.2199999999999s)]
*  ought to be the same. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ni3pmMSUQ&t=878.3399999999999s)]
