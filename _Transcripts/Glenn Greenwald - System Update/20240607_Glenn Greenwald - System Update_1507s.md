# Former Trump Aide Steve Bannon's Unprecedented Prison Sentence Explained
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk)
*  After I first began writing about politics in late 2005, within the next couple of years, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=0.0s)]
*  one of the issues on which I focused most, which I talked about most often, was how there [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=12.24s)]
*  was a two-tiered justice system in the United States where financial elites and especially [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=17.28s)]
*  political elites are largely immunized from the rule of law. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=21.6s)]
*  And oftentimes this is taking place in the controversy over many obvious illegal programs [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=26.52s)]
*  that the Bush and Cheney administration have adopted in the name of war on terror, torturing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=32.2s)]
*  detainees, kidnapping off the streets of Europe and sending them with no due process to Syria [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  or to Egypt to be tortured, spying on American citizens without the warrants required by [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=41.0s)]
*  law. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=45.64s)]
*  These were all crimes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=46.64s)]
*  And when Barack Obama ran in 2008, he was often asked whether he believes that those [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=48.0s)]
*  crimes should be prosecuted. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=52.84s)]
*  And he always gave the same answer, which is absolutely nobody's above the law. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  And one of the first things I'm going to do when I win is direct my attorney general to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=57.92s)]
*  investigate whether crimes were committed there and whether or not there should be prosecutions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=61.28s)]
*  And yet the minute he got into office, the media started haranguing him that you don't [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=66.12s)]
*  go and prosecute your political adversaries in the United States. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=71.72s)]
*  You don't go and prosecute prior administrations. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  This is only done in banana republics, not in the United States. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=76.64s)]
*  And my argument always was, well, what if they actually did commit crimes? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=81.56s)]
*  What if the prior administration actually committed crimes? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=85.56s)]
*  What if your political adversaries committed crimes? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=87.38s)]
*  Are they supposed to be exempt from the same rule of law that applies to all other citizens? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  So if now this were a case where that prohibition, that consensus that has long existed in Washington [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=93.66s)]
*  by the media and politicians, that you don't go and prosecute your political adversaries [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  or the prior administration, if that were being really lifted permanently because people in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=105.44s)]
*  media and journalism and politics realized it were wrong, I'd be the first to applaud. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=109.0s)]
*  That's not what's happening here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=114.64s)]
*  Another issue that I've been long talking about is how journalism is corrupt when it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=116.88s)]
*  does nothing more than say the Republicans say this, the Democrats say this, and it's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=120.84s)]
*  not up for us to decide. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=124.4s)]
*  We're just going to report what officials say in the U.S. government. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=125.4s)]
*  We're not going to tell you if it's true or false. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=128.8s)]
*  And so when the media started after Trump saying, oh, we're going to start calling him [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=131.44s)]
*  all the time, I would also be cheering if it really meant an abandonment of that kind [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=135.96s)]
*  of lazy journalism, that kind of corrupting journalism where you don't investigate what [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=140.36s)]
*  powerful people claim you just report it and mimic it and then leave it at that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  But again, this practice is only for Trump. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=149.56s)]
*  You will never hear of them saying those kind of things about Joe Biden or Democratic Party [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=152.38s)]
*  officials or really anyone else. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=155.52s)]
*  So this isn't a form of progress or evolution in how we understand things. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=157.68s)]
*  This is obviously the political persecution and the judicial and legal persecution of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=162.66s)]
*  Trump and his closest allies, not in the name of equal justice for all, but solely in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=168.38s)]
*  name of weaponizing the judicial system against a political movement that they regard with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  great fear that they do anything and will do anything to stop, including abusing the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=179.16s)]
*  legal system. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=184.04s)]
*  Here from the Wall Street Journal earlier today on the Steve Bannon case, quote, Steve [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=185.04s)]
*  Bannon ordered to report to prison on contempt of Congress conviction. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=188.38s)]
*  Former Trump advisor was convicted in 2022 and recently lost an appeal, quote, a federal [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=193.14s)]
*  judge Thursday ordered Steve Bannon to surrender by July 1st to serve a four month prison sentence [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=197.22s)]
*  for defying the House committee that investigated the January 6th, 2021 Capitol attack and former [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=202.98s)]
*  President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=208.46s)]
*  In a unanimous decision last month, a three judge appellate court panel rejected Bannon's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=213.18s)]
*  argument that his conviction wasn't valid because he was following his legal, his lawyers [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  advice when he refused to comply with the House subpoena demanding documents and testimony. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  The panel said Bannon's advice of counsel defense wasn't valid in contempt of Congress [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=227.54s)]
*  cases and would impede the legislative legislature's investigative authority. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  Bannon was the first of two former Trump White House officials to face prosecution for denying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=237.54s)]
*  the House panel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=241.78s)]
*  A year after Bannon's conviction, former Trump advisor Peter Navarro was found guilty of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=243.45999999999998s)]
*  defying the same committee, the January 6th committee, and was also later sentenced to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=247.61999999999998s)]
*  four months in prison. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=251.61999999999998s)]
*  Both cases stemmed from House referrals recommending that the Justice Department bring prosecutions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  Now someone might say who hasn't looked at these issues for very long, well, if Congress [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=259.82s)]
*  issues a subpoena, you're legally required to obey it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  And if you don't obey it, or you go there and you don't give the documents that they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=268.82s)]
*  asked for and the evidence and testimony that they demand truthfully, you will be held [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=272.54s)]
*  in contempt of Congress and that is a crime. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=276.54s)]
*  The problem is that there is a long history of the executive branch refusing to comply [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=279.66s)]
*  with congressional subpoenas on the grounds that they have the power as the executive [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=284.94s)]
*  branch that is supposed to be separate from the legislative power, that they have rights [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  as the executive branch not to turn over information or appear to testify when a co-equal branch, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  which is Congress, demands their appearance. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=300.5s)]
*  Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro are by far not the first people to give a middle finger [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=304.62s)]
*  to Congress when they've issued a subpoena, people who are in the executive branch or [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=310.18s)]
*  who were in the executive branch, and yet you'd be hard pressed to find another case [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=313.3s)]
*  where people explicitly were held in contempt of congressional subpoenas but who were referred [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=318.38s)]
*  to the Justice Department and or then prosecuted by the Justice Department for it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=322.9s)]
*  This is a case where the Biden Justice Department took a referral from a Democratic run committee, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=328.62s)]
*  the January 6 committee that was created under Nancy Pelosi's speakership, a committee where [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=334.1s)]
*  for the first time in the history of our country, the House Speaker rejected the members that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  the minority, the Republicans, wanted to put on that committee. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  She said no, those are not going on this committee. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=350.18s)]
*  The first time in history that a House Speaker refused to impanel the members of Congress [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=352.4s)]
*  indicated as members of that committee by the House minority leader. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  And instead, as a result, no Republicans agreed to serve on that committee in protest except [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  for two Republicans, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who obviously are far more aligned with the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=368.56s)]
*  Democratic Party when it comes to January 6, so in effect it was a fully partisan panel. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  And so the Democrats in Congress referred these contempt citations to the Biden Justice [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  Department which in turn decided to prosecute, something almost unprecedented in our history. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=385.64s)]
*  I just want to give you a few similar cases to understand what a complete deviation this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=390.56s)]
*  is from how things have typically been done in Washington. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=396.64s)]
*  Here from CNN in February of 2008 during the Bush administration, there you see the headline, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=400.0s)]
*  Attorney General declines to investigate Bush advisors. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=407.48s)]
*  U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Friday said he will not ask a federal grand jury [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  to investigate whether two top Bush administration officials should be prosecuted for contempt [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=416.0s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=421.0s)]
*  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Thursday asked Mukasey to look into whether White House Chief [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=422.6s)]
*  of Staff Josh Bolton and former White House counsel Harriet Myers committed contempt of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=426.88s)]
*  Congress in the investigation of the 2006 firing of several U.S. attorneys. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=431.6s)]
*  Earlier this month the House voted to fine Bolton and Myers in contempt of Congress and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=436.4s)]
*  pursue charges against them, but the White House argues that forcing the aides to testify [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=440.08s)]
*  would violate the Constitution's separation of powers. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=445.4s)]
*  And that has been the long-standing view in Washington, that if Congress orders a private [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  citizen to appear for a legitimate investigation, and there are all kinds of limits on what [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=455.64s)]
*  Congress is permitted to investigate, and I think it's extremely questionable whether [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=460.64s)]
*  or not they have the authority to investigate private citizens for January 6th because in [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  general the only two types of investigations that Congress has permitted to initiate are [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=471.24s)]
*  one to exercise oversight over the executive branch and number two to hold hearings for [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=477.28s)]
*  the purpose of deciding what legislation they want to pass. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  So if they're, for example, thinking about various legislation related to a certain industry, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=487.24s)]
*  you call the people in that industry, you call the activists against that industry, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=492.94s)]
*  and you hear from all the sides, and then you decide what kind of legislation is appropriate. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=496.24s)]
*  That's one example of when Congress can convene investigative hearings. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=500.66s)]
*  The other is solely to investigate executive branch officials. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=503.64s)]
*  It's never to investigate private citizens, and yet that's exactly what the January 6th [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=507.04s)]
*  committee here did. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=513.2s)]
*  This precedent saying that Congress can't investigate private citizens for their political [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=514.2s)]
*  views came out of the McCarthy hearings when the Supreme Court twice, the Supreme Court [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=518.0400000000001s)]
*  twice in the 1950s told Congress, you're vastly exceeding the scope of your investigative [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=523.1600000000001s)]
*  powers by trying to investigate and harass people for their political views, and that's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  exactly what the January 6th committee did. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=533.32s)]
*  But even leaving all that partisanship and all that precedent aside, there have been [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=536.12s)]
*  so many other cases where Congress declared a certain executive official to be in contempt [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=540.92s)]
*  of Congress, and it never went to the point where Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro's case [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  have gone. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=550.52s)]
*  Here from CBS News in June of 2012, another example, the White House says Eric Holder, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=551.52s)]
*  the Obama attorney general, won't be prosecuted for contempt. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=557.4s)]
*  One day after the House voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for failing, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  and contempt of Congress for failing to provide documents relating to the fast and furious [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=566.6s)]
*  gun walking program. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=570.64s)]
*  Many of you may not even remember what that was, but it was a scandal involving the Justice [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=573.0s)]
*  Department and whether they were committing all kinds of serious weapons to come in through [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  the border, the border with Mexico, through illegal integration, and Congress was investigating [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=580.24s)]
*  that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=587.28s)]
*  Eric Holder refused to turn over documents. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=588.28s)]
*  The House held him in contempt. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=589.32s)]
*  And yet the White House spokesperson for the Obama White House, Jay Carney, said the criminal [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=593.22s)]
*  prosecution of the contempt charges will not move forward. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=597.46s)]
*  He said the President's assertion of executive privilege over the related documents makes [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=601.5s)]
*  the matter moot. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=605.4200000000001s)]
*  In a letter sent to the House Speaker, John Boehner, Deputy Attorney General James Cole [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=607.74s)]
*  confirmed that justice would not move forward with contempt prosecutions. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=611.34s)]
*  I'll take you all the way back to 1983 during the first term of the Reagan administration, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=618.54s)]
*  where you can see just how longstanding this issue is that has not resulted in these kinds [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  of prosecutions. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=628.74s)]
*  From the New York Times March of 1983, there you see the headline, the Attorney General, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=629.74s)]
*  that was Ronald Reagan's Attorney General William French Smith, defends action by the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=634.74s)]
*  Justice Department in the contempt case. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=639.62s)]
*  Quote, under sharp questioning today by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=642.18s)]
*  General William French Smith repeatedly maintained that there was no way to prevent conflicts [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=648.14s)]
*  between the executive and legislative branches, like the battle over access to EPA documents. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=651.98s)]
*  So Congress was trying to get documents to investigate what the Reagan administration [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=658.9000000000001s)]
*  was doing with the Environmental Protection Agency, and EPA officials and others refused [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=662.2s)]
*  to hand them over, claiming that that was the executive prerogative to formulate policy, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=667.4200000000001s)]
*  and Congress had no right to intrude. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=672.1s)]
*  And so when William French Smith went before the Congress and they grilled him on why he [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=674.74s)]
*  wasn't prosecuting them and why the Justice Department was, he said, quote, there is a [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=677.9s)]
*  built-in conflict and tensions between the branches, Mr. Smith asserted, adding, quote, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=681.98s)]
*  as long as we have the system of government, I don't see how we can avoid the kind of problem [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=687.38s)]
*  we've had here. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=691.46s)]
*  Several committee members expressing dissatisfaction with Mr. Smith's responses demanded a guarantee [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=693.58s)]
*  that the House would not be ignored the next time it cited an official in the executive [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=698.78s)]
*  branch for contempt and sought to have the case prosecuted. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=702.4s)]
*  The dispute involves the DOJ's action in the contempt case against the head of the Environmental [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  Agency, Anne McGill Burford. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=710.04s)]
*  These are all causing very ancient memories to return from an old political scandal, but [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=713.9599999999999s)]
*  this really was the same conflict between the EPA and Congress. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=719.48s)]
*  And the EPA director, the one by the name of Anne Burford, who was highly controversial, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=722.48s)]
*  she was extremely conservative and put in charge of the EPA, was very pro-industry, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=728.24s)]
*  anti-environmentalist, and the Congress, run by Democrats for years, the House, wanted [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=732.28s)]
*  to investigate her and she refused to turn over documents and the Reagan Justice Department [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=737.16s)]
*  refused to prosecute her for it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=740.1999999999999s)]
*  Representative Peter W. Rodino, the New Jersey Democrat who was chairman of the committee, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=742.9599999999999s)]
*  told Mr. Smith that by law the United States attorney had a, quote, mandatory duty to present [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=746.36s)]
*  the contempt case to a grand jury, but he suggested that the department seemed to believe [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=751.68s)]
*  it was free to make its own decisions on whether to prosecute. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=756.68s)]
*  Just look at how many cases involving Republican administrations and Democratic administrations [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=762.24s)]
*  where members of the executive branch or people close to the president refused to turn over [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=769.4s)]
*  information demanded by subpoena by congressional committees who were trying to investigate [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=774.6s)]
*  the executive branch. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=778.52s)]
*  And typically because of this notion that the two branches are co-equal, one is not [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=780.88s)]
*  in charge of the other, one can't order the other one around. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=786.28s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi can't pick up the phone and order Donald Trump to appear before Congress or [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=790.72s)]
*  order his White House chief of staff to appear before Congress because that would make the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=795.24s)]
*  Congress supreme and not a co-equal branch. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=799.2s)]
*  And that's why the two parties, the two agencies, the two branches of government are constantly [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=802.76s)]
*  fighting with one another over when they have to turn over documents. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=806.48s)]
*  And it's an inherent and natural part of our system that has often been resolved politically [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=809.6s)]
*  but almost never with prosecutions, even when, as in the case of Eric Holder and other instances, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=814.88s)]
*  the Congress declared that official in contempt of Congress and referred the contempt charges [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=821.5600000000001s)]
*  to the Justice Department. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=828.32s)]
*  In all these cases, the Justice Department refused to prosecute until, as always, that [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=829.32s)]
*  consensus, that ethos, that rule in Washington for how Washington runs was completely abandoned [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=836.84s)]
*  solely for Donald Trump and his aides. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=843.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's just no denying that all of these longstanding precedents in Washington, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=846.32s)]
*  for better or for worse, and I'm against a lot of them, I'd be the first one applauding [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=849.84s)]
*  if they were really undone. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=854.1600000000001s)]
*  That's not what's happening here. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=856.5200000000001s)]
*  This is a one-time only suspension of these longstanding rules, not an abandonment of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=858.84s)]
*  them in the name of criminalizing the Trump movement and doing everything to sabotage [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=863.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's attempt to return to office. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=869.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, as I suggested at the start, this ethos in Washington was a major part of my journalism [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=871.64s)]
*  for the first 10 years. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=879.64s)]
*  It was a topic on which I focused incessantly, and that was because I had started writing [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=881.4s)]
*  about the war on terror and I began to see that a lot of what was being done by the Bush [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=886.5s)]
*  and Cheney administration and the neocons who ran the relevant agencies was not just [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=890.04s)]
*  misguided or dangerous or destructive, but was illegal, criminal. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=895.64s)]
*  That definitely included the way the Bush administration was spying on American citizens [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=902.0s)]
*  without the warrants required by law. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=907.1199999999999s)]
*  Something that Congress went and retroactively legalized in 2008 that became the FISA law [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  that now gets renewed all the time and that just got recently renewed to allow spying [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=914.16s)]
*  on American citizens with no warrants, but at the time it was plainly illegal and criminal. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  The same is true for torturing detainees, which had always been a crime in the United [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=922.8s)]
*  States, kidnapping with no due process, and other similar ones as well. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=925.5999999999999s)]
*  And so every time I was arguing that these were crimes and that they should be prosecuted, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=932.76s)]
*  what I always heard from long-time journalists in the media and from the consensus of Washington [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=937.4799999999999s)]
*  was that, well, it doesn't really matter if those acts are illegal or not because here [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=943.4s)]
*  in Washington we don't prosecute top-level political officials for the acts they've undertaken [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=947.76s)]
*  as part of their executive branch duties. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=953.08s)]
*  That only happens in banana republics. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=955.26s)]
*  That's called criminalizing policy differences or criminalizing legal disputes between the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=956.86s)]
*  two branches. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=961.78s)]
*  And you just don't do that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=962.78s)]
*  Otherwise you're going to have a never-ending cycle of retribution where one party is putting [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=963.78s)]
*  the other in prison the minute it gets hold of the levers of the Justice Department. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=967.26s)]
*  One of the first debates I ever had with a classic member of the corporate media was [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=975.34s)]
*  when NBC News' Chuck Todd went on the air and basically scoffed at the idea, and this [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=983.26s)]
*  is in 2009, the first year of the Obama administration, that there should be any investigations, at [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=990.78s)]
*  all criminal investigations of Bush officials or what Bush officials did in the past or [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=995.82s)]
*  CIA officials did or the NSA did, because this is a distraction, he said. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1000.26s)]
*  It doesn't really matter. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1004.78s)]
*  It's not the stuff that Obama should be doing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1006.18s)]
*  He should be caring about appearing as a centrist, those sorts of things. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1007.8199999999999s)]
*  And that in Washington we just simply don't prosecute prior administrations or our political [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1011.9s)]
*  enemies. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1019.26s)]
*  And I can't tell you how many columns like that were written, how many TV pundits went [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1020.5s)]
*  on cable news and said that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1024.82s)]
*  It was the overwhelming consensus. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1026.32s)]
*  I can't think of anyone in corporate media who believed that President Obama should investigate, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1028.8200000000002s)]
*  criminally investigate or prosecute prior acts of the Bush administration. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1035.14s)]
*  And in fact, so intense was the media pressure on Obama that despite promising repeatedly [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1038.26s)]
*  in the 2008 campaign that he would give it to his attorney general with the instructions [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1045.16s)]
*  to look into it, to investigate it, and to prosecute if there was reasonable grounds [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1049.8s)]
*  for believing crimes were committed, saying, I'm not going to be involved. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1053.8600000000001s)]
*  This is a legal question. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1056.68s)]
*  Nobody's above the law. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1058.54s)]
*  I'll ask my attorney general to look at it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1059.54s)]
*  Two months into office, Obama announced that he was not going to allow any prosecutions [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1061.1s)]
*  of anyone in the prior administration, including in the CIA, for any of these crimes, pronouncing [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1068.18s)]
*  it's more important that we look forward than backward, which never made any sense on its [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1073.42s)]
*  own terms because all criminal prosecutions, by definition, require looking backward. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1080.14s)]
*  By definition, they're acts that were undertaken in the past. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1086.6s)]
*  And so if when it comes to the prior administration, we're going to adopt the view that we don't [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1090.56s)]
*  look backward, we only look forward for the good of the country or whatever, then it is [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1093.76s)]
*  a complete immunity or exemption for politicians from being prosecuted by the law in the same [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1097.76s)]
*  way that ordinary American citizens are prosecuted. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1103.76s)]
*  And I was indignant about this. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1106.56s)]
*  I wrote article after article. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1108.52s)]
*  I wrote, as I said, a 2011 book arguing against this mindset. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1109.9199999999998s)]
*  And in 2009, I had a big enough platform that I really couldn't be ignored any longer [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1114.28s)]
*  by people in the corporate media. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1119.0s)]
*  And so I wrote an article about Chuck Todd's comments and heavily criticized them. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1120.44s)]
*  And he said, hey, I wish you had talked to me before. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1124.28s)]
*  And I said, well, I don't think I have the obligation. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1127.12s)]
*  I'm just criticizing your public remarks. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1128.68s)]
*  But I'd love to engage you on this. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1130.28s)]
*  And why don't you come on and we'll do a podcast and I can ask you questions and you can ask [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1132.0s)]
*  me and we'll debate this issue. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1135.8s)]
*  And here you see Huffington Post in August of 2009 reporting on that debate. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1138.72s)]
*  Chuck Todd and Glenn Rewall debate torture and the media. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1143.36s)]
*  So I'm just going to give you one passage from this discussion that I had with him to [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1145.9199999999998s)]
*  illustrate to you how adamant these people were that we cannot have prosecutions of our [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1150.9199999999998s)]
*  political adversaries or our past administrations. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1158.08s)]
*  So I said to him, quote, let me ask you about that then. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1161.4199999999998s)]
*  If a president can find, as a president always will be able to find, some low level functionary [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1165.9199999999998s)]
*  in the Justice Department, a John Yoo, to write a memo authorizing whatever it is the president [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1170.68s)]
*  wants to do and to use and to say that it's legal, then you think the president ought [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1175.1200000000001s)]
*  to be immune from prosecution whenever he breaks the law. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1180.6000000000001s)]
*  As long as he has a permission slip from the Justice Department. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1182.76s)]
*  I mean, that's the argument that's being made. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  Don't you think that's extremely dangerous? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1187.0s)]
*  He then replied, that could be dangerous. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1190.16s)]
*  But let me tell you this. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1192.5800000000002s)]
*  Is it healthy for our reputation around the world? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1193.64s)]
*  And this, I think, is that we have to do what other countries do more often than not, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1197.04s)]
*  so-called democracies that struggle with their democracy and sit there and always put the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1201.92s)]
*  previous administration on trial. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1206.3999999999999s)]
*  You don't think that we will start having retributions on that going forward? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1207.8s)]
*  Look, I am in no way excusing torture. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1212.48s)]
*  I'm not excusing torture and I bristle at the attack when it comes on this specific [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1215.1599999999999s)]
*  issue. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1218.84s)]
*  But I think the political reality in this, and I understand where you're coming from, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1219.84s)]
*  you're just saying just because something's politically tough doesn't mean we shouldn't [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1222.84s)]
*  do it. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1225.92s)]
*  I don't disagree with you from 30,000 feet. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1226.92s)]
*  That is an idealistic view of this thing. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1229.28s)]
*  Then you have the realistic view of how this town works. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1231.92s)]
*  That is what he was saying. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1236.52s)]
*  He said, oh, it's very idealistic to think that prior administrations or political officials [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1237.8000000000002s)]
*  in Washington are going to be held accountable under the criminal law the same way ordinary [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1242.44s)]
*  citizens are. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1245.8400000000001s)]
*  He said, I don't disagree with you looking at things from 30,000 feet, this very kind [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1247.5800000000002s)]
*  of idealistic academic view that you have, this idealistic view that you have that people [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1255.1599999999999s)]
*  in Washington should be held accountable when they violate the criminal law like everyone [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1260.9599999999998s)]
*  else does. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1264.32s)]
*  Then he went on to say, then you have the realistic view of how this town works. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1265.32s)]
*  Lecturing me, you're not a lead in Washington. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1268.9599999999998s)]
*  You don't understand Washington. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1272.1399999999999s)]
*  You don't live here. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1273.32s)]
*  You don't work here. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1275.0s)]
*  You don't know these government officials. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1276.0s)]
*  I'm going to tell you what the realistic view of how this town really works, not the idealistic [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1277.0s)]
*  view that you think that people can be prosecuted from the prior administration if they break [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1282.04s)]
*  the law. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1285.8s)]
*  This is really how the town works. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1286.8s)]
*  And he said, quote, and what would happen, and is it good for our reputation around the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1287.8s)]
*  world if we're essentially putting on trial, is it good for our reputation around the world [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1292.52s)]
*  if we're essentially putting on trial the previous administration? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1299.52s)]
*  We would look at another country doing that and say, geez, boy, this is essentially like [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1304.44s)]
*  what tyrannies do or what banana republics do. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1311.36s)]
*  And the reason I was so interested in having this conversation with Chuck Todd is not because [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1316.36s)]
*  he was some aberrational voice in the US media. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1323.36s)]
*  Just look at this, this ethos here that you just, in Washington, the hardcore reality, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1327.8s)]
*  if you know how Washington works is you do not go around prosecuting your political opponents, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1333.04s)]
*  people in the other party, people from the prior administration. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1337.3999999999999s)]
*  This is what they had been saying for decades, for decades. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1339.96s)]
*  It's how they excused the pardon of Richard Nixon by Gerald Ford, even though the evidence [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1345.0s)]
*  was overwhelming that you could have convicted Richard Nixon of crimes the way you did with [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1349.64s)]
*  many of his top aides, all of whom got pardoned. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1352.88s)]
*  During the Reagan administration, there was an Iran Contra scandal that involved highly [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1357.28s)]
*  likely criminality on the part of Reagan officials who wanted to fund the war in Nicaragua, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1363.2s)]
*  fund the Contras in a civil war, even though Congress had passed a law saying any funding [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1370.8400000000001s)]
*  of the Contras in Nicaragua is illegal and hereby banned. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1376.56s)]
*  The executive branch went and ignored that law, but they couldn't get funds from Congress, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1381.88s)]
*  so what they did was they sold highly sophisticated missiles and other weapons to Iran, got the [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1385.8400000000001s)]
*  cash at the White House in secret accounts, and then sent that money secretly to fund [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1391.72s)]
*  the Contras even though Congress had said you can't. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1398.04s)]
*  A lot of the top officials in the Reagan administration were at risk of being prosecuted, including [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1401.68s)]
*  George Bush, the then vice president. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1406.76s)]
*  The minute George Bush got elected, the first thing he did was issue a pardon of Caspar [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1409.72s)]
*  Weinberger and of every other Reagan administration official, and most people in the media applauded [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1416.16s)]
*  that and said, yeah, we can't be distracted by these kinds of prosecutions. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1421.28s)]
*  We can't be prosecuting people in Washington. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1424.12s)]
*  It's too much of a distraction. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1427.04s)]
*  It makes us seem like a banana republic. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1428.04s)]
*  This has been the argument for so long. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1429.4399999999998s)]
*  And if I really believe that this was finally being lifted and the idea was, look, we're [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1432.7199999999998s)]
*  going to prosecute people no matter how powerful they are in Washington. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1439.7199999999998s)]
*  Anytime they actually break the law, I would be the happiest person. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1442.36s)]
*  I'd be the first one to stand up and cheer. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1445.7199999999998s)]
*  But it's so obvious that's not what's happening. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1448.52s)]
*  There's no remorse or regret about how this was done previously. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1450.6s)]
*  The minute Trump is out of the scene, they're going to return right again to this rule, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1454.24s)]
*  this ethos, this hardcore reality, independent of the idealistic view that in this town, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1459.56s)]
*  you can't really go around prosecuting political adversaries and prior administrations because [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1464.48s)]
*  it's going to make us look like a banana republic. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1468.48s)]
*  It's a one time exception only as so many things are for abusing and weaponizing the [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1470.32s)]
*  justice system against one person and one person only, and that is Donald Trump. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I265Fcodk&t=1475.48s)]
