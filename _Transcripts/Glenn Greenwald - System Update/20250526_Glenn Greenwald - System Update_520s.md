# Major Influencer Under Fire for Online Gambling Promo
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI)
*  Now I just want to show you something else that happened in Brazil because it's both [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=0.0s)]
*  interesting and important but also incredibly pathetic but also darkly hilarious. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=10.16s)]
*  Brazil has a major problem with gambling. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=18.2s)]
*  Legalized gambling in 2017, there was this interim president who took over when they [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=23.28s)]
*  impeached the elected president. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=27.74s)]
*  He was incredibly unpopular. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=30.5s)]
*  He left office with 4% approval rating. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  He was basically there to carry out an agenda of serving banks, of austerity that nobody [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=34.739999999999995s)]
*  elected but he ascended to the presidency. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=39.739999999999995s)]
*  In his lame duck period when he was already on his way out when the election had happened [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=43.86s)]
*  and the elected Bolsonaro, he was on his way out. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  He issued an order legalizing sports betting in Brazil. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=51.82s)]
*  And almost overnight there were dozens of companies with apps allowing anyone to bet. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=55.62s)]
*  You transfer your money into the betting account and then you start betting. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=65.66s)]
*  And it grew very quickly including slot machines and other computer gambling and what has happened [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=69.9s)]
*  is it was done basically without any regulations and huge numbers of poor people, Brazil is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=77.34s)]
*  a country with massive income inequality. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=82.5s)]
*  A lot of poor people survive on a pretty innovative welfare program where they give monthly payments [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=85.3s)]
*  to mothers as long as they keep their kids' health certificate updated, take them to the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=92.1s)]
*  doctor and ensure they're going to school so they demand things of the family to get [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  this payment and other people just have very small amounts of resources. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=101.62s)]
*  They get the paycheck once a month that barely pays their expenses and so many of these people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=105.5s)]
*  now are addicted to gambling. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=109.48s)]
*  They just have the apps right in front of them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=110.82s)]
*  They immediately get this money. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=112.86s)]
*  They transfer it to the gambling apps. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  Obviously they're doing it because they're told that they have a chance to get out of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=116.14s)]
*  poverty and become wealthy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=119.14s)]
*  And instead, as you can imagine, huge numbers are going massively into debt and some people [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  have committed suicide over it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=127.14s)]
*  It's a horrific problem that has really exacerbated the problem of poverty and income inequality [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=129.14s)]
*  in Brazil. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=136.6s)]
*  One of the most significant drivers of this, of poor people downloading these apps and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=138.72s)]
*  betting all their money to feed their family, to pay their rent, is that you have these [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=145.68s)]
*  gigantic influencers, like Instagram influencers, kind of like Kim Kardashian types who are [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=150.98s)]
*  just mega famous for being Instagram influencers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=157.24s)]
*  They're beloved primarily by younger people, by poor people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=160.56s)]
*  These gambling companies are paying these influencers millions and millions of dollars [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=167.0s)]
*  to constantly promote gambling to their fans, their poor fans, their young fans. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=171.76s)]
*  They're like, oh, this is the way you can get rich. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=178.48s)]
*  They fabricate videos showing the influencer betting and winning all this money. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=181.02s)]
*  You can win tons of money. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=186.0s)]
*  Obviously people look up to these people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=187.0s)]
*  They have very wealthy lifestyles. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=188.4s)]
*  They want to be like them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=189.4s)]
*  They're getting very rich, these influencers, on encouraging people to gamble, even knowing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  they have a very young audience, huge numbers of poor people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=198.44s)]
*  Oftentimes these multimillion dollar contracts that these influencers include a provision [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=201.64s)]
*  that says if you increase our profits by a certain percent, you then get, in addition [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=206.48s)]
*  to the million dollars, you get a cut of that increase in profit, meaning these influencers [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=213.28s)]
*  have an incentive to create as much loss for their following, for their audience, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=217.6s)]
*  their fans as they can. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=225.64s)]
*  The more money their fans lose by betting on their links or part of their app, the more [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=229.88s)]
*  money they make. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=235.2s)]
*  It's such a dystopian thing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=237.24s)]
*  These people are so rich, these people with like tens of millions of followers on Instagram [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=239.28s)]
*  for doing nothing but being influencers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=243.64s)]
*  On top of that, you need so much money more to encourage people you know can't afford [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=245.88s)]
*  it whose lives are going to be ruined. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=250.96s)]
*  Just constantly bet by encouraging them by using your influence and the credibility that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  you have over them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=256.8s)]
*  The Brazilian Senate decided it was going to create a formal committee like the US Congress [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=257.8s)]
*  does that gives them the power to subpoena people to conduct an investigation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=264.24s)]
*  They decided they were going to subpoena these influencers, these mega famous influencers, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  mega rich, mega famous influencers to go and testify for the Senate about this very [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  serious matter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=281.76s)]
*  Last week they began with, or maybe she was second, this woman named Vanessa Fonseca, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=284.88s)]
*  Virginia Fonseca who is basically the most famous and beloved Instagram influencer in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=294.24s)]
*  Brazil. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=300.76s)]
*  I guess you could call her Kim Kardashian of Brazil, not quite as globally known obviously, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=301.76s)]
*  but she has like 55 million Instagram followers, hundreds of millions of followers across platforms. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=305.88s)]
*  She goes anywhere, there's a huge uproar. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=311.92s)]
*  They decided they were going to call her and interrogate her like you would an investigative [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=315.0s)]
*  committee about her contract with them, about what she's doing, about whether she even thinks [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  about the harm she's causing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=324.48s)]
*  Instead, these senators were so giddy and enamored that they were in the presence of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  this 26 year old Instagram influencer, all their wives and daughters love her, that instead [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=335.0s)]
*  of questioning her they were like throwing compliments at her. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=343.48s)]
*  And then in the middle of this session one senator, this is a federally elected senator, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=348.76s)]
*  after praising her and defending her, he stood up and asked her whether he could bring his [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=353.67999999999995s)]
*  phone up so that she would make a selfie and a video saying a little message to his wife [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  and daughter who are huge fans. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  Here's, let me just show you this, here's what happened, his name is Senator Clay Chino [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=367.84s)]
*  and you just have to see this to believe it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=372.26s)]
*  He says, you are a generator of wealth, you create wealth for the society, you create [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=374.32s)]
*  jobs so keep bringing this to society. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=380.32s)]
*  What we need is for us politicians here with all due respect to the excellent present here, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=383.52s)]
*  but the real excellence is her who pays our salaries, our taxes are rigorously paid while [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=388.88s)]
*  we are a source of expenditures. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=393.76s)]
*  I'm not here today to point my finger at you but to persuade you to try and touch your [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=395.84s)]
*  heart so that you may now start doing advertisements against this kind of gambling. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=400.4s)]
*  In fact, I'm finishing up here, can I quickly ask you to send a greeting to my wife and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=404.88s)]
*  my daughter? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=409.12s)]
*  And they all laugh and she's like, for sure! [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=410.12s)]
*  And she has a little pink cup there and her sweatshirt and he comes up and she asks what [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=412.32s)]
*  the names are of the wife and the daughter and she does a little selfie video for them, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=418.32s)]
*  pass them on the back. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=423.12s)]
*  He seems not at all embarrassed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=425.88s)]
*  And can you imagine being a senator and then calling this 26 year old influencer who's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  doing immense harm? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=433.88s)]
*  You have created a committee to investigate it instead of you're like, thank you so much, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  your wealth is so important to us, you pay our salaries, you're doing great things, do [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  you mind if I come up? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=443.47999999999996s)]
*  And then after, the leaders of the committee and all the other senators lined up to take [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  selfies with her. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=450.96s)]
*  To several of the senators, there she is in her sweatshirt that she decided to wear with [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=453.16s)]
*  her jeans to the Senate, to testify in the Senate. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=458.48s)]
*  There's actually a rule by the way that if you testify in the Senate, you're supposed [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=461.44s)]
*  to wear a suit, but it didn't apply to her. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=464.64s)]
*  And there these senators are posing, smiling when the whole point is supposed to be that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=468.68s)]
*  she's this evil person who's getting richer and richer by destroying the lives of her [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=473.3s)]
*  young and poor fans by encouraging them to engage in an addictive behavior that destroys [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=479.84s)]
*  their lives and their families' lives. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=484.44s)]
*  It's, I don't know, it's just one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=486.44s)]
*  One of the most pathetic. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvWCK28hdI&t=491.03999999999996s)]
