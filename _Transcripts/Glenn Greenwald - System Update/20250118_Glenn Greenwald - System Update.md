# What Would A Free Palestine Look Like?: With Journalist Abubaker Abed
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI)
*  You've spoken a few times about this desire for peace, the fact that it's the Israelis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=0.0s)]
*  who sabotage that possibility. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  You've said a few times in several answers, including this last one, this idea of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  liberation of Palestine and a free Palestine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  What does that mean to you? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=23.12s)]
*  What does that future realistically look like in a world where Palestinian liberation is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=24.36s)]
*  achieved, where Palestine is free, and where peace prevails in the region in which you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  live? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=37.04s)]
*  Again, peace cannot be achieved without every European dismantled, I believe so. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=38.04s)]
*  We have to make sure that this point is very crystal clear, that we don't have any problems [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=48.56s)]
*  with the Jews themselves. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=53.68s)]
*  Israel does not represent the Jews. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=55.64s)]
*  We've seen many Jews speaking out against Israel, and we've seen many of those Jews [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=57.36s)]
*  opposing the genocide in Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=62.36s)]
*  So it's a definite matter here, when we talk about the Jews and we talk about Zionism. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=65.16s)]
*  Zionism, which is Israeli right now because it's their government, it's their entity, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=69.84s)]
*  is causing and wreaking havoc in the region. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=75.32s)]
*  The first step to do is to dismantle it, and if we dismantle it, we have long-term [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=79.88s)]
*  peace. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=86.28s)]
*  This can be very feasible. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=87.28s)]
*  Now to a different time, to a different matter, which is or issue, that if Palestine is free, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  what does that mean? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  It's been 22 years, five wars, including the Holocaust, and you never felt that I was [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  free. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=105.24s)]
*  I remember Glenn very, very well when my friend who was killed last December, December 2023, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=106.24s)]
*  and I were watching videos on YouTube of people living outside the world, and we were wishing, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=113.0s)]
*  like, we needed to go outside Gaza. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=120.6s)]
*  We needed to live this life. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Like, when are we going to live that type of life and have all these lifestyles and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=125.28s)]
*  all this happiness and that we have freedom to go anywhere around the world? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=135.32s)]
*  But before October the 7th even, because we are now getting back to just what Gaza was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  before October the 7th, this is what the ceasefire is going to secure for Palestinians. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=146.04s)]
*  But you know, because I said to you, this is just a tiny reprieve from the horrors from [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=151.4s)]
*  what we've been going through. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=157.72s)]
*  But Palestine is free simply means that every Palestinian has the right and has the, has [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=159.4s)]
*  the insoles to determine what they want to be in the future. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  They have the right to go back, to go around the world, to travel around the world, to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=170.76s)]
*  do research, and meet people, socialize with different people, have their time. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=174.68s)]
*  I don't remember, like, even the outlets we had before this genocide or assault on the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=179.8s)]
*  Gaza Strip, the outlets were very limited. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=185.56s)]
*  We had only a few stadiums, the sea, and a few restaurants. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=188.4s)]
*  What is, what does life mean? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=193.08s)]
*  What did life really mean when most of the people, most of the people in Gaza were not [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=196.32s)]
*  working, they were unemployed, and most of the people didn't have even a source of living [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=201.28s)]
*  to provide the families with everyday lunch? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=208.84s)]
*  What life meant when the vast majority of university students didn't have the ability [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=212.96s)]
*  to afford the tuition fees? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=219.0s)]
*  People are not aware of that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=221.72s)]
*  They think that Gaza was just the nicest and was full of luxury before this war. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=222.72s)]
*  But this is not simply not true. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  But if Palestine is free, I haven't seen my homeland, I'm still a refugee inside Dar al-Bala. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=232.0s)]
*  People know that I'm a refugee inside Dar al-Bala. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=239.56s)]
*  That's what I'm named by the United Nations itself, which is that I'm a refugee in Dar [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=243.12s)]
*  al-Bala. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=249.44s)]
*  My hometown is Beitaraz. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=250.44s)]
*  I haven't seen it at all. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=252.36s)]
*  My parents haven't seen it at all. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=254.56s)]
*  This, if we see it, even Jerusalem itself, and the Al-Aqsa Moors, we haven't seen those [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=257.24s)]
*  agricultural lands and ecological sites and those beautiful places, markets and houses [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=264.4s)]
*  and buildings. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=272.4s)]
*  We haven't seen them at all. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=273.4s)]
*  So what is the meaning of freedom? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=275.52s)]
*  What is the meaning of self-determination when you don't have the ability to go around [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=278.88s)]
*  or to go outside Gaza to another town in Palestine? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=286.52s)]
*  So this is the meaning of liberation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=291.8s)]
*  This is why Palestine must be free, because as a young man, it's been 22 years of extreme [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=295.56s)]
*  horror, of extreme suffering, of nonstop pain, nonstop anguish. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=301.92s)]
*  Our agony is literally indescribable. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=308.56s)]
*  The pain is simply unfathomable, has always been unfathomable. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=311.68s)]
*  To be, it's just a very, very unbelievable thing that we are surviving this genocide, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  that I have survived, that the little people here in Gaza have survived the 5th war in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=322.84s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=329.24s)]
*  A lot of newborn babies who were born during this war or this genocidal war on the illegal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=330.24s)]
*  territory haven't made it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=337.52s)]
*  They were born into it, they were born during it, and they were killed in it as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=339.68s)]
*  This is just indicative of what it means that Palestinians can be free, what it means to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  sacrifice until the last breath for making it possible and real, for making our dreams [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=356.88s)]
*  come true that Palestine is going to be free. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=363.88s)]
*  It's going to be securing every right for us. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=366.56s)]
*  It's going to be securing the hope of Palestinians and the liberation they have been always waiting [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=369.48s)]
*  for and craving, and we are going to see our loved ones, our members and family members. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  I know a lot of families who are separated, like a family, some of them are living inside [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=382.04s)]
*  Gaza, the others are living in the West Bank. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=387.6s)]
*  This is caused by Israel. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  I know many of those Nakba survivors who went through Nakba, went through Naksa, and different [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=393.12s)]
*  escalations, numerous escalations, and now they have gone through four wars and now they're [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=399.56s)]
*  genocide and they're still making it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=404.32s)]
*  This is our heritage. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=406.88s)]
*  This is our legacy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  This is our history that we are going to take all the time with us when we grow, when we [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=409.76s)]
*  build the next generations, when we bloom like flowers and like yellow roses in the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=415.24s)]
*  most beautiful garden, which is for us, Palestine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=420.96s)]
*  Well, I've expressed this before. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=424.6s)]
*  A lot of Western journalists like to herald themselves for confronting risks and being [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=426.96s)]
*  courageous. What you're doing and have been doing over the last 15 months is the real [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=432.6s)]
*  example of that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=437.16s)]
*  I really hope, first of all, that you stay safe. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=439.04s)]
*  I want to thank you for all the great work that you've been doing and I'm sure we'll [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=441.12s)]
*  continue to do. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=444.36s)]
*  We really appreciate your taking the time to talk to us and we would love to have you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=445.36s)]
*  back on again and continue to give you a platform and have your important words be heard as [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=449.12s)]
*  much as we can. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=454.72s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=455.72s)]
*  You're so welcome. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=456.72s)]
*  It's been my pleasure for sure. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=457.72s)]
*  Thank you for standing with us. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=459.72s)]
*  Thank you for standing with Palestinian journalists because most of the people there, where you [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  are at the moment, have let us down and simply have shown their humanity just for some money [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=469.48s)]
*  and just for absolutely nothing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=476.0s)]
*  So thank you so much and it was really lovely to talk to you. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=478.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you too. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=481.08000000000004s)]
*  Hope we do it again soon. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  Bye bye. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=483.08000000000004s)]
*  In times like these, uncertainty is the only certainty from geopolitical risks like the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=485.08s)]
*  one we've seen in Israel and Gaza and Ukraine, both of which risk destabilizing global markets [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=491.0s)]
*  to the Fed's nonstop money printing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  It's hard to feel secure about your financial future. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  Since 2020, the US dollar has lost 24% of its buying power and with inflation rising [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=501.2s)]
*  and government debt ballooning, your hard-earned savings are at risk. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=506.88s)]
*  That's why I trust Lear Capital to help me understand the market of gold and silver and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=510.12s)]
*  the benefits of it, physical assets that hold their value in turbulent times. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=515.2s)]
*  Lear has educated me and a lot of other people on how to diversify into gold, which gives [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw1k35P7OKI&t=520.28s)]
