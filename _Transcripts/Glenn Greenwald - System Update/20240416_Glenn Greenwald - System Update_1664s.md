# What Role is the US Playing in the Escalating Mid-East War between Iran and Israel?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg)
*  Israel has long considered Iran to be its arch nemesis in the region. For almost two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=0.0s)]
*  decades now, Israel has been repeatedly warning that Iran is just a few months [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  away or even a few weeks away from obtaining a nuclear weapon capability, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=18.48s)]
*  warnings that have never yet come to fruition. Iran has always been the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=24.36s)]
*  country that Israel claims is the greatest threat to peace in the region. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=29.8s)]
*  It is the country that Israel claims is a terrorist regime that wants to wipe [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=33.96s)]
*  Israel off of the face of the map. Now the reality is that while Iran does [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=38.68s)]
*  actually employ proxy agents throughout the region, they for example, just like [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=44.6s)]
*  the United States does, the Iranians for example do support and fund and finance [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=49.84s)]
*  the group Hezbollah, which people in that region regard as a defensive force [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=56.64s)]
*  against Israeli incursions into Lebanon, which happens very frequently, but of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=62.28s)]
*  course Israel in the West consider Hezbollah to be a terrorist organization. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=67.08000000000001s)]
*  There are other proxies that the Iranians use including in Yemen and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  throughout Syria and Iraq. Nothing strengthened Iran more than the US [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=76.48s)]
*  invasion of Iraq and occupation of that country. So it is true that Iran has [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=80.92s)]
*  tentacles in various aspects of that region, just like most countries who are [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=85.64s)]
*  powerful and large have influence in their own region, but the reality is Iran [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=90.68s)]
*  has not fought a war since the 1980s, which is when they had a protracted and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=96.4s)]
*  quite vicious war with Saddam Hussein in Iraq, a war that the United States [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=101.76s)]
*  supported Iraq and Saddam Hussein in. It's hard to make the case that Iran is some [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=106.92s)]
*  kind of unique warmongering country given that in those decades since Iran [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  has had their last war, the United States and Israel have both been involved in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  various ways in numerous wars, countless wars in fact. It's a very similar [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=124.0s)]
*  dynamic to the narrative about China. We're constantly being told that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=130.2s)]
*  China is this grave menace to world peace, that they are bent upon military [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  domination, and yet China has not fought a war since 1979. That is a fact. Again, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=139.76s)]
*  China has influence in its region, it suppresses the people of Hong Kong and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=148.56s)]
*  Tibet, but China has not fought an actual war with any other country since [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  1979. Again, think how many wars the United States has fought from Panama and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=160.0s)]
*  Yugoslavia and Central America and Grenada and Iraq and Afghanistan and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=167.44s)]
*  Syria and Libya. Now the war in Ukraine bombing Yemen, etc. helping the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=176.52s)]
*  Israelis bomb and destroy Gaza. The list is endless and in fact when the United [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=182.96s)]
*  States pulled out of Afghanistan after 20 years spending trillions of dollars [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=189.16s)]
*  losing the lives of many American soldiers, China released a video [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=194.2s)]
*  mocking the United States for the trillions of dollars it spent on these [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  pointless wars. The war in Afghanistan did nothing, Taliban marched right back [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=205.18s)]
*  into power as if nothing happened. The only two impacts of the invasion of Iraq [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  was that Iran was strengthened by eliminating Saddam Hussein, a dedicated [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=215.08s)]
*  enemy of Iran, and strengthening the Shia militias with which Iran uses to exert [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  its influence in Iraq. And then the other effect of the invasion of Iraq was to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=227.9s)]
*  create a vacuum out of which ISIS emerged and the Chinese mocked the United [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  States for spending all of their resources on these endless wars that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=237.72000000000003s)]
*  achieved nothing and pointed out that while the United States was doing that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=241.68s)]
*  China used its resources to build high-speed rail that connected its entire [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=245.28s)]
*  country. So when we hear these narratives all the time about how China is the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=252.08s)]
*  aggressor and the United States which has military bases encircling China is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=257.12s)]
*  the innocent victim, the innocent peace-loving victim, or how Iran is the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=262.44s)]
*  terrorist state and the United States and Israel are just the peace-loving [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=268.52s)]
*  nations that just want the application of world legal systems and peace. I think [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=274.35999999999996s)]
*  it's very important to keep in mind how propagandized we are when it comes to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=282.2s)]
*  that. Now there were all kinds of reactions in the United States to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  watching Iran launch a variety of missiles and drones at Israel. Obviously [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=290.56s)]
*  it was a new event to watch Iran not use proxies to attack Israel but to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=297.2s)]
*  actually attack Israel directly and there were immediate calls from [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=303.4s)]
*  Republicans and others that the United States, not Israel, but the United States [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=308.96s)]
*  should now go to war with Iran, should bomb Iran. The reality however was that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=313.12s)]
*  the reason Iran launched those missiles and drones against Israel, missiles and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=319.28s)]
*  drones that caused no damage, let alone any death inside Israel, was because they [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=325.8s)]
*  were essentially forced into that retaliation on April 1st which is when [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  the Israelis bombed the Iranian consulate in Syria and killed several [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=336.56s)]
*  officials. Remember here from AP, Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Syria, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=342.36s)]
*  killed two generals and five other officers. Iran says, quote, an Israeli [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=348.44s)]
*  attack that demolished Iran's consulate in Syria on Monday killed two Iranian [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=354.6s)]
*  generals and five officers. According to Iranian officials the strike appeared to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=359.04s)]
*  signify an escalation of Israel's targeting of military officials from Iran [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  which support militant groups fighting Israel and Gaza in a long its border [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  with Lebanon. Now Israel has done its own damage over many years to Iran. They've [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  launched all kinds of cyber attacks that have been very dangerous. Israel has [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=380.8s)]
*  assassinated scientists, nuclear scientists in Iran by claiming that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=386.68s)]
*  they're working on Iran's nuclear program and so it isn't as though these [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  two countries haven't done anything to one another. They have but bombing an [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=398.88s)]
*  embassy, something that is considered inviolable in diplomatic relations and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  that by treaty and convention is sacrosanct in international law. Something [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=407.56s)]
*  it's almost impossible to remember a country doing. I think the last time was [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=414.6s)]
*  when the United States by accident bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=417.92s)]
*  when they were fighting Serbia and they profusely apologized insisting it was an [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=425.68s)]
*  accident but I can't remember the last time that a country deliberately bombed [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=430.88s)]
*  another country's embassy that is a massive escalation almost guaranteed to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  provoke a retaliation and a response from Iran as it did. Now as I said Iran [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=442.2s)]
*  wanted to show that it would not sit by passively no country could but the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  actual reality of what Iran did in responding to Israel was far more [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  restrained and moderate than almost any other country's reaction would have been [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=460.84s)]
*  imagine what Israel and the United States would do if a foreign air force [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=465.32s)]
*  deliberately flew a fighter jet over an American embassy or Israeli embassy in [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=469.84s)]
*  the world and shot missiles at it and destroyed it and killed top American or [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=474.2s)]
*  Israeli officials I guarantee you they would do a lot more than what Iran's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=478.8s)]
*  just what Iran just did by all accounts Iran's response while intended to be [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=482.64s)]
*  dramatic and to look like it was a show of real force was in fact engineered and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=488.2s)]
*  calculated by Iran to cause as little damage as possible inside Israel in the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=494.08s)]
*  hope of avoiding rather than provoking further escalation here's the New York [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=499.2s)]
*  Times from earlier today a show of night in the skies over Israel quote Iran's [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=503.8s)]
*  retaliation for Israel's killing of senior military leaders was a highly [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  choreographed spectacle but fears of wider war still loomed the more than [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=514.72s)]
*  300 drones and missiles that hurled through Iraqi and Jordanian the airspace [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=519.68s)]
*  Saturday night before they were brought down seemed designed to cause maximum [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=524.28s)]
*  drama while inflicting minimal damage defense officials and military experts [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=528.68s)]
*  say so let's just highlight there the point of the Iranian response was [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  designed to create maximum drama while inflicting minimal damage which party [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=543.48s)]
*  seems to be the more restrained the more rational the more moderate the more [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=553.6s)]
*  eager to avoid regional escalation the Israelis that bombed the Iranian consulate [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=557.0s)]
*  in Damascus and killed senior leaders or Iran which deliberately responded in a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=564.24s)]
*  way that seemed erratic seemed to be a resolute show of force but was one which [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=571.08s)]
*  in fact was guaranteed as the Iranians both knew and intended to cause almost [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=577.08s)]
*  no damage inside of Israel quote just as they did back in 2020 when retaliating [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  for the US killing of General Soleimani is really in leaders this week gave [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=588.12s)]
*  plenty of warning that they were launching strikes Iran also sequenced [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  a retaliation for airstrikes on Iranian Embassy building in Syria on April 1st [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=599.44s)]
*  in such a way that both Israelis and Americans were able to adjust their [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=603.8800000000001s)]
*  arsenal aerial defenses once the Iranian missiles and drones were in the air the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=608.12s)]
*  result a lot of bang but relatively little destruction on the ground few of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=612.8800000000001s)]
*  Iran's drones and missiles found their intended targets an inaccuracy level [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=618.24s)]
*  that military experts and defense officials say probably was by design [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=623.08s)]
*  let's emphasize that part as well there would note the fact that there was no [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=629.24s)]
*  damage was an inaccuracy level that military experts and defense officials [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=634.44s)]
*  say was probably by design so unlike the Israeli attack on Iran which blew up [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=639.84s)]
*  their building and killed their senior officials the Iranians responded in the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=647.24s)]
*  most harmless and benign way possible on purpose by not using their most [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=652.76s)]
*  powerful weapons by not using fighter jets by not shooting missiles from [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=658.0s)]
*  Hezbollah their proxy which has over a hundred thousand highly precise missiles [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=664.04s)]
*  aimed at almost virtually every Israeli city there's no doubt Iran could cause a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=670.0s)]
*  lot of damage inside Israel if it wanted to and the reason it didn't was because [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=675.8s)]
*  they purposely use the kinds of drones and missiles with advanced warning [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=682.32s)]

*  perception that what the United States was doing in Ukraine the promises to [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1401.6000000000001s)]
*  up to the Russian border was a threat to the Russians and here's what Harris [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1406.32s)]
*  Faulkner and Condoleezza Rice had to say about that Russian invasion [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1411.32s)]
*  well and I have argued that when you invade a sovereign nation that is a war crime [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1417.32s)]
*  I mean I think we're at just a real basic basic point there well I'd agree it is [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1421.32s)]
*  certainly against every principle of international law and international order [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1426.32s)]
*  and that's why throwing the book at them now in terms of economic sanctions and [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1431.04s)]
*  punishments is also a part of it and I think the world is there certainly NATO [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1436.04s)]
*  is there he's he's managed to unite NATO in ways that I didn't think I would [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1440.72s)]
*  ever see again after the end of the Cold War really yeah yeah let me just play [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1444.72s)]
*  that question again that cause Condoleezza Rice to nod in agreement I [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1449.8799999999999s)]
*  have argued that when you invade a sovereign nation that is a war crime I [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1454.04s)]
*  mean I think we're at just a real basic basic point there well so she's saying [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1458.92s)]
*  to Condoleezza Rice just as a general principle in fact Harris Faulkner [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1463.92s)]
*  saying it's so obvious like self-evident that if you invade a sovereign country [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1468.32s)]
*  by definition you're a war criminal you're committing a war crime and she's [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1473.68s)]
*  saying this to Condoleezza Rice and I think neither of them have any conscious [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1479.04s)]
*  sense that the behavior they're condemning is behavior in which [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1486.24s)]
*  Condoleezza Rice was centrally involved and you can always question is this just [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1492.36s)]
*  a cynical and Machiavellian attempt to use propaganda while understanding fully [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1500.84s)]
*  what they're doing I don't think it is that I think people like Condoleezza Rice [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1505.1200000000001s)]
*  and Harris Faulkner who are so drowning in American propaganda for so long are [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1509.68s)]
*  incapable of seeing anything outside of it and so they really do believe that [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1515.84s)]
*  when Russia invades Ukraine that makes the officials responsible war criminals [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1521.9599999999998s)]
*  and they're incapable of applying that rationale to what they did in Iraq the [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1527.1599999999999s)]
*  human brain should not be capable of that kind of self-negation and yet you [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1534.6s)]
*  see it all the time American officials go around condemning Russia for having [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1539.52s)]
*  relationships with repressive regimes when the closest American allies are [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1545.72s)]
*  some of the most savage brutal dictatorships in the world like Saudi [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1552.0s)]
*  Arabia and Egypt and there's just no sense of that contradiction at all [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1556.24s)]
*  because the United States and top foreign policymakers really do believe [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1562.32s)]
*  that the standards they impose on other countries don't apply to themselves and [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1567.52s)]
*  the problem with that is that the rest of the world increasingly is becoming [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1571.48s)]
*  very resentful of that and increasingly because of the role of multipolarity and [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1577.24s)]
*  the rise of an alternative alliance led by China and BRICS these countries have [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1582.48s)]
*  the opportunity now to express that resentment and increasingly are moving [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1587.88s)]
*  toward China which expertly exploits this kind of resentment but it's just [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1593.48s)]
*  amazing to watch in such explicit form and the idea that Iran somehow did [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1599.2s)]
*  something evil and outside of the bounds of decency and responding to the bombing [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1604.6000000000001s)]
*  of their embassy when every single country on the planet certainly United [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1609.24s)]
*  States and the UK would have not just responded but far more aggressively and [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1612.64s)]
*  violently and destructively than what the Iranians did is so illustrative of [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1617.16s)]
*  how countries even ones that don't like to think of themselves at this way are [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1623.3600000000001s)]
*  propagandized to the point where people inside of that system can't even [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1629.64s)]
*  critically evaluated any longer [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BvyZ0FmjJg&t=1634.64s)]
