# What Surprises Glenn About this Trump Admin
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA)
*  Alright, next question. Bentley2 asked, Glenn, I was wrong about Trump and what he would [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=0.0s)]
*  do. I disbelieve the mainstream news media depiction that Trump was a severe threat to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=13.0s)]
*  democracy. Can you admit that you misjudged Trump? All of that is way too sweeping, I [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=17.48s)]
*  think, with respect to be able to just say yes or no to. I understand the sentiment. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=23.44s)]
*  I guess I would acknowledge that some of the methods and tactics that the Trump administration [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=32.72s)]
*  has resorted to almost immediately has surprised me just in terms of how extreme they are. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=40.16s)]
*  Deporting green card holders who are married to American citizens or PhD students because [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=48.88s)]
*  they wrote an op-ed against Israel, creating this framework that anybody should be afraid [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=56.28s)]
*  of criticizing Israel because the US government is showing that they will punish you. It's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=64.04s)]
*  not just foreign citizens either, by the way, it's also Americans as well. The Trump administration, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  when they submitted their demands to Colombia, demanded that Colombia as a condition to even [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=72.88s)]
*  talking about receiving the funding that was frozen, they required them to suspend, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=76.96s)]
*  severely suspend or expel everybody who participated anyway in the protest against the Israeli [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=83.63999999999999s)]
*  war in Gaza. As a result, Americans, American born Americans have been expelled because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  the government demanded it. The government has also demanded the introduction and implementation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  of a radically expanded definition of anti-Semitism that makes you in violation of campus rules [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  if you criticize Israel in a way that this radical definition that has been adopted in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=106.92s)]
*  the EU that was promulgated by Israel renders prohibited. So it's not just foreign students [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=114.88s)]
*  who are being deported, it's also American institutions, American academia, American [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  students who are being punished by this attempt to really outlaw and criminalize and intimidate [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=126.12s)]
*  people out of criticizing Israel. So that is one thing that I did not expect them to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=132.44s)]
*  do but at the same time, you can look at other things that they're doing that are shocking [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=140.56s)]
*  to me, like invoking the Alien Enemies Act to try and proclaim that the US is at war [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=145.84s)]
*  with a small violent group of thugs and gang members from Venezuela. We're at war, like [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=156.6s)]
*  we were in World War I or World War II, we're the War of 1812 so that you can now invoke [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  wartime powers enacted in the late 18th century that has barely been enacted throughout American [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  even when it was, the people who they wanted to deport got hearings to be able to demonstrate [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=182.54s)]
*  that they weren't actually Nazi sympathizers, weren't actually threats to the national security [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=188.22s)]
*  and the Trump administration is not just deporting people with no hearing of any kind, they're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=192.78s)]
*  not deporting them at all. Deporting means sending them back to their home, they're deporting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=197.89999999999998s)]
*  them quote unquote by throwing them into a uniquely repressive, abusive prison in El Salvador, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=201.1s)]
*  paying for them to be in prison, being kept there indefinitely to the point where El [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=209.86s)]
*  Salvador is saying they may stay here for life all without a shred of due process for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  them to say, wait a minute, I'm not the person you think I am, it's a case of mistaken identity [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=218.46s)]
*  or you misread my tattoos, some process to make sure that we're not imprisoning for life [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  people who are totally innocent. And so I do think, I will acknowledge that the speed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  of this stuff and the aggression with which it's carried out did surprise me, I probably [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=237.1s)]
*  would have said I don't think the Trump administration would do that at all or certainly not as quickly [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=242.94s)]
*  as they've done. At the same time, they have, Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  that he would do this, you can watch speeches where he says I'm going to invoke the Alien [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=254.1s)]
*  Enemies Act and mass deport people and we're going to go after foreign students and revoke [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=259.54s)]
*  their visas who participated in protests against Israel. So I think these things are anti-democratic, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=264.86s)]
*  I think they're a violation of the Bill of Rights, I expect or at least hope and I would [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=271.42s)]
*  say expect at least in some cases that our federal courts, including the Supreme Court, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=276.58s)]
*  will rule that some of these things are a violation of the Constitution. What I have [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=281.3s)]
*  problem with is this binary assessment that Trump is a severe threat to democracy because [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=285.42s)]
*  you can look at the Biden administration and I do think many things that they did, including [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=295.82s)]
*  their systemic campaign to have the CIA and Homeland Security and the NIH bully and pressure [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=302.26s)]
*  and coerce, big tack to ban dissent from their pronouncements on things like COVID in Ukraine [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=308.86s)]
*  was as unconstitutional and as severe of a threat to our Bill of Rights as anything the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=317.62s)]
*  Trump administration is doing. I don't think you can say one is worse than the next. So [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=322.34s)]
*  I'm still, again we're two months into the administration, two months, just a little [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=328.26s)]
*  over and I don't think I've been coy about the serious alarm that I have about many of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=333.09999999999997s)]
*  the things the Trump administration has been doing, re-initiating the war in Gaza, restarting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=341.05999999999995s)]
*  and then escalating the bombing campaign in Yemen using rules of engagement that assign [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=346.73999999999995s)]
*  almost zero value to civilian life in Yemen. To say nothing of these deportations, these [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=351.1s)]
*  attacks on American institutions, I think the attempt to force law firms to restructure [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=357.86s)]
*  their pro bono program, to promise hundreds of millions of dollars of free work in defense [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=365.86s)]
*  of the Trump administration, demanding that they do pro bono work on anti-Semitism specifically, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=370.12s)]
*  like a DEI program just today, earlier today, Skadden Arps, one of the biggest, most powerful [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=377.32s)]
*  firms on the planet, that wasn't even targeted yet with an executive order by Trump, but [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=383.2s)]
*  preemptively reached an agreement with the White House that was chilling and creepy. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=388.68s)]
*  Where they're promising not to do certain kind of pro bono work, promising to do other [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=395.48s)]
*  types in a way that aligns with Trump's political agenda. Forcing major law firms to restructure [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=399.2s)]
*  law firms to submit to and promise to work for free for Trump's political vision. I do [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=407.12s)]
*  think a lot of these things are creepy and threatening and anti-democratic, but I also [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=415.32s)]
*  did shows before the election, several on how many people on the right, many in the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump circle who proclaim to believe in free speech actually have a gigantic Israel exception. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=427.96s)]
*  I did an entire show on what the likely influence of Miriam Adelson's $100 million dollars [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=432.0s)]
*  of the Trump campaign would be. I highlighted how Trump officials and people around him [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=436.96s)]
*  were vowing to deport students for the crime of criticizing Israel, protesting Israel. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's not like my vision of Trump pre-election was this kind of anti-war pacifist, fully [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  devoted defender of free speech and civil liberties. There's obvious dangers to Trump. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=460.84s)]
*  I just think that the rhetoric of depicting Biden or George W. Bush or Obama as these [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=466.12s)]
*  kind of beacons of nobility and devotees of American democracy in contrast to Trump who's [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=474.36s)]
*  just this anti-democratic monster unlike the thing we've ever seen before, I think that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=480.54s)]
*  is what has been wildly overblown and I still think that. Despite the fact that I'm certainly [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=485.6s)]
*  willing to admit that presidents stand up all the time or candidates stand up all the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=491.44s)]
*  time and vow to do things on the campaign trail and then don't do them, as I said I'm [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=495.62s)]
*  willing to admit that it has surprised me not just the velocity but the intensity, the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=499.7s)]
*  extremism, the aggression with which they're carrying out what I regard as obvious assaults [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=507.54s)]
*  on the Bill of Rights. And the way in which Trump supporters are willing to basically [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=514.58s)]
*  say or do anything to justify anything that the administration does, I mean it took them [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=521.74s)]
*  eight weeks, it took MAGA eight weeks to go from what they've been saying for years. No [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=526.58s)]
*  more Mideast wars, F the military industrial complex, no more endless war, keep that money [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=532.22s)]
*  here at home for our own citizens and then Trump restarts Biden's bombing campaign of [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=540.72s)]
*  Yemen even though in 2024 Trump said he opposed Biden's bombing of Yemen and that was when [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=547.1s)]
*  the Houthis were actually attacking US ships, they're not attacking US ships now but Trump [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=552.9s)]
*  greenlit the massive escalation and bombing of them killing lots of civilians and suddenly [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=557.82s)]
*  MAGA is like yeah take those, take them down. Like to do such an about face of the things [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=562.62s)]
*  that you say you believed in, have some integrity, like have some duty as a citizen. Even if [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=567.38s)]
*  you support your leader still, even if you love him, even if you want him to be straightened, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=575.38s)]
*  stand up and say when you think he's doing something against what you said your values [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=580.66s)]
*  are. Same with the censorship thing, I can't tell you how many times a day I hear Trump [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=584.46s)]
*  supporters saying only American citizens have rights under the Constitution no matter how [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=588.54s)]
*  much you show them. The Supreme Court has said for 150 years or more that everybody [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=593.8s)]
*  under US government control including even illegal aliens but certainly people illegally [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  in the United States have the protections of the Bill of Rights, they'll never stop [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  saying it because they need to say it to defend what Trump is doing. Going from we love free [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  speech, free speech is the most important thing, to yeah get these Israel critics out [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  of our country, punish the colleges and universities that allow too much Israel criticism, punish [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  American citizens who are students if they protest against Israel and then you just turn [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=626.72s)]
*  on a dime and they're like yeah censorship, that kind of censorship that's really good [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=633.72s)]
*  but it goes back to what I was saying before about the primacy of Israel but also the willingness [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=636.72s)]
*  not of all Trump supporters or not of all MAG-UP supporters and not even all Democrats [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=641.72s)]
*  to justify everything their party and their president is doing but this is typically how [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=646.72s)]
*  our politics works. My first experience with that was I started blogging in 2005 and my [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=652.08s)]
*  focus almost exclusively was on denouncing Bush and Cheney and the neocons and their [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=658.32s)]
*  civil liberties assault under the war on terror and I built up this huge audience, some libertarians, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=663.28s)]
*  good number of libertarians but primarily Democrats and liberals who were just so happy [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=671.08s)]
*  somebody was vocally denouncing Bush and Cheney on these issues and in 2009 comes and Obama [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  gets inaugurated and he continues a lot of these same programs he vowed to uproot that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=680.72s)]
*  I had been criticizing and even strengthens and extends some of them beyond where even [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=686.96s)]
*  Bush and Cheney took them and I've obviously continued to criticize Obama on the same grounds [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  that I had been criticizing Bush and Cheney for the same policies and a huge number of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=697.12s)]
*  them were like wait a minute we didn't really believe in that, we were just happy you were [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKkAwQTniA&t=700.32s)]
