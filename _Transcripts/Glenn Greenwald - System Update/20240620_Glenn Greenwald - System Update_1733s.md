# Revealed: Secret Pentagon Anti-Vax Campaign Discredited Chinese COVID Vaccine
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g)
*  One of the most bizarre things that I've seen in my almost 20 years working as a journalist covering American politics and American wars and the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=0.0s)]
*  security state has been the hysteria that emerged about Russia in the middle of the 2016 presidential campaign, a narrative obviously used to try and sabotage the campaign of Donald Trump by falsely accusing them of having collaborated with the Russian government. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=16.0s)]
*  But one of the anchors of this claim was that Russia had done something extraordinary and unprecedentedly evil, which is that they had used fake Twitter profiles and a few Facebook pages and bots to spread what media calls disinformation to American voters, namely trying to confuse them or trying to mislead them and particularly trying to drive them to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=33.64s)]
*  Now, one of the reasons it was so mystifying and bizarre to watch that propaganda and the media really seemed to believe it earnestly was because the idea that what Russia had done there, interfering in our sacred democracy through the use of these online information campaigns, that that was somehow unprecedented and interfering in our democracy is that everybody knows who has the most minimal knowledge of American history, that the United States has spent decades interfering in virtually [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=60.64s)]
*  every other country, in their internal affairs, in their internal politics, obviously including Russia, using exactly those same tactics as well as far worse ones. And there are plenty of examples, as we're about to show you, where the United States basically replicated what Russia did or is alleged to have done in 2016, long before Russia ever did that in multiple other countries all around the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=90.64s)]
*  But Reuters last week produced what I have to call an excellent piece of investigative journalism. It is so rare these days for corporate media outlets to actually denounce what our own government is doing or to disclose the secret misconduct of our own government. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=112.64s)]
*  So often it's just all about denouncing these countries on the other side of the world through the United States government tells us we should hate, that does nothing. But this is what the role of the American media is supposed to be, is being adversarial to our own government. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=128.64s)]
*  And the investigation that they produced and the revelations that they published are really extraordinary. I had read it last week. I kind of took note of it, but I really delve into it over the last 48 hours. I appeared on breaking points this morning where I talked about it and that kind of made me focus even more on the implications of the story. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=141.64s)]
*  And I started realizing that it had much more importance and is much more amazing than I had initially realized when I began looking at it. So first of all, let me show you the key items of the Reuters report, what Reuters revealed on June 14. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=160.64s)]
*  June 14. There you see the headline. The Pentagon ran a secret anti-vax campaign to undermine China during the pandemic. The U.S. military launched a clandestine program amid the COVID crisis to discredit China's Sinovac inoculation, payback for Beijing's efforts to blame Washington for the pandemic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=175.64s)]
*  One target was the Filipino public. Health experts say the gambit was indefensible and put innocent lives at risk. Now, let me just stop here and give you the context for what was happening. As all of you know, the United States government was insisting that the vaccine that Pfizer and other big pharmaceutical companies had produced was urgent and necessary for everyone to take, that it was the only way to get the vaccine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=197.64s)]
*  There was no other way to stop the pandemic. There were all kinds of claims by prominent media personalities who claimed they combat disinformation like Rachel Maddow, who notoriously said, if you take this vaccine, you cannot contract the virus. That means it stops at you and you can no longer spread it. That was the claim. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=227.64s)]
*  So, attempts to make it completely taboo to question whether there was any, there were any dangers or risks to this previously untested vaccine, this vaccine that was created in a very short period of time. It was really an experimental vaccine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=247.64s)]
*  And one of the things the United States government did when it negotiated with all these big pharmaceutical companies is it was using the America first ideology of Trump and the negotiation and the agreement that the United States government reached was you are going to prioritize American citizens, make sure American citizens get this vaccine first, and you're going to sell it to United States and to American citizens at a very, very low rate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=262.64s)]
*  As a result, in exchange, you're permitted to sell to the rest of the world and gouge them on whatever prices you want. So you give it to the US for 30 cents a vaccine, you can sell it to the rest of the world for $10 or $20 a vaccine if you want. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=288.64s)]
*  And what that meant was that there were a lot of very poor countries that could not afford to buy the vaccine. And we were being told, remember that everyone taking the vaccine was necessary to stop the pandemic, that people who refused to take the vaccine were killers of your grandmother. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=306.64s)]
*  That was the message that the US government was spreading. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=323.64s)]
*  And so China saw that there were a lot of these poor countries that could not afford the vaccines of Western pharmaceutical companies and so they offered to donate their own vaccine that was showing the same amount of efficacy as the American vaccine to these poor countries like the Philippines and countries in the Middle East. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=328.64s)]
*  In part because China wanted this vaccine to stop, in part because they understand that if they are seen providing assistance to poor countries that will give them an opening to be better liked, that's something the United States has used for a long time, that's what foreign aid is for, there's some disaster in India. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=349.64s)]
*  And the US government announces we're sending $100 million to help the people of India and then obviously the idea is that the people of India will perceive us in a better light. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=370.64s)]
*  But whatever the motives, the Chinese government was going to provide and was providing free or basically free vaccines to all these poor countries, including the Philippines and the Middle East that needed them and they could not get them from the West because they were too expensive to get them from the West. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=380.64s)]
*  And the United States government, while on the one hand, insisting that taking the vaccine was so crucial that people should be fired or prevented from leaving their house if they refuse to do so and that anyone questioning the vaccine online should be censored and banned and they were. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=397.64s)]
*  On the one hand that was their message, on the other, they didn't want China to be able to gain influence in these countries by giving their vaccine for free and so they created an online clandestine disinformation campaign. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=415.64s)]
*  They weren't spreading valid doubts or claims about the Chinese COVID vaccine. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=426.64s)]
*  They were spreading false claims about the Chinese COVID vaccine to spread doubt and fear and skepticism among these poor people who could only get it through the Chinese vaccine and therefore encouraging them not to get it and that was an effort to prevent China from gaining influence in those countries. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=433.64s)]
*  And they used all the things the Russian used, online bots, fake Twitter profiles, fake Facebook profiles, and this is what Reuters was able to reveal. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=449.64s)]
*  It goes on, quote, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=459.64s)]
*  Social media posts decried the quality of face masks, test kits, and the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines, China's Sinovac inoculation. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=478.64s)]
*  Reuters identified at least 300 accounts on X, formerly Twitter, that matched description shared by former US military officials familiar with the Philippine operation. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=493.64s)]
*  Almost all were created in the summer of 2020 and centered on the slogan, hashtag China, China virus. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=503.64s)]
*  Is that China? Yeah, China. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=511.64s)]
*  China and virus, which means essentially China is the virus in Tagalog, the language of the Philippines. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=514.64s)]
*  Now, quote, the Reuters account goes on, quote, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=523.64s)]
*  Reuters found even after alarm social media executives warned the new administration that the Pentagon had been trafficking in COVID misinformation. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=553.64s)]
*  A senior Defense Department official acknowledged the US military engaged in secret propaganda to disparage Chinese vaccine in the developing world, but the official declined to provide details. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=573.64s)]
*  So they admitted they were doing it when Reuters discovered it, but declined to provide details. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=583.64s)]
*  A Pentagon spokeswoman said the US military, quote, uses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attack aimed at US allies and partners. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=588.64s)]
*  Not sure what that has to do with spreading anti-vax messages in developing parts of the world at the same time that the US government was forcing its own citizens to take the vaccine and preventing any attempt to question it, destroying the reputation of anyone who was, quote, anti-vax. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=600.64s)]
*  When it turns out one of the most prolific spreaders of anti-vax messaging among the poorest populations that were most vulnerable to COVID was the US government itself. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=617.64s)]
*  The Reuters account investigation goes on, quote, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=627.64s)]
*  Quote, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=630.64s)]
*  Reuters found similar posts that trace back to the US Central Command. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=661.64s)]
*  One shows a Chinese flag as a curtain separating Muslim woman in hijabs and pigs stuck with vaccine syringes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=665.64s)]
*  In the center is a man with syringes on his back is the word China. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=673.64s)]
*  It targeted Central Asia, including Kazakhstan's Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, a country that distributed tens of millions of doses of China's vaccines and participated in human trials. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=677.64s)]
*  Translated into English, the ex-post reads, quote, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=690.64s)]
*  China distributes a vaccine made of pork gelatin. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=693.64s)]
*  Now, obviously, there are a lot of people in the United States, especially now, who distrust the COVID vaccine, who believe that the COVID vaccine is both dangerous and ineffective. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=698.64s)]
*  So what is so notable here, other than the fact that the US, yet again, was using exactly the kind of fake, deceived, concealed online disinformation campaigns through fake Twitter bots and Facebook pages and profiles that it claimed only Russia uses, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=708.64s)]
*  was the fact that the position of the US government is that this vaccine saves lives and that everyone needs to take it as the only way out of the pandemic. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=726.64s)]
*  And at the same time, they were publicly claiming that and putting all kinds of mandates on American citizens to take the vaccine. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=735.64s)]
*  They were doing exactly the opposite in the developing parts of the world, all to prevent China from gaining influence in those countries, even if it meant, as they anticipated, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=742.64s)]
*  that millions of people or hundreds of thousands of people would die in those countries because they were encouraged by the US government not to take the vaccine. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=753.64s)]
*  Now, just as a reminder of the context, the New York Times in August of 2021 reported the headline there, China says it will provide two billion vaccine doses to the world. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=762.64s)]
*  The pledge, which included a hundred million dollar donation to COVAX, intensifies competition with the US over leadership and ending the pandemic. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=777.64s)]
*  China's top leader, Xi Jinping, said the country would provide two billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to the world this year and would donate a hundred million dollars to global efforts to distribute the doses to developing countries as Beijing attempts to take on a more prominent leadership role in curbing the pandemic. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=785.64s)]
*  Mr. Xi's pledges were announced on Thursday in a written message to an international COVID-19 vaccine cooperation forum chaired by the Chinese government. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=802.64s)]
*  Quote, China will continue to do everything it can to help developing countries cope with the epidemic. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=810.64s)]
*  And it was exactly that. Chinese aid to these impoverished countries to give them the vaccine, which was the only way they could get it, that the US government was trying to sabotage. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=818.64s)]
*  Through this campaign of deceitful online campaigns, giving false claims about the Chinese vaccine. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=829.64s)]
*  Now, just to remind you what the US government was saying in public about people who were spreading vaccine skepticism or anti-vax messaging. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=835.64s)]
*  Listen to what Joe Biden said about people doing that in July of 2021. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=844.64s)]
*  I mean, it really looks the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated and that's in there and they're killing people. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=859.64s)]
*  Joe Biden in public accused Facebook of killing people. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=870.64s)]
*  Because the US government was claiming that Facebook wasn't censoring enough. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=874.64s)]
*  That they weren't removing enough content that questioned the vaccine. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=879.64s)]
*  The US government accused Facebook of killing people by allowing anti-vax messaging to circulate. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=884.64s)]
*  And yet at the same time that Biden was saying that, that whoever spreads anti-vax messaging is guilty of murder, the US government was doing exactly that in secret to the poorest people in the world. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=890.64s)]
*  Now, one of the ironies of what Biden said there as well was that part of the Reuters investigation showed that Facebook actually discovered, as did Twitter, detected this false government backed social media campaign. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=903.64s)]
*  And saw that these were bots and fake profiles. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=918.64s)]
*  And the Pentagon, and Facebook rather, went to the US government indignant saying you spent months badgering us to remove anti-vax content, to ban people from questioning the vaccine. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=921.64s)]
*  And now you have this program to disseminate anti-vax messaging to the poorest people in the world. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=934.64s)]
*  And the US government said please don't take down those profiles. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=941.64s)]
*  We spent a lot of money to build those. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=945.64s)]
*  We promised that we won't use them regarding COVID anymore. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=947.64s)]
*  And they promised that and then Facebook noticed that the US government was continuing to use those fake accounts to spread this anti-vax messaging. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=950.64s)]
*  Here from CNN, just to give you a reminder of what we were told about how evil the Russians were for using a few fake Twitter profiles and Facebook bots. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=959.64s)]
*  CNN, December of 2018, Russians sought to recruit, quote, assets through social media, the Senate was told. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=973.64s)]
*  The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to release two reports on Monday detailing the breadth of the Russian social media campaign to sow discord in the United States. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=980.64s)]
*  All of the major social media platforms were used as part of the campaign, the report said, but new knowledge found in 2017, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=989.64s)]
*  as investigators and reporters began unearthing the Russian social media campaign on the two platforms that use most Facebook and Twitter, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=997.64s)]
*  quote, the IRA, that's the Russian agency that was accused of spreading this disinformation campaign, the IRA shifted much of its activity to Instagram. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1004.64s)]
*  The spread of disinformation on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has received less scrutiny than it has on other platforms, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1013.64s)]
*  quote, the most prolific IRA efforts on Facebook and Instagram specifically targeted black American communities and appear to have focused on developing black audiences and recruiting black audiences as assets, the report noted. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1019.64s)]
*  It's just unbelievable that corporate media over and over and over depicted Russia as engaging in some kind of never-before-seen attack on our democracy by using these tactics that the United States has reused over and over and over again. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1034.64s)]
*  And they did so, these corporate media outlets did, without ever noting that the United States has always engaged in this kind of interference in the internal affairs of other countries using these exact tactics and more. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1050.64s)]
*  Here from Politico, this is an actual article that Politico published in July of 2018. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1062.64s)]
*  It has this headline, Putin's attack on the US is our Pearl Harbor. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1068.64s)]
*  Make no mistake, hacking the 2016 election was an act of war. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1073.64s)]
*  It's time we responded accordingly by Mark Hurtling and Molly McHugh. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1078.64s)]
*  Quote, the Mueller indictments have pulled back the curtain on enough of the details that we should see how much we still don't know but need to. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1085.64s)]
*  They show the extent to which Russia has learned to, quote, hack our systems using these hybrid asymmetric means with an emerging and polished cyber capability at its core. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1092.64s)]
*  They are, in short, working us using our social media and free press to manipulate opinion, using willing collaborators to act on their behalf using a degraded trust in government institutions and the free press. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1102.64s)]
*  To sour further confusion and distrust. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1114.64s)]
*  They are winning using covert deceptive means and it's all completely out in the open while remaining totally invisible. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1117.64s)]
*  It's actually unbelievable. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1126.64s)]
*  Just five years previously, there was a report in the Guardian in July of 2011 that revealed as the headline says the CIA organized a fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family's DNA. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1129.64s)]
*  Senior Pakistani doctor who organized vaccine programs in Pakistan and arrested by ISI for working with US agents. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1147.64s)]
*  So just to give you the context here, the US wanted to find bin Laden inside Pakistan and they recruited the people who had been going around for years convincing Pakistanis to not be so suspicious of vaccines, including against polio. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1156.64s)]
*  And they finally made progress in convincing Pakistanis to trust the vaccine they were given to not think of it as some kind of plot by the West to poison them. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1172.64s)]
*  And then the US government goes and deceitfully uses this vaccine registration campaign to spy on Pakistanis. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1184.64s)]
*  Quote as part of extensive preparation for the raid that killed bin Laden in May CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organize the vaccine drive. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1195.64s)]
*  And even starting the quote project in a poor part of town to make it look more authentic according to Pakistani and US officials and local residents. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1204.64s)]
*  The vaccination plan was conceived after American intelligence officers tracked an al Qaeda courier known as Abu Ahmad al Qawabi to what turned out to be bin Laden's compound last summer. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1212.64s)]
*  The doctor went to Abbottabad in March saying he had procured funds to give free vaccinations for hepatitis B. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1224.64s)]
*  Bypassing the management of the health services he paid generous sums to low ranking local government health workers who took part in the operation without knowing about the connection to bin Laden. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1233.64s)]
*  Health visitors in the area were among the few people who had gained access to bin Laden compound in the past, administering polio drops to some of the children. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1243.64s)]
*  Now in response to that those revelations helped workers around the world were enraged at what the US was doing. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1251.64s)]
*  Spreading suspicions about polio vaccines by using the program to spy on Pakistanis after decades of efforts to try and convince Pakistanis that they should trust the polio vaccine. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1258.64s)]
*  Polio is a horrific but completely avoidable disease that ravages children. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1269.64s)]
*  And the US spread skepticism about that vaccine by doing that. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1274.64s)]
*  And in response to the revelation that the US had been spreading anti-vax messaging in the poor parts of the world that Reuters published, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1279.64s)]
*  it turns out that at least six senior health officials inside the US government resigned in anger over what the US government had done. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1292.64s)]
*  And then they even went and interviewed the kinds of experts that are very pro-Falchi that were defending Falchi and the health establishment all the time. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1301.64s)]
*  And when they found out what the US was doing, even they said, this is morally repugnant. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1311.64s)]
*  We were basically encouraging people all over the world not to take the COVID vaccine. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1317.64s)]
*  Now here is just to give you kind of more history on how much the US has always done this from AP in April of 2014. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1324.64s)]
*  The US secretly built a Cuban Twitter in order to stir unrest. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1334.64s)]
*  Quote, the US government masterminded the creation of a quote Cuban Twitter, a communications network designed to undermine the communist government in Cuba, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1340.64s)]
*  Cuba built with secret shell companies and financed through foreign banks, the Associated Press has learned. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1348.64s)]
*  The Obama administration project, which lasted more than two years and drew tens of thousands of subscribers, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1353.64s)]
*  sought to evade Cuba's stranglehold on the Internet with a primitive social media platform. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1358.64s)]
*  First, the network would build a Cuban audience, mostly young people. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1364.64s)]
*  Then the plan was to push them toward dissent. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1367.64s)]
*  Yet its users were neither aware it was created by a US agency with ties to the State Department, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1370.64s)]
*  nor that American contractors were gathering personal data about them in the hope that the information might be used someday for political purposes. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1375.64s)]
*  Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey currently yet again, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1383.64s)]
*  indicted and facing felony charges for bribery and other corruption, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1387.64s)]
*  who was also the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1391.64s)]
*  said the USAID, the agency connected with the CIA and the State Department should be applauded [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1395.64s)]
*  for giving people in Cuba a platform to talk to each other. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1402.64s)]
*  Quote, the whole purpose of our democracy programs, whether it be in Cuba or other parts of the world, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1405.64s)]
*  is in part to create a free flow of information in closed societies. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1409.64s)]
*  So they created what was essentially a fake Twitter network in Cuba to lure young Cubans into using it, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1416.64s)]
*  thinking they were using a real social media account without realizing it was actually being run [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1423.64s)]
*  and contaminated by the US government to deceive them and manipulate them through anti-government messaging. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1428.64s)]
*  It's not just the US government that does that, it's also the Israeli government. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1434.64s)]
*  In March of 2023, so six months before the October 7th attack, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1439.64s)]
*  AP reported, quote, Israeli army admits to a covert influence campaign in Gaza war. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1445.64s)]
*  Quote, days into Israel's devastating war with Gaza militants in 2021, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1451.64s)]
*  they had a war with Gaza in 2021 and many other years, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1457.64s)]
*  the Israeli army began deploying keyboard warriors to a second front, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1460.64s)]
*  a covert social media operation to praise the military's bombing campaign in the coastal enclave. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1465.64s)]
*  The Israeli military acknowledged Wednesday that it made a, quote, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1471.64s)]
*  mistake in launching the secretive influence campaign on social media in an effort to improve Israel's, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1474.64s)]
*  the Israeli public's view of Israel's performance in the conflict. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1480.64s)]
*  Israel's Haaretz Daly first exposed the social media operation on Wednesday, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1485.64s)]
*  reporting that the army employed fake accounts to conceal the campaign's origin [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1489.64s)]
*  and engage audiences on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1494.64s)]
*  It seems that the Israeli expression of regret and remorse was not exactly sincere, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1499.64s)]
*  given the fact that just 10 days ago, an exact replica of this Israeli influence campaign [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1506.64s)]
*  was revealed, though this time it was directed at United States lawmakers and American citizens [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1514.64s)]
*  designed to deceive them into having a more positive view of Israel than they had [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1519.64s)]
*  by manipulating them with fake Twitter and Facebook profiles. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1524.64s)]
*  Here from the New York Times, Israel secretly targets U.S. lawmakers with influence campaign on the Gaza war. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1528.64s)]
*  Quote, Israel's minister of diaspora affairs ordered the operation, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1535.64s)]
*  which used fake social media accounts urging U.S. lawmakers to fund Israel's military, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1539.64s)]
*  according to officials and documents about the effort. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1544.64s)]
*  Israel organized and paid for an influence campaign last year targeting U.S. lawmakers [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1548.64s)]
*  and the American public with pro-Israel messaging as it aimed to foster support [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1553.64s)]
*  for its actions in the war in Gaza, according to officials involved. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1557.64s)]
*  The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel's ministry of diaspora affairs, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1562.64s)]
*  a government body that connects Jews around the world with the state of Israel. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1566.64s)]
*  The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation and hired Stoick, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1570.64s)]
*  a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv, to curate it out, according to officials and the documents. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1574.64s)]
*  The campaign began in October and remains active on the platform X. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1579.64s)]
*  At its peak, it used hundreds of fake accounts that posed as real Americans on X, Facebook, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1584.64s)]
*  and Instagram to post pro-Israeli comments. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1589.64s)]
*  The accounts focused on U.S. lawmakers, particularly ones who are black and Democrats, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1593.64s)]
*  such as Representative Hakim Jeffries, the House Minority Leader from New York, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1598.64s)]
*  and Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, with posts urging them to continue funding Israel's military. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1602.64s)]
*  ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, was used to generate many of the posts. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1608.64s)]
*  The campaign also created three fake English-language news sites featuring pro-Israel articles. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1614.64s)]
*  Again, it is remarkable what was done in 2016 and what is going to be done again in 2024, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1621.64s)]
*  trying to get Americans completely enraged over Russia's secret campaigns online [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1628.64s)]
*  to influence American public opinion when the United States has been doing this over and over and over again, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1635.64s)]
*  as has Israel, aimed at American citizens and what they think, as well as other countries. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1640.64s)]
*  But in this case, what was so amazing about this U.S. secret manipulation campaign of public opinion [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1646.64s)]
*  is that they were encouraging en masse people to be doubtful and cynical and resistant to a COVID vaccine, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1653.64s)]
*  acts which in public, the U.S. government said, was basically the expression of murder, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1661.64s)]
*  that those acts kill people. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1671.64s)]
*  At the same time that the Pentagon was demanding and mandating and requiring that Americans take this vaccine [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1674.64s)]
*  and censoring and banning any efforts to question the vaccine, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1680.64s)]
*  in secret the U.S. government was working as hard as they could to prevent the poorest people on the planet [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1685.64s)]
*  from taking this vaccine, willing to sacrifice the lives of hundreds of thousands or millions of people [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1690.64s)]
*  in their effort to try and ensure that China wasn't perceived in a more positive way [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1697.64s)]
*  because they were offering the vaccine for free. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuZ3A1OH3g&t=1702.64s)]
