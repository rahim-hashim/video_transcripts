# Vivek Weighs-in on Censorship Crisis, Israel, Presidential Pardons, & More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw)
*  The thing I knew about you before you even ran for president was first you had written [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=0.0s)]
*  a Wall Street Journal article, co-authored and op-ed, arguing that this censorship regime [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=10.4s)]
*  where the government pressures big tech to control online speech is unconstitutional. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=15.48s)]
*  I think it proved very prescient given the court rulings we've had saying that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=20.36s)]
*  You then wrote a book, Woke, Inc., where you advanced even further, more passionately, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  in this defense of free speech, both online and in terms of our political culture. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=28.56s)]
*  And then you wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal at the start of the Hamas-Israel [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  War saying we're not going to defeat Hamas through cancel culture. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=36.48s)]
*  Since October 7th, we've had this kind of spate of censorship, state censorship in the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=40.0s)]
*  West and kind of informal cancel culture. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=45.96s)]
*  Lots of people have been fired, some for excessively supporting Israel, but mostly for people who [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=48.44s)]
*  have criticized Israel excessively. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  What is your view of free speech issues like this in terms of the role that it'll play [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=56.76s)]
*  in the Republican primary? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=60.36s)]
*  Look, the role it'll play in the Republican primary, I mean, that's for political analysts, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=62.4s)]
*  Glenn, but my job in this is I'm a candidate. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=67.56s)]
*  I'm going to share my convictions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  And I think I'm the only candidate in this field that is a true free speech advocate [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=71.36s)]
*  to the core. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=76.96s)]
*  I object to governmental backdoor intrusions into free speech, and most of this was coming [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=78.12s)]
*  from the left. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=82.97999999999999s)]
*  At the time that I wrote Woke, Inc. in that first op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  you referenced, it came at some great personal sacrifice. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  After that very first piece I wrote, Glenn, two advisors to my company, and I was still [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=90.92s)]
*  a CEO of a biotech company at this time, two prominent advisors to my company resigned [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=95.28s)]
*  for making this argument defending free speech in the aftermath of January 6, 2021. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  And so I have been a crusader against left-wing cancel culture and remain so today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=106.0s)]
*  But I apply that principle 360 degrees. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=111.12s)]
*  I don't care if you agree with me or not, you have the right to say it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=113.74s)]
*  And I believe much of our Republican primary voter base cares about that deeply, but it's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=117.66s)]
*  going to take somebody who's willing to explain that to them, which I think the other candidates [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=122.58s)]
*  are not. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=126.02s)]
*  And I am because, you know what, if the government can decide what speech can and cannot be expressed, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=127.28s)]
*  there's no point in going through the rest of the motions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=132.74s)]
*  We're done as a country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  The United States of America might be a mass of land, but the identity of the nation is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=135.94s)]
*  gone. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=139.66s)]
*  Because the government or the party in power can use force, directly or indirectly, to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=140.74s)]
*  silence its political opponents. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  And I also worry, Glenn, that that's also the path that leads us, dare I say it, to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=148.02s)]
*  violence, actually. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you tell people they can't speak, that's when they scream. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  If you tell people they can't scream, that's when they tear things down. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  And so history teaches us this is not a road we want to go down. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=161.02s)]
*  People will ask now in the wake of a lot of the anti-Semitism, which I think is wrong [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=164.74s)]
*  in the United States, and I've condemned it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  What do you do then? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=170.34s)]
*  And how do you draw the line between free speech and this kind of speech that borders [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=171.34s)]
*  on inciting violence? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=175.34s)]
*  Here's the answer. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  If you are expressing an opinion, no matter how heinous that opinion, it's protected. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=178.7s)]
*  So telling somebody, hey, go down the street and stab that individual, that's not protected [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=185.08s)]
*  speech. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=188.74s)]
*  That's directly inciting violence in a clear and present sense of that word. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=189.74s)]
*  That's not the expression of an opinion. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=193.7s)]
*  If I sell you, I don't know, a bottle of water, but it contains poison inside of it, but I [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  say, hey, it's just a bottle of water. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=199.34s)]
*  That's not protected speech. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=201.18s)]
*  That's commercial speech. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=202.54s)]
*  It's not expressing an opinion. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=203.54s)]
*  But if you're expressing a true opinion, no matter how heinous that opinion, that is free [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  to go in the United States of America. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=210.02s)]
*  That's what the First Amendment protects. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=212.18s)]
*  And that's what I'm going to protect. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=213.18s)]
*  Give me liberty or give me death. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=215.18s)]
*  I mean that literally. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=216.18s)]
*  I will protect this one to the very end. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=217.18s)]
*  And I could lose some election. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=219.3s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=220.9s)]
*  I will stand for our right to express our opinions. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=221.9s)]
*  My sense is that could be a winning political strategy, Glenn, but that's not what's guiding [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  me to say it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=228.26s)]
*  When I asked you what role will it play in the primary, I didn't really mean to imply [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=230.17999999999998s)]
*  that this was an opportunistic strategy because I know it's not for you since you've been [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=234.34s)]
*  saying it for a lot longer before, since before you were in presidential candidate. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  What I meant was one of the things that distinguishes your campaign is that you spend most of your [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  time talking to voters, including going to a lot of places most Republican politicians [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=246.14s)]
*  don't as opposed to in back rooms raising money from GOP big donors. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=250.14s)]
*  In the process of doing that, have you heard from voters, from people that this is a concern [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=256.26s)]
*  of theirs, that they seem to be losing their core liberty because of the censorship regime [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=261.5s)]
*  imposed on the Internet? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=265.34s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you a mix, actually. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=266.34s)]
*  So there's a selection bias, certainly of people who come to my events, which include [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  a lot of free speech advocates, many of whom have not been traditional Republican partisans, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=273.46s)]
*  by the way, or people who have voted in the Iowa caucus. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=278.5s)]
*  We're bringing in new people, which as a side note, Glenn, if we get them actually to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=281.18s)]
*  come on January 15th, I think we're going to shatter the expectations and the polls [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=284.82s)]
*  because these people aren't polled. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=288.94s)]
*  But put that to one side, I'll be honest with you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=290.82s)]
*  What I see with the traditional Republican base right now is they're looking for leadership [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  on this issue. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  Many of them do see pro-Hamas college students or people marching on the bridge of Manhattan [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=298.94s)]
*  Bridge or Brooklyn Bridge in New York and wondering, hey, what the heck is going on? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=304.58s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=309.02s)]
*  And many of them, when Ron DeSantis says he wants to disband Students for Justice in Palestine [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=310.38s)]
*  on campuses or Nikki Haley saying similar things, kind of come around to being like, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=314.58s)]
*  OK, well, yeah, we need to go after these bad guys. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=320.02s)]
*  And I think it's going to take a leader to be able to say, hey, what they're saying is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=323.46s)]
*  heinous. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=327.62s)]
*  I will call that out. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=328.62s)]
*  It's offensive. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=329.62s)]
*  It offends the conscience in many cases. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=330.62s)]
*  But it's an opinion. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=333.18s)]
*  And if you say that now that you want the government being able to silence them, let [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=334.18s)]
*  me explain to you what that means. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  If you question a vaccine, that means you're going to be a bioterrorist. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=339.74s)]
*  If you label a student who tweets supporting terrorism, which is effectively what DeSantis [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=343.28s)]
*  is doing, then that means that if you're tweeting questioning the efficacy of a vaccine, they're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  going to label you a bioterrorist. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=352.67999999999995s)]
*  Or if you question what's being taught in a school, you're going to be called a domestic [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  terrorist that's happening in school. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  Parents who attend school board meetings already. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  Or if you say that someone who protested at the Capitol peacefully on January 6th and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=361.76s)]
*  you say they shouldn't be locked up, maybe you're an insurrectionist, then it really [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  I think with the voter base and says, OK, no, no, no, I don't want that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=371.2s)]
*  Actually, I know that you told me that that speech was bad. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=373.2s)]
*  But now that you explained it to me, I get that it's bad. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=376.36s)]
*  But it shouldn't be censored. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  We do live in a moment, Glenn, where people need to be led. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=381.0s)]
*  And I think part of what goes on in partisan politics today is you have a lot of poll testing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  going on. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=389.28s)]
*  People test something in the polls. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=390.28s)]
*  If it's going to go well, they're just going to spout that back out to the people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=391.28s)]
*  There's an old Thomas Sowell expression, which goes, if you care about somebody, you tell [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  them the truth. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  If you care about yourself, you tell them what they want to hear. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  I think you have a lot of politicians now doing the polling on this in the Republican [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=402.88s)]
*  primary and giving them what they want to hear. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=406.16s)]
*  In my candidacy, one of the things that you've seen is at the time that I adopted many of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=409.44s)]
*  my positions, they weren't necessarily popular at that time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=413.44s)]
*  Some of them have come around to becoming the mainstream Republican political view. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=417.36s)]
*  And so my hope is this defense of free speech that I'm offering in this primary will age [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=421.24s)]
*  well. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=425.48s)]
*  And it's not necessarily where many traditional GOP primary voters are right now. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=426.56s)]
*  Once I explain it to them, they are. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=433.08s)]
*  But that requires me reaching a lot of people to do it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=434.76s)]
*  That's the honest answer. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=436.76s)]
*  So in several other times that we've spoken, we've talked about both the Ukraine and U.S. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=438.04s)]
*  policy toward Israel. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=442.76s)]
*  So I don't want to spend a lot of time on that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=443.76s)]
*  I only ask you one on one. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=444.76s)]
*  I only want to ask one question about that because I have several other things I want [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=445.76s)]
*  to ask you about. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=449.68s)]
*  But I do want to ask you this because you have made some of the most pro-Israel statements [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=450.68s)]
*  in terms of Israel's right to react to the October 7th massacre in the ways that it decides [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=454.44s)]
*  it wants to do. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=461.52s)]
*  But there's a separate question of whether the U.S. should be financing Israel's war, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=462.76s)]
*  should be transferring billions of dollars in money. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=466.68s)]
*  Joe Biden just asked for another 14 billion dollars to give to Israel. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=469.48s)]
*  When we talked about Ukraine in the past, you said, look, we have too many problems [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=473.68s)]
*  at home. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  We can't afford to be financing a bunch of wars, including foreign nations wars. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  Does that rationale apply to Biden's request for 14 billion dollars? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=482.68s)]
*  And it'll be a lot more when all is said and done to Israel? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=486.48s)]
*  Or is there something different about Israel that makes that rationale inapplicable? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=489.16s)]
*  I'm against that funding request. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=494.04s)]
*  And I have been clear about this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=495.56s)]
*  The 61 billion to Ukraine, the 14 to 16, depending on the spending request for this specific [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=497.64s)]
*  war in Israel, I've made the case actually, Glenn, that I don't think that's in the U.S. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=502.56s)]
*  interest. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=506.44s)]
*  And I don't think it's in Israel's interest. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=507.44s)]
*  But either way, my rule of thumb across the board is any new elective foreign aid, we [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=509.0s)]
*  shouldn't be giving it as a country to anybody whose national debt per capita per person [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=514.8s)]
*  is less than the United States. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=520.28s)]
*  Now, I also go further and say that this is also consistent with Israel's own founding [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=521.68s)]
*  vision. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=527.16s)]
*  David Ben-Gurion, the founder of Israel, famously said, effectively in his own way, we don't [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=528.16s)]
*  want to depend on the fleeting sympathies of America or the U.N. or the West or anybody [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=533.48s)]
*  else. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=537.36s)]
*  Israel has an absolute right to its own national self-defense. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=538.36s)]
*  And I stand by that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=542.2s)]
*  But I stand by that by saying that we're best off and I believe Israel's best off when we're [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=543.2s)]
*  not intervening, when we're not armchair quarterbacking what they do. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=547.48s)]
*  We muddy the waters with U.S. involvement in this specific war. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=550.9s)]
*  So that's where I land on that is I think it's better for the U.S. and better for Israel. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=555.36s)]
*  And I should say there are a lot of very vehement pro-Israel supporters in the United States, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=559.08s)]
*  including several who have been on our show, who have called for an end to USAID to Israel [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=563.08s)]
*  precisely because they believe it hamstrings Israel, it places limits on what they can [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=571.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=572.4s)]
*  Let's move to something else, which is the newly elected Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=573.4s)]
*  made good on one of his promises that he made when elected, which was to release all videos [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=578.36s)]
*  the January 6th riot that happened at the Capitol in 2021. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=583.96s)]
*  It is shocking, I think, that it took two years for the public to see all videos as [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=587.12s)]
*  opposed to the videos handpicked for us by Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=591.84s)]
*  But now we finally have them. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=596.84s)]
*  There have been a lot of videos that we've covered on our show that I think are very [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  illuminating. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=600.84s)]
*  What do you make of these new videos and what is your view now on January 6th? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=601.84s)]
*  Looking back, look, it shocks the conscience. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  The fact that you have police escorting people in, that's a form of entrapment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  I would say somebody escorting you in as though they're actually rolling out the red carpet [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=615.24s)]
*  for you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=620.16s)]
*  Some of those videos and then some of those same people have been prosecuted as domestic [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=621.16s)]
*  terrorists effectively in the treatment the court system has given them. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=624.96s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=628.68s)]
*  That's not the United States of America. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=629.68s)]
*  And Glenn, for me, this is a part of a continuing and deeply concerning pattern, frankly, over [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=630.68s)]
*  the last 20 years of the national security establishment, Republicans and Democrats alike. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  In many cases, Republicans more than Democrats exploiting those laws to completely disrespect [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=642.0s)]
*  the constitutional rights of individuals. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=648.48s)]
*  I mean, the same government, and this is a long past, but the same government that we [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=650.0400000000001s)]
*  know lied to us in the aftermath of even something terrible that happened to this country. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  Horrific. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=659.5600000000001s)]
*  In the wake of 9-11, they said that, oh, Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  And then now we know that Omar al-Bayoumi, the 42-year-old graduate student who welcomed [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=664.12s)]
*  people in LAX Airport, absolutely was a Saudi intelligence operative. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  Our own government declassified that 20 years later. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  So it's this bad habit where they use the act to effectuate an agenda that otherwise [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=676.1s)]
*  should shock the constitutional conscience. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=681.74s)]
*  But then when the fervor has died down, quietly release what the actual facts are to say that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=684.4200000000001s)]
*  they were transparent, the people deserve the truth, the whole truth, not just when [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=689.1800000000001s)]
*  it's easy, but when it's hard. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=693.74s)]
*  And the fact that this took two years to come out, I think, explains a lot of why they suppressed [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=696.3000000000001s)]
*  this video footage. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=701.98s)]
*  There's stuff in there that I'm sure the government did not want us to see when the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=702.98s)]
*  Biden administration led a post-9-11-like, patriot act-like scourge of Americans across [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=706.38s)]
*  this country, concerned Americans. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=712.46s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=714.72s)]
*  The wave of domestic terrorism, calling white nationalism the greatest threat that we face [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=715.72s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=718.88s)]
*  And then really, I would say, offending the Constitution at various steps of the way to [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=719.88s)]
*  go after people who have not been granted their constitutional rights to due process [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=724.6s)]
*  in many of those prosecutions or those plea deals that have been extracted. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=728.66s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=732.5s)]
*  So, one of the things I've said is a president rarely gets an opportunity to go back and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=733.5s)]
*  change the past. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  You can only change the future. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  But one way a president can do it is through the pardon power. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=740.42s)]
*  And so I have a list of day one pardons I'm committed to, Glenn. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=743.02s)]
*  Anybody who was a peaceful protester on January 6th, day one pardon. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=746.8399999999999s)]
*  Anybody who had their due process rights denied, including Brady rule violations or otherwise, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=750.9399999999999s)]
*  day one pardon. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=756.3399999999999s)]
*  And I put others on this list, too. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=757.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, put Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, not quite a pardon, but a form of clemency. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=758.9s)]
*  I would say the same because he wasn't prosecuted. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=763.18s)]
*  But the same idea to Russ Albrecht, to be able to go to Donald Trump, even somebody [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=765.1s)]
*  who was, I believe, now the victim of politically motivated persecutions through prosecution. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=769.28s)]
*  It's interesting that I am the only Republican candidate in this field that's actually been [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=775.34s)]
*  able to say these things, certainly on that debate stage. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=780.22s)]
*  And the question, again, that that begs is why, Glenn? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=783.34s)]
*  And it's because the puppet masters in the Republican Party establishment do not approve [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=786.9s)]
*  of this message. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=791.4599999999999s)]
*  Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman, failed chairwoman, I should say, of the RNC for her failed track [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=792.4599999999999s)]
*  record over the last five years. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=797.42s)]
*  After that last debate, that third debate, which I don't know if you saw that or not, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=799.54s)]
*  but that was somebody who said, I would not get another cent of funding from the RNC, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=803.64s)]
*  almost proving my point about that corruption. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=809.34s)]
*  The thing, and it's sad, the sad reality is the only reason I'm able to do this is because [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=812.14s)]
*  I can self-finance this campaign with 150,000 some odd small dollar donors that are lifting [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=815.7s)]
*  this up. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=821.1s)]
*  But it takes a guy who has lived the American dream, achieved financial success at pretty [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=822.1s)]
*  much the highest level to be able to declare independence from that establishment. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=825.98s)]
*  That's not how the system is supposed to work, but it's the reality of the system as it exists [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=830.6s)]
*  today. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=834.26s)]
*  And so, yeah, a lot of what I'm saying, I'm the only candidate saying it because the Republican [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=835.3000000000001s)]
*  establishment doesn't approve of it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=838.34s)]
*  But that gives me a special sense of purpose to double down and keep doing it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVswjkjfHw&t=840.1800000000001s)]
