# Why Russia Expelled USAID Long Ago: With Russian Analyst Aleksandr Dugin
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4)
*  Let me ask you, though. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=0.0s)]
*  You referenced USAID and then sort of with USAID as the National Endowment for Democracy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  And it's gotten a lot of attention in the United States in the last two or three weeks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=16.88s)]
*  because the new government has been targeting it with budget cuts and there's a lot of discussion [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=20.36s)]
*  about what are these agencies and what do they do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  There's sort of an attempt to say, oh, these are charitable agencies. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=27.520000000000003s)]
*  They go around the world helping people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=30.32s)]
*  They give to the poor. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=32.08s)]
*  And maybe there is an extent to which they do that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=33.08s)]
*  But in a lot of countries, there's a lot of hostility towards these agencies because of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=36.6s)]
*  the perception and the proof that they're used by the US government to interfere in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=39.84s)]
*  other countries. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  That's something that from the Russian perspective is understood or seen about the National Endowment [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=47.72s)]
*  for Democracy, about USAID, that they're armed to interfere in not just other countries, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=52.32s)]
*  but specifically here in Russia. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=57.32s)]
*  As well as network of Soros and all the other assets linked to USAID, USAID. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=59.36s)]
*  We have found a long time ago that there is something wrong with USAID as the agency. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=68.8s)]
*  Because instead of promotion, some humanitarian help and aid to the people, to the society, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=80.12s)]
*  they are just the instrument to organize color revolutions, to influence media. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  They were buying independent so-called independent journalists and bloggers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=99.72s)]
*  Inside Russia? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=107.48s)]
*  Outside of Russia in the post-Soviet space? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=108.68s)]
*  We have remarked that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=113.28s)]
*  We have fixed that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=115.0s)]
*  And after 2012, USAID was prohibited here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=116.44s)]
*  Not because they gave humanitarian aid, because they worked to destabilize political situations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  They intervened in social process trying to help and to promote the regime change. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=138.4s)]
*  That was nothing like humanitarian agency. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=146.0s)]
*  That was a kind of soft power, sometimes including terrorist network, used by globalists, not [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  by government of United States, in order to promote some ideological agenda. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=161.8s)]
*  Fighting against what they called authoritarian regimes in order to install at their place [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=168.72s)]
*  so-called liberal democracies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  So that was ideologically engaged and very radical and illegal system. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  That was for us as well a very astonishing, very amazing step of Trump's administration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=191.2s)]
*  The first week they have dismantled it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=201.44s)]
*  The first week in the White House, they started with that, with revealing the truth that USAID [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=204.8s)]
*  was some ideological assets and not just normal government agencies. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  So we knew that long before. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=225.32s)]
*  And that was very important step, because I think many things will be changed now when [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=228.0s)]
*  there is no such huge support of ideological war that globalists waged on all humanity [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  and especially in our country, only Ukraine. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=248.8s)]
*  Because it seems now that 90% of so-called free press, free media in Ukraine was supported [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=252.56s)]
*  financially by USAID. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=263.88s)]
*  So that is something that was clear and transparent for us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=266.52s)]
*  And that Trump has come to see. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNIOEgcSWZ4&t=274.44s)]
