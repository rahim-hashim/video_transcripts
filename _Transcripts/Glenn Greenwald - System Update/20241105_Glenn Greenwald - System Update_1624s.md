# Briahna Joy Gray: Dems Are Pitching To Donors, Not Voters
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8)
*  Okay, so Brianna, I wanted to talk to you for a while because obviously we're on, as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=0.0s)]
*  you may be aware, the eve of the 2024 election. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=13.42s)]
*  There could be some people out there who are still making up their minds. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  I would doubt that there are that many watching system update on Rumble who are undecided, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=21.44s)]
*  but you never know. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=26.12s)]
*  Something that I've noted, having gone around and surveyed undecided voters here in Pennsylvania, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=27.8s)]
*  which is ground zero for an endless bombardment of propaganda, it's actually incredible. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=31.84s)]
*  I know this happens every election cycle to some extent, especially post-Citizens United, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=38.44s)]
*  which basically eliminated all constraints on political spending, but it really is incredible [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=42.68s)]
*  to see just how inundated Pennsylvanians are. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=50.72s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of Pennsylvania voters who are undecided partially because they're [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=53.56s)]
*  so alienated from all the endless propaganda that they're being bombarded with that they [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  kind of just are contemplating potentially not even voting out of spite, and I sympathize [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=66.64s)]
*  with that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  So did you get a chance to look at any of the articles that I sent you on this kind [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=73.84s)]
*  of I'm trying to basically postulate a certain type of undecided voter who exists out there [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=82.32s)]
*  in the universe who I think is under examined, and it's not somebody who's making a last [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=88.36s)]
*  minute impulsive decision between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  Most people who are determined to vote already have would make up their minds. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  Those aren't the quintessential undecided voter. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=103.08s)]
*  The undecided voter that I most encounter here in Pennsylvania and also around the country [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  are people who are disenchanted with the electoral process, and they may have a mild [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=110.16s)]
*  preference one or the other. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=117.0s)]
*  Interestingly enough, they tend to express more of a preference for Trump in my experience, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  but they might not be motivated to actually go and bother and vote because they don't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=124.52s)]
*  think it particularly matters. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=128.92s)]
*  So that doesn't surprise me at all. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we do this every election cycle, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=134.8s)]
*  What is the stat about there being more nonvoters than Americans who identify with either political [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=137.04s)]
*  party, record high numbers of people who identify as independents, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  And that is largely because people, once you get to a certain age, it only takes a few [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=147.2s)]
*  election cycles to start to get the sense that no matter who's sitting in the Oval Office, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=150.72s)]
*  your life is substantively the same. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=154.84s)]
*  Now, I'm not going to sit here and say that there aren't meaningful differences that come [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  around on a generational basis, that there are meaningful differences in terms of the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  labor conditions that people have to organize under or, let's say, Roe being overturned. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=163.92s)]
*  But realistically speaking, practically speaking for most people's lives, the consequences [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=169.4s)]
*  of organizing under Biden's Labor Department being better, it is meaningful at the same [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=175.48s)]
*  time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=183.6s)]
*  Fewer than 10% of Americans are in unions, and those numbers have not meaningfully dropped [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=184.6s)]
*  despite the fact that we have a more pro-labor president in office. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=188.68s)]
*  And again, that is not to say to diminish those gains, but the fact is when you have [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=193.36s)]
*  wins that touch the lives, directly touch the lives of so few Americans, you find yourself [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=198.36s)]
*  facing a lot of disaffected voters. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=204.56s)]
*  Now, there are policies that have the potential to touch a lot of people in one fell swoop. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  Remember, Biden's announced student debt policy was going to affect 44 million Americans, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=212.0s)]
*  44 million Americans who are going to get $10,000 to $20,000 of their student debt [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  canceled. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=222.32s)]
*  Remember that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=223.32s)]
*  Remember how impactful the $1,200 checks were back in the early days of COVID. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=224.32s)]
*  There are voters today still, I'm sure you encountered some of them, who will evoke those [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  checks as long ago as they were as some of the most meaningful interventions from the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=236.0s)]
*  government they've ever experienced in their life. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=240.88s)]
*  And yet, Democrats have a tendency to, I would argue, purposefully avoid, but even if you're [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=243.28s)]
*  giving them the benefit of the doubt, set up their agenda, their policy agendas that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=249.92s)]
*  strive more for small incrementalism instead of the sweeping programs that I think could [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=254.88s)]
*  really win devoted, committed members of the base for many, many cycles going forward. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=259.84s)]
*  And then there's the last point on that that's Pennsylvania specific. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  It's notable that fracking and Kamala Harris's flip-flopping on a fracking ban has been such [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=269.64s)]
*  a point of contention. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=276.3s)]
*  She's seemingly willing to completely revise her 2019-2020 stance. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=279.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=283.4s)]
*  Well, there's only about 17,000 fracking jobs in the entire state of Pennsylvania. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=284.4s)]
*  In fact, a majority of Pennsylvania voters are supportive of the fracking ban and are [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=288.44s)]
*  deeply concerned about the health implications of having to drink this luminous light on [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=291.96s)]
*  fire water that fracking creates. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  On the other hand, had she wanted to touch, again, tens of thousands of Pennsylvania voters, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  she could have focused on the fact that Pennsylvania voters are still operating under a federal [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  minimum wage. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=308.92s)]
*  That's the federal minimum wage that hasn't been raised since 2009, the longest period [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=309.92s)]
*  in American history since we've had a minimum wage. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=315.76s)]
*  And even though there's tens of thousands of minimum wage workers in Pennsylvania that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=317.76s)]
*  are still on the federal minimum wage rate, you barely hear a peep out of the Democratic [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=321.92s)]
*  Party about a $15 minimum wage, which isn't some far-fetched lefty agenda item. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=325.88s)]
*  It's a core base item on the Democratic agenda. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=330.44s)]
*  So what is really going on here? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=333.48s)]
*  It feels like there's many voters who are increasingly disaffected because the Democratic [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  Party is pitching their pitch to their donor base who care about things like a fracking [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=337.92s)]
*  ban, the energy company, the defense contractors and the like, instead of actually talking [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=342.88s)]
*  to the voters whose votes they need. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=347.36s)]
*  And look at who Kamala Harris is clearly tailoring her message to in the final weeks of that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  campaign. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=357.76s)]
*  It's still bizarre to me to even utter this out loud, but it really is centered on Liz [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=359.04s)]
*  Cheney and disaffected, highly engaged, news attentive Republicans who Kamala Harris apparently [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=364.72s)]
*  wagers that she'll be able to convince to come and vote for the Democrat. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=374.56s)]
*  I don't know for sure that that is an impossibly crazy strategy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=380.8s)]
*  It certainly didn't work in 2016 for Hillary Clinton when she employed a version of it, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=388.0s)]
*  but you could argue perhaps that it might have worked to some extent for Biden in 2020. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=391.92s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=396.48s)]
*  I mean, Biden did largely win in the consistent states because of major shifts within affluent [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  suburbs, whereas the city centers like in Philadelphia or in Detroit or Milwaukee actually [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  trended marginally toward Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=410.72s)]
*  But that was offset by the major gains that the Democrats made in these affluent suburbs, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=412.72s)]
*  which are increasingly at the forefront of their electoral coalition. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=417.6s)]
*  There's been a ton of energy expended on this show and other shows in the so-called alternative [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  media ecosystem, dismantling the Democrats. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=430.72s)]
*  And I'm always all for that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=434.32000000000005s)]
*  I can never get enough of it, and I support it on principle. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  But I do want to talk about Donald Trump because one thing that's so maddening to me about this [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=440.8s)]
*  election cycle, and I spelled it out in the other article that I wrote about my non-vote [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  in the 2024 election, is that I consider myself to some extent a part of alternative media. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=452.23999999999995s)]
*  I think it's a necessary corrective and has been a necessary corrective to the propagation of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  mainstream narratives and opening opportunities for people who might not have a traditional route [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=464.0s)]
*  to conduct journalism or engage in the media. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry to say, and people are going to get angry at me for saying this who are watching, but [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=474.72s)]
*  a lot of alternative media this cycle has basically just been converted into a Republican [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=479.44s)]
*  cheerleading squad. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=485.44s)]
*  Donald Trump can handpick whatever podcaster, bro, guy, and I don't even say that derogatorily, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=487.68s)]
*  I watch some of these podcasts, who he can go and banter with for an hour and a half, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=493.04s)]
*  and they'll want to ask him a single challenging question. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=498.0s)]
*  And the list goes on. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there are people who I would have had a much more respectable opinion of like a year or [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  two ago, who decided that their proper role in the 2024 election was basically just to join [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  the Trump bandwagon. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=516.0s)]
*  And if you want to vote for Trump, OK, fine, but let's actually do some serious critique [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  of his record, of his policy positions, and it's just been virtually missing in these alternative [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  media spheres, as far as I could tell. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=527.28s)]
*  I don't know if you watched any of my introduction, but I happened to be at one of the final Trump [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  rallies today in Reading, Pennsylvania. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  He pointed to Mike Pompeo, who was there in the Trump entourage, out on the campaign trail with [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  Trump today, said what a great guy he is. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=542.56s)]
*  He said on multiple occasions that Mike Pompeo was one of the people that is in consideration [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=545.52s)]
*  for another senior level administration position. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=550.8s)]
*  And for all we want to bemoan the Democrats relying on Dick and Liz Cheney, what's the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=553.6s)]
*  substantive difference really between Trump parading around with Mike Pompeo? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=561.68s)]
*  Tom Cotton was also there, one of the most virulent hawks in the entire Senate. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=566.88s)]
*  Marco Rubio was in the entourage today. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=571.76s)]
*  I mean, Lindsey Graham is a top surrogate. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=573.92s)]
*  None of these people have been cast out of the so-called RFK Jr. reformed [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=576.64s)]
*  MAGA Republican Party or a MAHA party. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=580.88s)]
*  And I just think that there's such a torrent of confusion around this and a lack of serious [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=583.76s)]
*  critical examination that I sort of sometimes worry that the overwhelming focus that I have [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  often partook in in criticizing and scrutinizing the Democrats has given way to the Trump and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=594.96s)]
*  the Republicans, at least in these alternative media circles, kind of being given a free pass. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=601.6s)]
*  And there's just a flood of propaganda being repeated that is flattering to them without [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=606.88s)]
*  actually examining the record or what they would do a second time. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  So am I crazy here? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=615.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're not crazy, Michael. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=618.24s)]
*  And I want to say you've demonstrated an enormous amount of integrity in being willing to be [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=619.44s)]
*  consistent about this and call out both sides. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, look, I'm more of a member of the left side of the independent media sphere. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  So I don't think there's really any as much of a lack of criticism of Trump over there, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=632.0s)]
*  particularly people who are more center left on this side of what we call the establishment [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=638.32s)]
*  left on this side of the aisle spins. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=643.44s)]
*  I would argue even too much time criticizing Trump. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=644.8s)]
*  But I do think kind of the more independent center or independent right media sphere does [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=647.68s)]
*  sometimes fall prey to a sort of fallacy that many of us fall prey to in politics, which is [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=653.6s)]
*  as a result of us living in a two party system, sometimes the criticism of the other, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=663.84s)]
*  the criticism of the party that is farther away from where your interests lie ends up [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=670.08s)]
*  defaulting into praise for your own side. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  And there is a presumption that criticism of one team means that the other team is better [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=678.48s)]
*  and therefore good. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=684.16s)]
*  And I think that's part of what's going on here. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=685.6s)]
*  I think there are really legitimate critiques to be made about the Democratic Party and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=687.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris's choice to bear hug every neocon within reach. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=691.2s)]
*  You have Twitter campaigns to recruit George W. Bush to endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=695.76s)]
*  I mean, it's really dystopian stuff. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=701.36s)]
*  But you're getting a similar kind of blindness, a myopia about what's going on on the right in terms [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  of Trump's embrace of neoconservatives. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you said earlier that in your experience doing these man on the street interviews, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=713.84s)]
*  you sometimes find these disaffected voters lean right, lean toward Donald Trump. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=717.36s)]
*  And that doesn't surprise me at all in part because I think the instinct for people when [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=721.36s)]
*  they are disaffected is to throw a monkey wrench into the machinery and vote for the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=725.36s)]
*  least established candidate. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=730.08s)]
*  Now, you'd be hard pressed to call Donald Trump not an establishment person. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=731.6s)]
*  He was literally a president of United States of America. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=736.16s)]
*  And because it's 2024, not 2016, we know what happens when he's president. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=738.8s)]
*  We know that he does not, in fact, drain the swamp. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=743.68s)]
*  He fills it with the same creatures that have been inhabiting it since time immemorial. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=746.16s)]
*  He is not, in fact, an anti-war, pro-peace, isolationist, whatever you want to call it, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=749.76s)]
*  sort of a candidate. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=755.36s)]
*  But he has benefiting from the fact that Kamala Harris is a member of the current administration [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  that is litigating two wars, two wars that didn't exist when Donald Trump was in office. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=760.48s)]
*  I think the curative to this in some ways is actually growing, establishing, focusing, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=764.16s)]
*  and highlighting alternative parties, whether it's someone like Chase Oliver, the libertarian [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=769.28s)]
*  candidate who is, in fact, an anti-war candidate who opposes the interventions in Ukraine [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=773.36s)]
*  and Israel, or someone like Jill Stein, Claudia de la Cruz, or Kendall West on the left side of [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=779.04s)]
*  the aisle who are staunchly anti-war candidates. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=784.08s)]
*  At the end of the day, when you don't have a resting place, a landing pad for people's [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=788.64s)]
*  ideologies to come to, it's very, very easy to exploit their political opposition to one [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  camp as fidelity to another. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=802.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And let me give you an example of something that I've found also maddening. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=806.48s)]
*  This kind of typifies some of my frustration with this. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=813.04s)]
*  So in the final week, Donald Trump and his campaign operation, I think, have wisely identified [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=816.64s)]
*  that a useful foil for them politically will be Liz Janie and Dick Janie, right? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=824.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to Michigan and having imams appear on stage with him and suggesting [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=832.08s)]
*  that he would be preferable for their interests because he stands opposed to the vicious [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=839.5200000000001s)]
*  war monger that is Liz Janie. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=846.08s)]
*  Well, for one thing, I don't know why so few people have bothered to do this. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=848.24s)]
*  Like, I'm not trying to make myself out to be a martyr, but I really don't know of anybody [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=853.36s)]
*  else who's done it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  Just go back into the record when Trump was actually in power as president the first time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=858.0s)]
*  Liz Janie was one of his most stalwart defenders. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=863.6s)]
*  You know, back when Trump drone struck assassinated Soleimani, the first out the gate, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  the top Iranian general, first out the gate cheering for that was Liz Janie. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, who was running for president in the Democratic primaries at the time, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  was one of the first to denounce that and accuse Trump of betraying any voter who thought they [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=883.28s)]
*  might have been voting for him on anti-war grounds and said that Trump was basically [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=889.9200000000001s)]
*  just like the rest of them. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=894.96s)]
*  Of course, that's now shifted with no explanation. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=895.84s)]
*  Everything just gets flushed down the memory hole because everybody has a memory of a fruit [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=898.4s)]
*  fly. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=902.08s)]
*  But I don't know, I guess I follow this stuff too closely to have my brain zapped in that [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=902.72s)]
*  fashion. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=907.6s)]
*  I like remember stuff that happened a couple of years ago, and that makes me very unusual. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=908.08s)]
*  But here's what exemplifies my frustration. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=913.84s)]
*  OK, so Trump elevates Liz Janie as the foil as a reaction to Kamala Harris elevating Liz [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=916.32s)]
*  Janie as an ally. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=922.1600000000001s)]
*  But Donald Trump, and nobody's covered this, has recently taken to saying that he was never [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=924.08s)]
*  going to withdraw from Afghanistan. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=929.6s)]
*  OK, one of the few policy fissures that Trump and Liz Janie did have when Trump was president [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=932.48s)]
*  was that Liz Janie tried to legislatively impede Trump's ability to execute a withdrawal [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  from Afghanistan because Trump, at least, nominally claimed that that was his intent [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  toward the end of his term. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=949.28s)]
*  He first escalated in Afghanistan. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=950.32s)]
*  People forget this. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=951.76s)]
*  The largest, he dropped a record number of munitions in Afghanistan in the years 2018 [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=953.6s)]
*  and 2019. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=959.36s)]
*  And he also escalated the troop deployments in Afghanistan in 2017 by several thousand. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=961.84s)]
*  So again, all flushed down the memory hole. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=967.36s)]
*  But then toward the end of his first term, he did claim that he wanted to withdraw. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=969.28s)]
*  And Liz Janie, with the help of Democrats in Congress, as usual, sought to stymie that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=973.68s)]
*  But now, in 2020, and Trump never actually fulfilled the withdrawal that he claimed that [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=978.8s)]
*  he wanted to do. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=986.8s)]
*  Biden ultimately did. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=987.52s)]
*  So then as a partisan or polarized reaction to the Biden withdrawal, what Trump has done [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=989.76s)]
*  is debuted a brand new position in the 2024 campaign, which is that he was never going [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=995.52s)]
*  to withdraw at all. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1000.3199999999999s)]
*  It was actually all a facade. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1001.12s)]
*  The Doha agreement that he brokered, along with Mike Pompeo, with the Taliban in February [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1003.1999999999999s)]
*  of 2020, called for the withdrawal of all US troops from all US bases in Afghanistan. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1008.0s)]
*  That was the crux of what the withdrawal was supposed to consist of. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1013.6s)]
*  But Trump says he was actually going to maintain a permanent occupation force in Afghanistan [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1017.04s)]
*  at Bagram Air Base with 4,000 or more troops and all the ancillary combat missions that [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1022.64s)]
*  that would have to entail to retain that base under the violent protest of the Taliban and [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1027.68s)]
*  other local groups, which obviously the reason that the war was raging for 20 years is because [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1033.2s)]
*  the Taliban and the other local indigenous groups wanted to violently expel the American [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1037.92s)]
*  force presence. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  But Trump says he would have kept that in perpetuity now. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1045.04s)]
*  And here's the irony, okay? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1047.6000000000001s)]
*  Trump has actually embraced the Liz Cheney policy position while also being allowed to [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1050.0s)]
*  conduct this Kabuki theater or WWF style feud with Liz Cheney that basically just derives [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  from Liz Cheney becoming a January 6 obsessive, voting to impeach Trump the second time. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1066.88s)]
*  She defended him on the first and then getting basically thrown out of Congress because she [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1072.16s)]
*  lost in the Republican primaries. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1079.0400000000002s)]
*  There's no policy content to this. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1080.48s)]
*  If there is, somebody should explain it to me because as of 2019-20, Trump was more than [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  happy to say that he and Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney were all perfectly good pals. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1088.72s)]
*  So where was the ideological distinction then? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1093.7600000000002s)]
*  So I just wish there would be somebody out there who would point this stuff out, but [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1096.24s)]
*  nobody does. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1099.44s)]
*  And again, sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1100.48s)]
*  You're not going crazy. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1102.88s)]
*  And again, I applaud you and your research consistency, your ideological consistency, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1105.28s)]
*  all of it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  Look, you mentioned earlier that you see this as in some ways a, this problem festering in [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1111.52s)]
*  or being a product of the alternative media sphere. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1118.16s)]
*  But I do wonder to what degree you place some significant responsibility on the mainstream [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1120.4s)]
*  conservative news outlets who I think have really abdicated the responsibility to have any sort of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1128.0800000000002s)]
*  adversarial interview with Donald Trump. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1134.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, if we're going to hold Theo Vaughn to some standard or Joe Rogan to some standard of [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1136.4s)]
*  journalistic integrity when they really are just podcasters at the end of the day with no real [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1143.76s)]
*  obligation here, what do we say to all of the legitimate journalists on Fox News who actually [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1148.56s)]
*  have access to Donald Trump on a semi-regular basis, but choose not to press him on these [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1155.2s)]
*  inconsistencies? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1160.24s)]
*  What do we say to all of the Republicans in office, some of whom ran against Donald Trump [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1161.1200000000001s)]
*  in a Republican primary, who at the end of that primary season reverted from any effort to be [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1165.84s)]
*  critical of Donald Trump and have not tried to hold him responsible for these flip-flop [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1172.72s)]
*  views over time, views which have really serious implications as we are in the middle of multiple [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1179.04s)]
*  escalations across the world? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  I do hold them responsible. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1189.3600000000001s)]
*  I guess maybe I'm so inured to the sycophantic relationship that these conservative media organs [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1190.72s)]
*  have with Trump that it doesn't even occur to me to notice at this point. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1198.64s)]
*  But no, Trump does go on Fox News a lot and it's always the most ass-kissing possible interview. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1203.44s)]
*  I guess part of what draws me to highlight the role of the independent media is that it's [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  somewhat new and novel and therefore worth commenting on or analyzing. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1214.96s)]
*  I went to a Trump town hall, they call it, in Georgia a couple of weeks ago. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1220.64s)]
*  And I had done the same with Kamala Harris. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1226.8s)]
*  I tried to be fairly impartial and cover both candidates. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1228.8799999999999s)]
*  Again, a crazy idea to most people. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1231.52s)]
*  But Kamala Harris, I went to her Univision town hall in Las Vegas and I found out that the [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1234.0s)]
*  audience was basically stacked with supposedly undecided voters who turned out to be recruited [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1240.32s)]
*  by a casting company and they showed up, they told me, because they wanted to demonstrate [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1247.4399999999998s)]
*  their support for Harris. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1253.9199999999998s)]
*  So it totally flew in the face what the entire premise of this fake town hall was. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1254.88s)]
*  But then I went to a Trump town hall, hosted by Fox News, the following week in Georgia, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  sold as just consisting of generic women voters for Trump to talk about women's issues. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1266.24s)]
*  And it didn't take that much effort to go and chat with some of these ladies who were in the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1273.3600000000001s)]
*  all-women audience and they were recruited to come because Fox sent the attendance information [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1278.64s)]
*  to local Republican women's groups and it was just a Trump pep rally. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1284.24s)]
*  The Kamala Harris story that I did went viral on the internet. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1292.0s)]
*  Lots of people covered it, lots of aggregating sites picked it up. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1295.28s)]
*  The Trump story, it didn't. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1298.16s)]
*  So I don't know what to make of that necessarily. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1299.92s)]
*  Maybe people don't care or they have a rooting interest in Trump and therefore don't want to [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1302.56s)]
*  highlight anything that's unflattering of him. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1305.68s)]
*  But this is a constant theme that I note. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1307.92s)]
*  And yeah, it's true. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1311.44s)]
*  I do want to go ahead. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1313.44s)]
*  Well, I just quickly, I think what part of that might be is that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1315.2s)]
*  the there is a both the conservative or right leaning independent media and right leaning [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1319.92s)]
*  mainstream media are in lockstep and wanting to cover, I think, legitimate criticism of [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1326.08s)]
*  Kamala Harris in addition to illegitimate ones. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1333.04s)]
*  What's really funny about the left, I won't call them left, the liberal mainstream media [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1335.28s)]
*  is they seem to only want to cover Trump stories that are about decorum, criticizing [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1340.72s)]
*  him for saying something that seems outlandish, dancing awkwardly on stage, having orange [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1346.24s)]
*  makeup on, saying something that they can compare to Adolf Hitler, those sorts of things. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1352.08s)]
*  But they never ever focus on the kinds of criticisms that Trump's own base would actually [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1357.92s)]
*  care about, only sort of lib fetish stories. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1364.0s)]
*  So if Trump betrays his promises, if Trump is actually the hawkish one, if Trump is anti-worker, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1371.04s)]
*  if he genuinely betrays his base, if he declines to drain the swamp, if he is bought out by [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1382.0s)]
*  corporate interests, Democrats are interested in covering those stories in large part because [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1390.56s)]
*  they have similar issues in their own cohort with their own candidates, but also because [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1394.72s)]
*  they don't believe there's any legitimate reasons why any voter would actually like [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1401.12s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1405.9199999999998s)]
*  They think it's 100% about racism and bigotry and as a consequence, when there are those [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1406.72s)]
*  potential fissures that they could be exploiting to point out to Trump voters that he's not [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1412.0s)]
*  the guy that they think he is, they can't even see it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1415.6799999999998s)]
*  So I do think that's part of what's going on. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1418.64s)]
*  Yeah, and then the danger, the resulting danger is that for casual news consumers, like the [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1420.24s)]
*  people who would be in the Joe Rogan audience, for instance, who maybe just pick up snippets [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1429.6s)]
*  here and there, and again, I'm not even denigrating Joe Rogan at all. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1435.12s)]
*  I'm a long time Joe Rogan listener myself. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1439.04s)]
*  Yeah, but Joe Rogan isn't a journalist and I wouldn't expect him to perform a journalistic [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1443.28s)]
*  function when he's interviewing Trump and that's an indictment in a way of the larger [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1446.96s)]
*  media landscape, which has failed to perform its proper function and scrutinize both candidates [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1452.08s)]
*  properly. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1456.8s)]
*  But the average Joe Rogan listener, the only critiques they ever really hear of Trump are [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1457.2s)]
*  the shrieking liberal superficial facile critiques where they do often distort like a wisecrack [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1466.16s)]
*  that Trump makes or they do make these hyperbolic comparisons to Hitler and Nazi Germany. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1475.68s)]
*  He wants to assassinate Liz Cheney. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1483.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this nonsense or like he's, I'm sorry, like screaming racism over and over [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1486.64s)]
*  again has diminishing returns, especially if you have a proven track record of not [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1492.5600000000002s)]
*  accurately conveying what it is that Trump was actually saying or exaggerating or people tune out [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1499.92s)]
*  the histrionics about Trump. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1506.8s)]
*  So they're totally deprived of a reasoned rational critique of Trump, right? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1509.12s)]
*  So yes, that is largely the fault of the more mainstream corporate traditional media. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1515.68s)]
*  And so you never hear people cover stuff like, I don't know, Trump tried to do regime change [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1522.16s)]
*  in Venezuela. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1527.2s)]
*  Trump did create a state of war as Tulsi Gabbard herself said in January of 2020. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1528.64s)]
*  She's abandoned that critique at this point, but she accused Trump of initiating or instigating [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1532.96s)]
*  a state of war with Iran by launching a drone strike assassination of the top Iranian general. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1537.2s)]
*  And Trump to this day, Trump in this current campaign is going around saying, calling on [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1544.88s)]
*  Israel to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1550.4s)]
*  He's parading around with Mary Maddelson pouring $100 million into his campaign because she was so [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1553.8400000000001s)]
*  pleased with the return that her and her late husband Sheldon's investment got when Trump was [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1562.08s)]
*  first in power in terms of Israel policy. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1568.16s)]
*  And of course, she's fanatically quote pro-Israel. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1570.48s)]
*  And what is that foretell for a second Trump term? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1574.8s)]
*  Well, I would like, I would hope that more media would cover that, but they don't. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1577.76s)]
*  Instead, they get fixated on these trivialities and try to gin up bogus controversy. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1581.84s)]
*  Understand why the Joe Rogan typical audience member is not really interested in hearing [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1587.12s)]
*  Trump critiques because they think it's all BS. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1592.24s)]
*  Because they're not exposed to the real critique. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7F9rnJtDX8&t=1594.32s)]
