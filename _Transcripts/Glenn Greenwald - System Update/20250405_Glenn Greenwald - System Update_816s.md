# Prof. John Mearsheimer: Why Israel’s Destruction of Gaza is "A Genocide”
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U)
*  All right, we previewed the discussion that we're about to have with Professor John Mearsheimer, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=0.0s)]
*  so I just want to get right into that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=10.72s)]
*  Professor Mearsheimer, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=12.4s)]
*  It's always great to see you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=14.96s)]
*  Great to be here, Glenn. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  You know, I actually thought about this morning and this afternoon starting by talking to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  you about the free speech crisis and the kind of assaults on academic freedom taking place [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=23.56s)]
*  in America, academia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=28.36s)]
*  I mean, I of course want to get to that with you, but I realize afterwards it's almost [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=29.52s)]
*  impossible not to begin with the ongoing atrocities in Gaza because the scale of it, the horror [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=33.6s)]
*  of it, the fact that the United States is directly responsible for it, I think really [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=38.24s)]
*  requires that it be the first topic that we talk about. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=41.84s)]
*  So I guess my question is to you, and we've talked about before, what you think the Israeli [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  motives might be in essentially destroying all of Gaza, destroying civilian life in all [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=52.0s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=57.32s)]
*  It seems like there's no doubt any longer what their intentions are. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=58.32s)]
*  They're saying it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=60.8s)]
*  There's really only really one one possibility. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=61.8s)]
*  I'm just interested in your view of what that is. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=64.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think there is only one possible goal here, given what they're doing, and that is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=67.72s)]
*  to ethically cleanse Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=75.64s)]
*  And what they're trying to do is make Gaza unlivable. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=78.28s)]
*  And that in their story will force the Palestinians to leave. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=82.32s)]
*  But other than that, I can't see what possible motive they would have for continuing this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  offensive. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=94.55999999999999s)]
*  You know, I've seen the sentiment around a lot. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=95.55999999999999s)]
*  I heard it from people I like and trust and am colleagues with and friends, and I certainly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=98.32s)]
*  feel it the same way. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=104.96s)]
*  It's like at some point you just almost feel like you're out of words, out of horror and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  disgust and rage to express. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  The more you see, and I do think it's gotten worse in terms of the resumption. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=113.4s)]
*  You could probably compare it to the early couple months where there was this indiscriminate [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=118.08s)]
*  bombing and huge numbers of people killed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=121.16s)]
*  We're kind of back to that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  But on some level, even worse when you add in the purposeful blockading of any food getting [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  in the use of mass starvation as a form of collective punishment and driving people out, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=129.24s)]
*  forcing them to side between starving to death or leaving and giving that land of theirs [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=134.24s)]
*  to the Israelis. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=139.16s)]
*  How do you compare what we're seeing in Gaza to other atrocities and war crimes and the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=140.72s)]
*  like that say we've seen over the last several decades? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=148.68s)]
*  Well, I think this is a genocide. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=152.88s)]
*  And I would put it in the same category as what happened in Rwanda, what happened in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=156.56s)]
*  Cambodia and what happened in World War II with the Nazi Holocaust. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=161.28s)]
*  I mean, the basic goal here is to kill a huge number of people in the Palestinian population. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  And that, I think, easily qualifies as a genocide. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=176.56s)]
*  And in fact, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both done lengthy reports [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=180.8s)]
*  that lay out the case for genocide. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  And I find those cases compelling. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=188.7s)]
*  So I think this is a lot like those other cases. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=191.26s)]
*  I know a lot of people, even people who might be uneasy or even critical of what the Israelis [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  are doing in Gaza, nonetheless, have a very kind of visceral, almost primal opposition [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=202.6s)]
*  to applying the word genocide to what the Israelis are doing in Gaza. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=207.64s)]
*  And they may say things like, oh, look, if they're going to just wipe them all out and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=211.92s)]
*  eradicate them, they have the weaponry to do so. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=215.16s)]
*  And they have not done that yet. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=218.2s)]
*  And I guess some people at the same time say, does it really matter if this is called a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=220.56s)]
*  genocide? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=225.16s)]
*  I know you've used that word before. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=226.16s)]
*  You just used it again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=227.56s)]
*  What is your understanding of exactly what a genocide is? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  How do we recognize that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=231.62s)]
*  And why does it apply? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=232.78s)]
*  Well, I guess why is it important to use that term for this case? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=233.78s)]
*  Well, there's a clear-cut definition in international law, which was by and large established as [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=236.96s)]
*  a result of the Nazi genocide in World War II. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=244.68s)]
*  And it involves focusing on killing a large portion of a particular population. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=250.28s)]
*  That population could be based on ethnicity or religion or what have you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=257.16s)]
*  But the point is that what you're aiming to do is kill a huge chunk of a particular population. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=262.32s)]
*  Now that can happen rapidly. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=270.2s)]
*  It can happen slowly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=272.52s)]
*  But does that really matter? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=274.12s)]
*  If you were to kill three million people in a particular group over five years, would [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=276.16s)]
*  that be any different than killing those people over five months? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=282.92s)]
*  I think the answer is no. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think you therefore really can't compare genocides with one another. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=290.02000000000004s)]
*  The same way you can't compare apartheid in one system with apartheid in another system. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=297.44000000000005s)]
*  Over the years, many Israelis have argued to me that Israel is not an apartheid state [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=304.32s)]
*  because it's different than South Africa. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  But the point is comparing Israel to South Africa doesn't deal with the question of whether [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=312.9s)]
*  or not Israel is an apartheid state. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=317.52s)]
*  You have a general definition of what an apartheid state is. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=320.11999999999995s)]
*  And then you have to ask yourself the question, does South Africa and does Israel fit with [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  that category of apartheid? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=329.0s)]
*  And the same thing is true with a genocide. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=331.88s)]
*  There's no question that there are fundamental differences, and I would note fundamental [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=334.36s)]
*  similarities between the Nazi Holocaust and what's going on in Gaza. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=338.76s)]
*  But the fact is that there are also fundamental differences. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=343.42s)]
*  But if you look at the definition of genocide, you can categorize what's happening in Gaza [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=346.76s)]
*  as a genocide. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=353.28s)]
*  And as I said, if you look at what Human Rights Watch and what Amnesty International have [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=354.6s)]
*  done on this count, they lay it out that this is a genocide. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=359.48s)]
*  One of the—well, it's so ironic, I guess, you can use a sort of lighter word than is [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=365.04s)]
*  merited about what is happening is that so much of the international law and the conventions [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=370.8s)]
*  that emerge, including the Geneva Conventions, the new Geneva Conventions that emerge after [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  World War II were specifically designed to prevent things like the Holocaust from happening [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  again. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=386.6s)]
*  One of the prohibitions that the world agreed to was a prohibition on collective punishment. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=387.72s)]
*  The Nazis would go to France, and if there was somebody in the resistance in a certain [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=392.12s)]
*  town, they would say, turn them all over. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=395.68s)]
*  We're going to kill 20,000 of the people in the town without respect to whether they [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=397.48s)]
*  actually did anything. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=402.0s)]
*  It's collective punishment. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=403.0s)]
*  We're going to punish this town if it produces somebody who is working against us or has [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=404.0s)]
*  in some way taken up arms against us. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  And there's a war crime prohibition on collective punishment among a whole using food as a weapon [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  of war and mass starvation and the like, all the things the Israelis are doing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=417.64s)]
*  And I kind of get the sense, and maybe this is actually a pervasive propagandistic success, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=420.64s)]
*  is that when people talk about, say, the Nuremberg Trials or war crimes or even the phrase never [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=428.24s)]
*  again, they seem to think that what it means is these are principles to protect Jews and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=434.36s)]
*  only Jews and not the rest of humanity, and therefore you cannot have a genocide perpetrated [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=442.16s)]
*  by Jews only against them, or you can't have collective punishment and war crimes perpetrated [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=447.48s)]
*  by Jews only against them. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=451.08s)]
*  Do you think that is a kind of common ethos in the West? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  I think deep down inside, most Jews do believe that, that the word genocide cannot be applied [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=457.72s)]
*  to anyone other than the Nazis in what happened between 1941 and 1945. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=465.32s)]
*  Glenn, let me say a word about collective punishment and use my discussion of that term [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=475.08s)]
*  to distinguish between how I think the genocide against the Jews evolved and how this genocide [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=480.84s)]
*  in Gaza evolved. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=488.8s)]
*  I don't think collective punishment... [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=490.8s)]
*  Just to be clear, when I was talking about collective punishment, I wasn't necessarily [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=492.8s)]
*  using it as how the Holocaust evolved. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=496.68s)]
*  There was a lot of collective punishment there, but even, like I said, in places like Nazi-occupied [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=498.68s)]
*  France, against the French resistance and the like, it was used there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=503.16s)]
*  But I'm definitely interested... [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=506.16s)]
*  I just wanted to be clear about what I was saying, but definitely I'd like to hear what [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=507.16s)]
*  you have to say with this distinction. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=510.56s)]
*  Okay, but I think with regard to the Nazi Holocaust, from the get-go, there was not... [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  The aim of collective punishment was not at play. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  The aim was to annihilate all of European Jewry, or at least that portion of European [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=525.44s)]
*  Jewry that the Nazis could capture. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=530.96s)]
*  So it wasn't collective punishment at all. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=535.96s)]
*  I think the way the genocide in Gaza has evolved is different. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  I think after October 7th, the Israelis concluded that if they really punished the civilian [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=543.68s)]
*  population in Gaza, that that would cause that population to leave. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=550.68s)]
*  So I don't think the initial goal was to murder huge numbers of Palestinians. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=556.78s)]
*  It was definitely to inflict massive punishment on the Palestinian population and to make [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=561.78s)]
*  the place unlivable. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=568.66s)]
*  But what happened is that the Palestinians didn't leave, and the Israelis, therefore, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  had to constantly up the ante, which is another way of saying they had to constantly up the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  bombing campaign. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=582.78s)]
*  And the end result is that over time, I believed it morphed into a genocide. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=584.78s)]
*  As I said at the time, I didn't think in the fall of 2023 that it was a genocide. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=590.26s)]
*  But by late 2023, given that the Israelis had been unable to drive the Palestinians [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=595.8199999999999s)]
*  out and were continuing to punish the population and were increasingly frustrated and therefore [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=601.3s)]
*  increasingly ramping up the punishment, it morphed into a genocide. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=607.9s)]
*  And of course, it's just gotten worse and worse over time. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=613.54s)]
*  One would have thought that once the ceasefire was in place, this was the day before President [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=617.66s)]
*  Trump was inaugurated, January 19th of this year, that we had put an end to the genocide [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=622.5799999999999s)]
*  and we would then just have to deal with the suffering in Gaza and hopefully ameliorate [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=631.26s)]
*  that to the point where fewer people would die than we thought would happen if the genocide [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=636.98s)]
*  continued. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=643.14s)]
*  But then Trump began to talk about what his view was of Gaza. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=644.14s)]
*  And he basically gave the Israelis the green light to start the campaign of genocide all [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=649.38s)]
*  over again. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=655.66s)]
*  And that, of course, is what's happened. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=657.3s)]
*  And the Trump administration has said hardly anything about what the Israelis are doing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=659.06s)]
*  And the media and leading politicians in the West have said hardly anything. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=664.78s)]
*  So the Israelis are pretty much free to do anything they want to the Palestinians and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=670.74s)]
*  hardly anyone except for a handful of people like you and I will stand up and say that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=676.12s)]
*  this is fundamentally wrong and has to stop. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=680.78s)]
*  If your dog is constantly itching, scratching or dealing with hot spots, you've got to check [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=685.14s)]
*  out Cote Defense. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=691.72s)]
*  It's an all-natural solution that's been helping so many dogs. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=692.72s)]
*  And here's why this product caught my attention. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=696.98s)]
*  And I've seen firsthand, both with all the dogs we have at home, above 25, as well as [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=699.02s)]
*  the dog shelter we created and continue to operate, how often dogs develop things like [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=704.02s)]
*  yeast infections, especially in their paws and ears and skin fold. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=708.42s)]
*  It's really more common than people realize. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=712.22s)]
*  The usual treatments, though, like steroids and antibiotics and Ciddlepoint and Apiquel, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=714.62s)]
*  they might cover up the symptoms for a while, but they don't actually fix the root cause. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=719.48s)]
*  And in some cases, they actually make things worse over time. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=724.16s)]
*  Cote Defense is different. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=726.96s)]
*  Their deli-preventative powder works as a dry shampoo, odor eliminator and anti-itch [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=728.18s)]
*  powder, but what makes it special is that it eliminates yeast naturally by changing [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=732.9799999999999s)]
*  the terrain on your dog's skin so that yeast and bacteria can't survive. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=737.4599999999999s)]
*  No toxic chemicals, no synthetic junk, just safe natural ingredients. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=741.8199999999999s)]
*  They also make an aloe-based sensitive skin shampoo that calms irritated skin, preserves [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=745.14s)]
*  natural oil and microbiome, and is totally free of parabens, sulfates and anything artificial. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=750.4599999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I would never recommend, especially a dog product, unless I know that it's safe [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=755.94s)]
*  and effective. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=761.1400000000001s)]
*  I've been really surprised reading all the testimonials about how it works and then also [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=762.1400000000001s)]
*  seeing it firsthand with our dogs at the shelter. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=766.22s)]
*  I've heard from so many people that this is the only thing that has actually worked after [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=768.86s)]
*  years of frustration with dogs finally itch-free and healthy again, and that's why I'm happy [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uypAZMwzJ9U&t=771.7s)]
