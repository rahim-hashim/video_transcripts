# Media Class Bows to Biden's Royal Court at WH Correspondents' Dinner
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s)
*  Every year for as long as I can remember the White House correspondence from the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=0.0s)]
*  White House Press Corps throws a very gaudy sleazy klutzy party for itself and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=10.52s)]
*  they throw it for themselves at the White House and it's traditionally [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  attended by the president by all the top members of the administration. Donald [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=23.12s)]
*  Trump refused to attend one of the years to his credit but it's a tradition in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=28.2s)]
*  Washington and every year that goes by it gets gaudier and more ostentatious [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=34.28s)]
*  and sleazier. It's designed essentially to allow these journalists, these media [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=39.4s)]
*  personalities to get to pretend that they're celebrities attending their [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=47.44s)]
*  Oscars, the Washington version of Oscars they have. B-list and C-list celebrities [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  who come they pose for them with them on the red carpet and their massive [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=56.76s)]
*  corporations pay for tables and they now start having after parties they have the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=62.36s)]
*  Axios party and the Politico after party just like the Oscars it's all [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=65.92s)]
*  designed to enable these people to feel like they are integrated elevated [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=70.2s)]
*  members of the royal court getting to dress up in their finery having the New [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=76.2s)]
*  York Times write about the outfits that they're wearing. I was watching a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=81.68s)]
*  documentary over the weekend about the journalist at the local newspaper Newsday [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=89.68s)]
*  which is located on Long Island it's been a great local paper for a long time [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=96.28s)]
*  they have I think something like 20 Pulitzers over the last 30 years for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  just doing the kind of shoelace lace reporting that local newspapers have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  always been known for and they featured this one journalist in particular who [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=109.8s)]
*  was obsessed with documenting the mafia and the gangsters who ran the mafia in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=114.28s)]
*  places like Ozone Park in Queens and various neighborhoods in Brooklyn and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=121.28s)]
*  he's now deceased but they showed pictures of him and video of him and he [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=126.88s)]
*  was this very overweight guy he wore these very unkempt clothes he couldn't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=131.6s)]
*  even close the neck on his collar he was very unkempt he just worked in the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=138.04s)]
*  newsroom and he was just this like outsider guy this working-class guy it [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=143.56s)]
*  was a working-class profession they relied on guilds and unions in order to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=147.88s)]
*  secure their benefits and the people who went into journalism for the most part [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=151.72s)]
*  the ethos of journalism was that they were working-class people who wanted to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  take American elites down as many notches as they could it was an actual [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=160.32s)]
*  adversarial relationship between the press and the government now I don't [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=165.64s)]
*  want to romanticize that there's been a long time of great deference from the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  national media toward government but the ethos of journalism was that these [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=174.6s)]
*  people were supposed to be outsiders and one of the things that changed most in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=179.0s)]
*  American journalism is that these newspapers and news outlets went from [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=183.6s)]
*  being locally owned by families who considered it almost like a public trust [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  to everything becoming corporatized so the major networks the major cable [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  outlets all started being eaten up by these major corporate conglomerates and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  so ABC and CNN and CBS and MSNBC and the New York Times the Washington Post these [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=203.08s)]
*  are all became just units in corporate conglomerates like any other unit like [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=212.68s)]
*  the insurance unit or the financing unit just the entertainment unit and it was [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=218.44s)]
*  all run the same way through the same mindset and the people who thrive in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=226.2s)]
*  corporations and major corporations are radically different than the people who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=230.96s)]
*  thrive in local newspapers you're not outsiders at all the ethos of a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=234.44s)]
*  corporation is to meld as much as possible into the corporate machinery [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=239.6s)]
*  and because these corporations have so much business with the government the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=244.6s)]
*  last thing they want is any real animosity between their media outlets [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=248.48s)]
*  and the government they supposedly cover and the kind of people who thrive and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=252.32s)]
*  who get attracted to these positions on the national level and who are hired [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=257.68s)]
*  from them are now all graduates of Harvard and Yale they're not graduates [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=260.76s)]
*  of community college or working-class people at all they're the kinds of people [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=264.28s)]
*  who could easily be working for the government they just chose instead to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=267.44s)]
*  the media department of this machine of which they're very much a part and the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=271.32s)]
*  relationship with the government is one of servitude we were just demonstrating [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=277.11999999999995s)]
*  how willingly they lie how often they disseminate disinformation that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=283.96s)]
*  advances the interests of the American government and so this festival this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=288.67999999999995s)]
*  pageant this disgusting spectacle that they have every year where they dress up [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  and go to the White House and pose on red carpets and give speeches heralding [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=298.92s)]
*  themselves and the president stands up and talks about how much he loves the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=304.92s)]
*  media because of course he would why wouldn't he and he hugs all the people [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=307.76s)]
*  who get awards from all these media outlets that serve his agenda as [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=311.32s)]
*  nauseating it is to watch and it is nauseating it also has a great value [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=315.44s)]
*  which is is very revealing of the actual relationship between these servants of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=320.12s)]
*  the of the royal court that's really what it looks like it's the White House [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=326.56s)]
*  and Washington is a royal court run by the members of political royalty and they [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=331.64s)]
*  invite in behind the walls of Versailles whoever serves the interest of the king [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  and that is their propagandists their spokespeople who get to go and dress up [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=344.2s)]
*  and be treated like honored guests of the king because they are part of the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  they're so proud of that they're so so fulfilled by it that they're embraced by [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=354.56s)]
*  the very people they're supposed to be impeding the New York Times covered this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=360.24s)]
*  event as exactly what it was intended to be as some kind of chic event where [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=366.56s)]
*  people dressed up and they you had to talk about which designers were putting [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=372.12s)]
*  on which journalists and here's what the New York Times said on April 27th quote [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=380.48s)]

*  campy more staid prelude to the Met Gala which take place only days later it's [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=406.52s)]
*  only fitting really given the subtext of journalists being jailed around the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=413.2s)]
*  world somehow the fact that journalists are being jailed around the world means [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  that American corporate journalists with their pedicures and their manicures have [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=422.24s)]
*  to dress up in Armani tuxedos and Versace gowns and go pose at the red [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=427.68s)]

*  that populate the guest list not that it's just the celebs off eight with [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=448.72s)]
*  stylists and designer brands who are working the entrances this year's [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=454.16s)]

*  accessories have practically become part of his political platform he even turned [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=462.16s)]

*  of Julian Assange so too will the press corps pay tribute to the journalists [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=550.4s)]

*  than every person in that room combined who's being imprisoned and killed by Joe [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=566.6s)]
*  Biden they can't mention him because they cannot displease the king otherwise [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  they will lose their access to the royal court so listen to them and their [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=576.0s)]

*  correspondent Evan Groskovich [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=593.0s)]
*  could you even remotely conceive of the very possibility that sitting in front [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=623.04s)]
*  of standing next to Joe Biden who's just a few feet away on the day on the dais [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=630.96s)]
*  that they would mention the journalist who Joe Biden himself is prosecuting [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=636.4s)]
*  and killing Julian Assange it's inconceivable that they would even [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=641.96s)]
*  mention Julian Assange or Gonzalo Lira let alone stand and applause and pay [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=645.84s)]
*  tribute to the injustice of the imprisonment of that journalist even [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=652.56s)]
*  though Julian Assange as I said is responsible for more major stories over [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=658.4799999999999s)]
*  the last 15 years than all of these royal court servants combined but they [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=663.16s)]
*  are servants of the US government so of course the last thing they're gonna do [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuWf8DN3s&t=671.3599999999999s)]
