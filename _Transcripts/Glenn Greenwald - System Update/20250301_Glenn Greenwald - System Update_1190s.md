# Trump & Zelensky's SHOCKING SMACKDOWN: Glenn Reacts
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA)
*  I also wanted first to cover what was truly an extraordinary event. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, a historically extraordinary event that took place just a little while ago, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=11.52s)]
*  earlier this afternoon in the Oval Office where Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky came [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  to Washington primarily because he was summoned by President Trump and the Trump White House [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=21.92s)]
*  to do so. The Trump administration is very eager to reach an agreement is one generous way to put it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=28.24s)]
*  Pressure the Ukrainians to agree or submit to an agreement is probably the more accurate way to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  put it in which the United States will obtain very substantial rights to the crucial minerals in Ukraine [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=43.12s)]
*  many of which are in the Donbass region that the Russians currently occupy but many of which are [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=58.24s)]
*  simply spread throughout western Ukraine that are crucial for industrial growth, for there's some [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=62.32s)]
*  lithium there, there's all kinds of rare earth minerals that are necessary for future weapons [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=69.44s)]
*  as well and for a lot of other drivers of economic growth into the future that President Trump very [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=76.72s)]
*  much has his eye on and Trump brought this suggestion, this proposal and was a little bit [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=82.64s)]
*  ambiguous about it. Some people understood that he was offering it as a condition for [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=89.84s)]
*  continuing to fund the war in Ukraine essentially saying to Ukraine if you want us to continue to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=97.2s)]
*  finance and arm your war against Russia the condition is is that you have to give us the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=101.92s)]
*  rights to these minerals in your ground or 50 percent of it or become partners in it and a lot [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=107.6s)]
*  of people that led a lot of people including very good friend of our show great friend of our show [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=115.28s)]
*  one of our best friends of the show Michael Tracy to conclude that this was Trump essentially saying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  that he's going to continue to pursue Biden's policy of financing the war in Ukraine and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=124.32s)]
*  definitely he just wants some mineral rights as a condition for doing so. There was another [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=128.88s)]
*  interpretation though that I think was very viable which is that President Trump keeps saying [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=134.0s)]
*  that we gave 350 billion dollars to, apparently I sneeze even when I'm not in the studio, it's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=140.72s)]
*  only during the show though I swear I don't sneeze ever during the day maybe it's just psychological. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=150.8s)]
*  In any event President Trump has been very fixated on the fact that we gave 350 billion dollars in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=155.36s)]
*  his words to Ukraine that figure has been disputed but clearly it's in excess of 100 billion maybe [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=160.0s)]
*  200 billion and this isn't new during the campaign over the last couple of years he's been [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=164.88s)]
*  objecting to this and questioning and saying why is it in American interest why does the American [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=170.8s)]
*  worker have to finance the war in Ukraine and the other alternative is that he is determined to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=174.8s)]
*  get that money back through mineral rights and he continues to emphasize that he intends to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=183.04s)]
*  end the war in Ukraine that he intends to negotiate a deal between Ukraine and Russia [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=189.68s)]
*  for the war to end so it's not as if he is saying oh yeah I want to continue the war but I just want [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  to get mineral rights for it he keeps claiming that Europe's aid was in the form of loans and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=199.52s)]
*  grants that they'll get back some of which it was actually but not all of which whereas the United [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=204.56s)]
*  States just kind of gave this money with no expectation in return so it seems more plausible [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=209.44s)]
*  to me that what Trump is saying is we want our money back that we've given you and you'll get [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=214.88s)]
*  the benefit that if we have a vested interest in your country and extracting these rare earth [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=219.52s)]
*  minerals out of your country that that will provide a sense of security because we'll have [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  to have a physical presence there now obviously the Ukrainians don't want to sign away they're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=229.68s)]
*  very lucrative and valuable rights to these minerals but at the same time they have been [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=234.8s)]
*  relying upon and will and hope to continue to rely upon us largesse and Trump's view is why [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=240.24s)]
*  should we just give you this money so this visit from by President Zelensky to the White House today [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=245.92s)]
*  obviously took place in a context in which Trump has been saying very insulting things about [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=254.0s)]
*  Zelensky calling him a mid-rate comedian accusing him of being a dictator because he won't have [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=259.68s)]
*  elections of being extremely unpopular in his country a kind of war of words that took place [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=265.12s)]
*  Trump seemed to retreat a little bit on it when Ukraine K Prime Minister Kiri Strummer was in the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=270.32s)]
*  White House yesterday on Thursday and a reporter asked about him having called President Zelensky [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=275.92s)]
*  a dictator and he said something like oh did I say that but soon as Zelensky got there today [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=282.8s)]
*  Trump came to greet him outside of the White House dressed in the normal Trump presidential [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=288.88s)]
*  costume of a expensive suit and a silk tie and Zelensky showed up in his sweatshirt and jeans and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  President Trump immediately said oh look he came well dressed already kind of mocking and insulting [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=300.56s)]
*  Zelensky you know I guess at the beginning when Russia invaded in 2022 it made sense for Zelensky [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=305.84s)]
*  to prance around and camouflage or whatever because the idea was he had to go underground [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=312.96s)]
*  he was hiding he was commanding from a bunker now he's on the cover of vogue he travels around the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=316.56s)]
*  world he's constantly in Kiev this costume has no more validity but he continues to wear it and I [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=323.04s)]
*  guess President Trump didn't appreciate the fact that he showed up at the Oval Office for a meeting [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=329.68s)]
*  with President Trump with Vice President JD Vance dressed the way you might dress if you were going [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  to the mall or if you were hiking up a mountain and expected the weather to be a little bit nippy [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=342.16s)]
*  so that was the way that the meeting began now here is them in the Oval Office they sat down [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=350.96s)]
*  in the traditional place in the Oval Office where world leaders when they visit the White House [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=357.52s)]
*  end up sitting next to the President they were both surrounded by officials the traveling party [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=363.28s)]
*  that Zelensky brought with him and on President Trump's left was Vice President JD Vance and then [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=367.44s)]
*  next to him was Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Treasury Secretary right next to him [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=373.84s)]
*  and obviously world leaders argue all the time they fight all the time they have disagreements [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=378.72s)]
*  all the time especially in a case like this where there's been a war of words over the past [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  a couple of weeks but even longer going back there was a fear in Kiev that if Trump won [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  a to Ukraine could be endangered but a true war broke out a major confrontation that first involved [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  President Trump and President Zelensky Vice President Vance got involved and it just continued [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=407.76s)]
*  to escalate because Zelensky instead of doing what might have been wise given his dependency [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=414.0s)]
*  and his country's dependency on the United States kept interrupting talking over them fighting with [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  them and therefore fueling this disagreement making Trump as angry as I've seen him in public I've [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  never seen Trump raise his voice this way I don't know if I would say he lost his voice but I think [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=430.48s)]
*  control of his composure but he certainly lost his cool he clearly does not like Zelensky he [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  dislikes Zelensky's posture and he basically kept telling him look you're in no position to do [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  anything but come here with your hat in your hand and you should be expressing gratitude to us [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=450.08s)]
*  and instead you're very ungrateful you're very demanding and you're going to risk World War III [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=455.67999999999995s)]
*  you're playing games with the lives of millions of people including your countries it was remarkably [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=461.84s)]
*  contentious public argument that I think isn't just about personality clashes but is about some [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=467.28s)]
*  very deep seated disagreements that clearly the Trump administration and President Trump in [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=476.55999999999995s)]
*  particular have with Zelensky with Ukraine now there's been reporting that Biden used to get [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=482.64s)]
*  very angry with Zelensky as well to the extent that Biden knew what was going on he felt like [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=488.0s)]
*  Zelensky was constantly asking for more money and there have been reports that Biden got very angry [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=492.64s)]
*  on various calls but none of that happened in public here is just a segment of what took place [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=498.64s)]
*  the remarkably just contentious and confrontational exchange between Vance and Trump on the one hand [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=505.84s)]
*  and President Zelensky on the other I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=514.4s)]
*  the destruction of your country yes but if you are not strong with respect I think it's [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=518.8s)]
*  disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  media right now you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=526.88s)]
*  you have manpower problems you should be thanking the President for bringing into this conflict [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have I have been to come once I have [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=537.28s)]
*  actually I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people you [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=542.4799999999999s)]
*  bring them on a propaganda tour Mr. President are do you disagree that you've had problems [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=548.56s)]
*  what bringing people into your military and do you think that it's respectful I will answer to come [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=553.68s)]
*  to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=557.92s)]
*  trying to prevent the destruction of your country a lot of a lot of questions let's start from the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=562.64s)]
*  beginning sure first of all during the war everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  and don't feel now but you will feel it in the future you don't know that God bless you don't [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=573.9200000000001s)]

*  problem don't tell us what we're going to feel I'm not telling you because you're in no position [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=584.64s)]

*  military equipment you and your men are brave but they had to use our military what about [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=682.08s)]
*  this if you didn't have our military equipment you invited me if you didn't have our military [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=686.64s)]
*  equipment this war would have been over in two weeks it's going to be a very hard thing to do [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=691.6s)]
*  business like this I tell you just say thank you I said a lot of times to American people except [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  that there are disagreements and let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=703.12s)]
*  out in the American media when you're wrong we know that you're wrong but you see I think it's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=708.24s)]
*  good for the American people to see what's going on I think it's very important that's why I kept [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  this going so long you have to be thankful you don't have the cards you're buried there you [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=717.04s)]
*  your people are dying you're running low on soldiers listen you're running low on soldiers [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=724.0s)]
*  it would be a damn good thing and then you can then you tell us I don't want to ceasefire I don't [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=730.4s)]
*  want to ceasefire I want to go and I wanted this I look if you could get a ceasefire right now I'd [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=734.96s)]
*  tell you you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed of course we [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=741.36s)]
*  want to stop the war but you're saying you don't want to see but I said to you I want to see [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=745.6800000000001s)]
*  so I guarantee because you'll get a ceasefire faster than any now it is true people often point [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=749.36s)]
*  out and I think rightly so that a lot of what Donald Trump says a lot of what he does a lot [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  of what he threatens he will do a lot of what he predicts will happen is his way of trying to [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=763.12s)]
*  gain an upper hand in negotiations if anything if he prides himself on anything it's priding [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=770.8s)]
*  himself on being a good deal maker that's been his brand and his identity going all the way back [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=775.44s)]
*  those decades when he was a real estate developer in New York and then a casino developer the name [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=782.4s)]
*  of his book is you likely know is the art of the deal this is how he thinks of himself above all [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=788.24s)]
*  else as somebody who's not just a deal maker but drives a very hard deal so when he's yelling at [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=793.68s)]
*  Zelensky when he's insulting him when he's telling him he has no leverage it very well might be on [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  some level an attempt to force Zelensky into doing a deal that President Trump perceives as favorable [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=805.36s)]
*  to the country and even if it's disfavorable to Ukraine by saying look you have no leverage [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=811.52s)]
*  you need us you have no cards to play you're going to basically sign whatever we tell you to sign [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=818.24s)]
*  because if you don't we'll cut off aid to you and you'll have no chance to fight the Russians you'll [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=822.7199999999999s)]
*  have no leverage your country is going to be gone so it might have been some of that but clearly as [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=828.16s)]
*  I said the way in which Trump Trump's comportment was so different than it normally is I mean even [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=835.52s)]
*  when he's very angry at the press he'll be snide maybe he'll be insulting it's always with a kind [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=841.8399999999999s)]
*  of light demeanor he doesn't like to show that he's someone's gotten to him that someone's made [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=846.96s)]
*  him angry here clearly I don't think it was just Zelensky today I think the whole situation [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=852.08s)]
*  of Zelensky demanding more money constantly of always complaining that it's not enough [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=858.96s)]
*  is something that clearly Trump is angry about angry towards Zelensky angry toward Ukraine angry [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=863.6s)]
*  toward the Biden administration resentful toward Europe and that is likely to have an effect on [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=870.96s)]
*  how President Trump treats Ukraine going forward but I think the most important thing continues to [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  be Trump vowed when he ran that he would open relations and communication with the Russians [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=883.76s)]
*  in order to end the war in Ukraine promptly he continues to say that's his goal so this idea [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=890.1600000000001s)]
*  that some people have including as I mentioned Michael Tracy that he's really just trying to [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=896.8s)]
*  continue the war indefinitely and wanting to get as much as possible for it seems inconsistent to me [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=900.7199999999999s)]
*  with the rhetorical goal he continues to set for himself the metric of success that he continues [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=907.76s)]
*  to define which is that he intends to end this war and and this war quickly he constantly says [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=913.92s)]
*  he wants to be known not just as a dealmaker but as a peacemaker and so if this war continues to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=921.5200000000001s)]
*  just go on indefinitely I think Trump will consider himself to have failed in that goal that goal that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  he constantly sets for himself the metric he invites you to use to judge him by will be a [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=934.48s)]
*  failure so I don't think this was just a negotiating play I don't think Trump is envisioning [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=940.48s)]
*  this war going on for long he realizes it depends not just on himself but on Putin [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  and on the Russians and part of what I think was so interesting about that interview we did with [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=952.4s)]
*  Professor Dugan was despite this cartoonish image that the western media and the western [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=956.08s)]
*  governments like to depict of Russia being this totalitarian regime everybody is just subordinate [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=963.2800000000001s)]
*  to Putin Putin speaks and everybody obeys there's a lot of political pressure on Putin and it's [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  coming not from the faction that wants to end the war in Ukraine but the faction that's very [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=973.6s)]
*  concerned that Putin cares too much about integration into the west that he's too willing [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=978.96s)]
*  to make concessions and give too much away in order to get an agreement with Trump and and with [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=983.84s)]
*  NATO in order to end the war and so he has to be very careful and so it's not only up to Trump or [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  even up to Putin but about how much political space there is for Putin to be able to do the kind of [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=995.2s)]
*  concessions of the kind of negotiating that would be necessary to end this war but that is clearly [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1002.08s)]
*  Trump's goal he thinks this war is a waste he thinks it is dangerous he thinks it is creating [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1006.08s)]
*  a lot of unnecessary massive loss of life all of which is true but he also has to drive a hard [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1013.5200000000001s)]
*  bargain not just with Ukraine but also with Russia otherwise there won't be a deal done and I think [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  that continues to be and I hope it is what his actual goal is but you saw the spillover of what [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1024.8s)]
*  have been the long-standing tensions probably on Zelensky's part because he was the one who was led [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1031.04s)]
*  to believe he was the one who was encouraged and was told that oh don't worry you don't have to do [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1036.32s)]
*  a peace deal with Russia in the beginning after Victoria Nuland and Boris Johnson told him we the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1042.32s)]
*  west are going to continue to support you no matter what you do for however long it takes so just go [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1046.8799999999999s)]
*  to war with the Russians we'll give you everything we need we'll be behind you and as often happens [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1051.84s)]
*  with the United States either the policy changes the promises were in enduring the climate of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1058.72s)]
*  Washington changes and Zelensky's finding that from his perspective he prolonged this war he [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1065.44s)]
*  avoided a diplomatic or a solution because he was promised aid and now he's being told look either [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1072.4s)]
*  you sign your mineral rights away or we're going to cut off your aid and so I'm sure he's resentful [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1077.76s)]
*  as well he perceives himself as being the tip of the of the west of democracy fighting against Russia [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1082.32s)]
*  he clearly believes all of that but as Trump told him look you you're not winning you have no chance [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  to win your only goal should be to end this war otherwise you're not going to have a country left [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1094.4s)]
*  and it's I think rather cathartic actually to hear a president say that but also to hear a president [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1099.68s)]
*  say as he said yesterday when asked about the conditions for ending the war he said NATO is out [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1107.04s)]
*  Ukraine is never going to be part of NATO he said that's probably the reason the war began in the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1113.04s)]
*  first place and so rather than his caricature that oh Putin started the war because he's a [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1117.68s)]
*  psychotic monster even though we've heard for 25 years from five different presidents [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1123.2s)]
*  that he's rational and trustworthy and shrewd and cunning got turned into like some hillarion [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1127.92s)]
*  psychopath overnight who just wants to conquer the world regardless of the cost [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1134.0s)]
*  Trump said the reality is is that it was the US movement toward putting Ukraine and NATO that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1138.4s)]
*  likely provoked Putin into the war that was a factor in the war and it's also very refreshing [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1145.1200000000001s)]
*  to hear through realistic rather than a propagandistic or fairy tale view coming from [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1148.96s)]
*  the White House about what has been this horrific and at the end of the day completely unnecessary [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXQ8TgZ7KA&t=1154.48s)]
