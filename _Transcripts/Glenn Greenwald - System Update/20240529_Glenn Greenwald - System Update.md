# Humiliating Biden Fail: U.S. Pier Delivering Aid to Gaza Breaks
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc)
*  Now, the situation in Israel we covered at length last night, so I'm not going to redo [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=0.0s)]
*  all that reporting. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=11.44s)]
*  But the weakness of Joe Biden when it comes to the war in Israel is almost as severe as [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=13.5s)]
*  the weakness of Joe Biden when it comes to Ukraine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=17.76s)]
*  Back in January and February, when there were reports all over the place from aid organizations [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=21.7s)]
*  about famine in Gaza, how much the population was on the brink of famine and then dying [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=26.94s)]
*  of malnutrition, the Americans were insisting on allowing aid trucks or even U.S. military [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  trucks to enter Gaza through the Egyptian crossing, and the Israelis made clear they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=37.06s)]
*  wouldn't allow that, even though we're paying for their war, even though we give them all [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=40.86s)]
*  the weapons they need to fight it, even though they couldn't fight the war without us, the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  ones who dictate this relationship is Israel, and it's always been like that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=49.34s)]
*  So instead of demanding that the U.S. be permitted to enter Gaza in order to avoid having the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=54.58s)]
*  world see the United States responsible for a starving population that's dying of famine, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  the United States and Biden said, okay, sorry to ask, we understand, you won't let us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=66.62s)]
*  Can we build a pier that will allow us to deliver aid? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=71.56s)]
*  Now, a lot of people were very suspicious of that motive and said the motive was not [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=75.34s)]
*  to give humanitarian aid to Gaza, it was to help the Americans and Israel govern Gaza [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=78.68s)]
*  and control it once this war is over. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  But whatever the motive, the U.S. claimed it was to help Palestinians deliver aid, the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  pier was announced and then it was built and it was just completed about a week ago. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, it began to rain in that region and as soon as it began raining, this pier [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=100.56s)]
*  that the United States military just got done building at Joe Biden's order completely disintegrated, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=109.48s)]
*  it fell apart, it broke into small pieces and now it's floating away at sea. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=115.76s)]
*  I can't think of a more symbolically vibrant image of Joe Biden and his leadership in this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=119.56s)]
*  Here from the New York Times today, U.S. pier for Gaza aid is damaged by rough seas, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=128.12s)]
*  army engineers are working to put the pier back together and defense department officials [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=133.32s)]
*  hope it will be operational again in about a week. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=137.72s)]
*  The temporary pier that the U.S. military constructed and put in place to provide much [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=140.84s)]
*  needed humanitarian aid for Gaza has broken apart in rough seas, the Pentagon said on [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=144.62s)]
*  Tuesday. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  The latest calamity to befall the pier and to pier endeavor punctuated a particularly [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=151.12s)]
*  grim several days in Gaza where Israeli forces have ramped up attacks on the city of Ra'afah [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=157.88s)]
*  just two days after carrying out a deadly strike that killed dozens of people. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately we had a perfect storm of high sea states and then as I mentioned, this North [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  African weather system also came in at the same time creating not an optimal environment [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon deputy press secretary said at a news conference in early March, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=176.62s)]
*  President Biden surprised the Pentagon by announcing that the U.S. military would build [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=182.66s)]
*  a pier for Gaza defense officials immediately predicted that there would be a logistical [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=185.66s)]
*  and security issues and it turned out that this pier is pathetic. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=191.26s)]
*  We can't even build a pier in shallow waters to connect the land that allows boats to come [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=197.18s)]
*  and deliver things onto land. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=202.7s)]
*  Some of the most basic military operations when we fund the Pentagon with a trillion [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=204.22s)]
*  dollars a year that they can't account for. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=209.42s)]
*  Here's a picture of the broken pier, the pier that's not even connected any longer to land, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=212.34s)]
*  parts of which are now floating out at sea. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=216.26s)]
*  And Charles Lester, who is a foreign policy analyst said, quote, new, the U.S. has stopped [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=219.78s)]
*  all humanitarian aid efforts using the D.O.D. constructed maritime pier, which is now heavily [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=224.18s)]
*  damaged and floating and drift after bad weather. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=229.62s)]
*  Who would have thought maybe it would have been better to simply deliver aid via Gaza's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=233.7s)]
*  seven different land crossings. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=237.06s)]
*  But of course Israel didn't allow that and that's why we built this pier that is now [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=240.42s)]
*  disintegrating. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=244.7s)]
*  It's breaking up into tiny little pieces and the excuse is, oh, well it rained very hard. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=247.54s)]
*  It was a perfect storm, a bad weather as though you build a pier what just for days that it's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=251.38s)]
*  sunny and you hope it doesn't rain because if it does your pier is going to just break [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=257.54s)]
*  up into tiny little pieces and float out to sea and then you can't use it anymore. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=261.18s)]
*  The pier that you so flamboyantly announced you were going to build to help the people [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=265.46s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=268.46s)]
*  The White House is really at a point where it's pathetic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=271.42s)]
*  You see that with Ukraine, you really see it with Israel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=276.06s)]
*  That red line that Joe Biden pronounced he was imposing several months ago on Israel's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=278.98s)]
*  invading Ra'a was obviously ignored and violated by the Israelis. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  The Israelis laughed at that red line. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=289.61999999999995s)]
*  They said we're not going to pay attention to that red line. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=291.58s)]
*  Of course we're going to invade Ra'a the way we want. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=293.14s)]
*  And for the last two weeks their excuse has been, well Israel is not involved in a really [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=296.06s)]
*  heavy invasion or attack of Ra'a and so the red line is not violated. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=301.82s)]
*  And now the world has watched hundreds of Palestinians being incinerated by a fire that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  Israel caused with a bombing right in the sector where they had promised was a safe [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=311.78s)]
*  zone and now obviously journalists at the White House, even pro-Biden journalists are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=316.02s)]
*  asking how can you possibly claim that Joe Biden's red line wasn't violated? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=320.94s)]
*  And here's the national security spokesman John Kirby trying his best to justify how [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  somehow the Israelis didn't do what Joe Biden publicly said they can't do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=331.58s)]
*  So how does this not violate the red line that the president laid out? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=337.58s)]
*  As I said, we don't want to see a major ground operation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=341.02s)]
*  We haven't seen that at this point. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=344.56s)]
*  How many more charred corpses does he have to see before the president considers a change [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=346.26s)]
*  in policy? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  We don't want to see a single more innocent life taken and I kind of take a little offense [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  at the question. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  No civilian casualties is the right number of civilian casualties and this is not something [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=361.32s)]
*  that we've turned a blind eye to nor has it been something we've ignored or neglected [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=366.38s)]
*  to raise with our Israeli counterparts. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=370.26s)]
*  I mean honestly these spokespeople have to stand up every day like Matthew Miller in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=372.46s)]
*  the State Department, John Kirby here and in the Pentagon and Kareem Jean-Pierre who [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=377.9s)]
*  have to defend American policy in Ukraine and especially its enabling of this war in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=382.3s)]
*  Israel and they have to say that the red line wasn't crossed because Israel really didn't [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=387.26s)]
*  do much in Ra'aifa and then the reporters say well they just incinerated hundreds of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=394.62s)]
*  people many dozens of whom died including women and children. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=398.54s)]
*  How many do they have to kill before you say yeah now they're really attacking Ra'aifa [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=402.38s)]
*  and then John Kirby says how dare you I'm offended by that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=407.94s)]
*  We don't take for granted civilian casualties. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=411.92s)]
*  What has the United States done to rein in the Israelis in any way to stop the Israelis [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=414.1s)]
*  to impose any real limits on what they're doing in carrying out a war where more bombs [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=419.62s)]
*  are dropped on this tiny densely populated strip of land in the first two weeks than [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=425.1s)]
*  the United States often dropped in all of Afghanistan during the 20 years that we fought [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=428.5s)]
*  that war for the entire year. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=432.26s)]
*  Used bombs in the first several months, 2,000 pound bombs that the United States stopped [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  using all the way back in urban areas in Iraq because of how many civilian casualties occurred. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=438.22s)]
*  It's a war that is indiscriminate that obviously doesn't value Palestinian life and the United [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=445.02s)]
*  States is very much a part of it and these people have to get up every day and not only [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  justify it but try and reconcile Joe Biden's red line with the Israelis contempt for it [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=453.46s)]
*  and their violation for it because he knows that Joe Biden can't and won't do anything [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=459.62s)]
*  to stand up to the Israelis. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=464.0s)]
*  He can't do it politically and he doesn't want to do it because he's a lifelong supporter [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=465.29999999999995s)]
*  of Israel and so this is the kind of self-humiliation in which they have to engage every day. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=469.46s)]
*  Whatever you think about the war in Ukraine at the beginning and wanting to fight Russia, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=474.86s)]
*  whatever you thought about the war in Israel at the beginning and wanting to fight Hamas, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=478.1s)]
*  you cannot deny that Joe Biden's policies and presiding over these two wars have been [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=482.22s)]
*  nothing short of disasters in a way that has really not only humiliated him but made a [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=488.26s)]
*  major blow to the idea of American power in the world and American credibility in the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=494.1s)]
*  world because he just looks so weak, he can't complete a sentence and then he obviously [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=497.54s)]
*  can't enforce anything that he's saying and he leaves it to these underlings to do so [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=504.16s)]
*  and they just feed all kinds of obviously false and contrived rationale to justify all [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=508.8s)]
*  of this is happening and of course the press is completely confused why the American people [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=515.4s)]
*  don't want to reelect Joe Biden. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=522.08s)]
*  They're genuinely confused by that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=523.88s)]
*  They don't see any of this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO0G3QY7lc&t=525.26s)]
