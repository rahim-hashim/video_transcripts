# Was Trump Ever Really Putin's Puppet? Key Russian Analyst Aleksandr Dugin on Russiagate Hoax
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430)
*  So let me ask you, there was obviously a scandal, political scandal in the United States during [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=0.0s)]
*  the 2016 campaign when Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were competing to be the president. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=11.76s)]
*  And the argument was made, well, Trump is the candidate of the Russians. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=17.8s)]
*  Trump is who the Kremlin wants to win. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=21.86s)]
*  And they have a lot of animosity toward Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=25.64s)]
*  During Trump's first term from 2017 to 2020, he did things like send lethal arms to Ukraine, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=28.66s)]
*  whereas President Obama before him was very reluctant to do that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=37.06s)]
*  He also campaigned to have Germany and Europe stop buying natural gas through Nord Stream, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=41.0s)]
*  something very antagonistic to Russia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=45.78s)]
*  Is it true that in 2016, and it sounds like it from what you're saying, that you at least, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  and more broadly maybe the Russian government, had a preference for Trump to win? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=57.34s)]
*  So from the beginning of his campaign, when he has appeared for the first time on the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=62.46s)]
*  horizon, on the political horizon in the U.S., we have immediately remarked the difference [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=68.62s)]
*  between his strategy and globalist strategy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=74.94s)]
*  So from the beginning of his appearance, we would rather see him with sympathy, some [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=78.7s)]
*  sympathy, but there was no element of real intervention in his support. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  Everybody here in Kremlin, maybe beside myself, everybody here was convinced that Hillary [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=99.7s)]
*  is going, was going to win. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=107.6s)]
*  So that was just something funny, sympathetic, but we didn't accept him seriously. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  When he came to the power and when he has won, he was under pressure. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  So they have created this false strategy, fake new campaign to demonize him, to undermine [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=126.24s)]
*  his influence, that he is a marionette and an instrument of Putin. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=136.74s)]
*  And maybe he was obliged, because that was his first term, he accepted much more, he [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=144.66s)]
*  heard more opponents, people from the Republican Party and so on, and he tried to give the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=153.38s)]
*  impression that there is absolutely senseless. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=166.02s)]
*  So maybe that was the kind of driver to help more Zelensky. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=171.06s)]
*  But now the situation is totally different. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  First of all, the people from administration who made these claims that there was a kind [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=181.56s)]
*  intervention in favor of Trump, now they are in the court, they are fired, they are under [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=192.62s)]
*  inquiry. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  So if now somebody of serious position starts to repeat the same lies, it is already something, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=202.5s)]
*  a kind of crime. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=214.58s)]
*  So that is suspicious. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=216.16s)]
*  So Trump could not pay any attention for such slander and propaganda of his political opponents. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=218.0s)]
*  So he is totally free to deal with Russia in good terms, in bad terms. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=228.0s)]
*  That demands on how he consider what are the American interests in this field. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=235.44s)]
*  So he is totally free, so he could not discount absolutely any claim that he plays in favor [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=242.46s)]
*  of Russia, in favor of Putin, because it is already established fact that all that was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=252.12s)]
*  a lie. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=259.2s)]
*  So that is difference between Trump and the first term and the second term. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl2CYLq430&t=260.32s)]
