# Trump's Brazen Threats Against Iran: Heading Toward War?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco)
*  Okay, so there was a lot of attention this week or has been on the White House meeting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=0.0s)]
*  that took place between Donald Trump and President Bukele of El Salvador, because apparently [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=12.76s)]
*  what we all are supposed to believe is so obviously within America's interests and advance [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  our country's core interests in America first way is to establish some sort of penal colony [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=26.4s)]
*  in El Salvador, thereby importing it would seem the governance and the political and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  social customs of El Salvador into the United States or at least venerating the governance [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=42.06s)]
*  of El Salvador, because even though we have all this shiny prison infrastructure in the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=47.82s)]
*  United States that the taxpayers for better or worse have spent a lot of money establishing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=56.2s)]
*  a penal colony in El Salvador is the thing that we're told is obviously in our national [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=63.68s)]
*  interest and we'll cover that a bit later with Zaid Jelani who actually interestingly [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=70.12s)]
*  enough had an exchange today or was it last night recently on Twitter slash X with none [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=76.16s)]
*  other than JD Vance himself on that issue. So we'll go over that but I think there was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=82.88s)]
*  another aspect of that Bukele meeting that hasn't gotten enough coverage which is that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  Trump was asked about the Iran negotiations that are sensibly underway between the United [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=92.32s)]
*  States and Iran. It's the first known senior level contact between American senior leadership [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=102.0s)]
*  and Iranian senior leadership since the Obama administration when infamously Donald Trump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=111.24s)]
*  decided to withdraw after the Obama administration from Obama's signature foreign policy diplomatic [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=120.8s)]
*  achievement. You can criticize that achievement or herald it but it was his signature achievement [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=127.84s)]
*  I think it would be hard to dispute which was the Iran nuclear deal or the JCPOA. Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=134.96s)]
*  campaigned for president in 2016 denouncing that deal. I vividly recall him appearing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=141.72s)]
*  at a Tea Party Patriots protest in September of 2015 alongside Ted Cruz that was devoted [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=148.44s)]
*  to denouncing the JCPOA saying with Trump saying he had never seen a worse negotiated [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=156.84s)]
*  deal in his entire life. But anyway direct negotiations or at least direct contacts we [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=164.3s)]
*  don't really know the full extent of what's been discussed as of yet have begun between [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=172.34s)]
*  the United States and Iran as of this past weekend and Trump was asked about those negotiations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  So let's hear what he had to say. You said yesterday that you're making a decision on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=185.9s)]
*  Iran very quickly. What do you mean by that? Is that a decision to strike Iran? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=191.66s)]
*  Well they're problem very quickly. Iran wants to deal with us but they don't know how. They [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=195.94s)]
*  really don't know how. We had a meeting with them on Saturday. We have another meeting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=200.26s)]
*  scheduled next Saturday. I said that's a long time. You know that's a long time so I think [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=205.46s)]
*  that might be tapping us along. But Iran has to get rid of the concept of a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=210.22s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. He can't have a nuclear weapon. Nobody can have it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=217.34s)]
*  We can't have anybody having nuclear weapons. You know? We can't have nuclear weapons. And [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=221.58s)]
*  I think they're tapping us along because they were so used to dealing with stupid people [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=226.38s)]
*  in this country. And I had Iran perfect. You had no attacks. You would have never had October [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  7 in Israel. The attack by Hamas because Iran was broke. It was stone cold broke when I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=237.86s)]
*  was president. And I don't want to do it. I want them to be a rich great nation. The [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=245.1s)]
*  only thing is one thing. Simple. It's really simple. They can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=248.98s)]
*  And they got to go fast because they're fairly close to having one. And they're not going [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=254.34s)]
*  to have one. And if we have to do something very harsh we'll do it. And I'm not doing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=260.5s)]
*  it for us. I'm doing it for the world. And these are radicalized people and they cannot [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=265.74s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon. Does that include a potential strike on Iranian nuclear facilities? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=271.44s)]
*  Of course it does. Okay. So that's Trump being asked. Is he contemplating or does the outcome [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=276.36s)]
*  envisioned here include a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities? And Trump says, of course [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=286.6s)]
*  it does. Now Trump has been becoming more and more brazen with these overt threats against [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=293.08s)]
*  Iran, particularly since March 30th when he decided to place a phone call to Kristen Welker [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=300.44s)]
*  of NBC News, the host of Meet the Press, and tell Kristen Welker that if Iran does not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  submit to a deal that is satisfactory to the United States, there will be bombing like [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=315.2s)]
*  the movie There Will Be Blood. Remember that? It will be bombing the likes of which they [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=324.48s)]
*  have never seen before. That's what Trump called up Kristen Welker of NBC News and told [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=329.6s)]
*  her in a phone interview. Now there could be an extent to which people are inert by [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  this because Trump says a million things every day. Some are deliberately incendiary. Some [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=342.56s)]
*  are sarcastic. Some is trolling. Some may be earnest. Who knows? We can never quite [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  on what the proportion is here in terms of how we're supposed to interpret the endless cacophony [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=356.04s)]
*  of Trump remarks on a given day. But it is really worth noting that presidents hadn't tended to come [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=362.20000000000005s)]
*  out and publicly threaten Iran that they will be bombed in a time-bound period if they don't [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=372.44s)]
*  capitulate to U.S. demands. You have had previous presidents, including Obama, say stuff to the effect of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=382.2s)]
*  all options are on the table with respect to Iran. But it was seen as so obviously bellicose and so obviously [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=389.8s)]
*  impermissible diplomatically to come out and just blatantly threaten to bomb Iran. Why? Because in the case of Obama, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  if there was some potential diplomatic arrangement in the offing, which Obama subsequently did attain in 2015, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  then running around threatening to bomb Iran might be an impediment to achieving that because it could cast [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  dispersion, grave dispersion, on the intentions of the United States in its attempt to interact with Iran. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=435.96000000000004s)]
*  So I actually went and asked a handful of people who are Iran kind of policy [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=448.2s)]
*  experts who are involved with Iran policy professionally, know the history of Iran [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=455.96s)]
*  and U.S. relations really well. I asked them, is there a precedent of a U.S. president [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=465.56s)]
*  cavalierly coming out and just saying there will be bombing of Iran if X, Y, and Z doesn't happen? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=472.44s)]
*  And they say no, no, this is unique to Trump with the exception of Trump's first term, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=478.92s)]
*  when he did threaten after the Soleimani assassination in January of 2020 to bomb Iranian cultural sites. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=487.48s)]
*  Maybe we could bring up that tweet if somebody could find it or put it in after the show. But [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=497.24s)]
*  Trump did in January of 2020 threaten to bomb Iranian like ancient cultural sites [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=502.84s)]
*  after retaliation was threatened for his drone strike assassination of the top general of Iran [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=511.08s)]
*  and one of the most renowned national figures in Iran, Soleimani. But other than that, it's really [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=518.8399999999999s)]
*  not customary for presidents to be so bombastic in their public utterances with respect to Iran. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=525.64s)]
*  Now, there are certain ways in which Trump really does defy [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  foreign policy convention in a way that is salutary. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=540.68s)]
*  One hallmark example from the first term is when after some initial bluster, he did initiate direct [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=545.96s)]
*  diplomatic relations with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. Now, the negotiations with North Korea [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=554.76s)]
*  didn't ultimately result in a settlement because for one thing, Trump and his administration at [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=562.5999999999999s)]
*  the time insisted on maximalist demands around denuclearization that North Korea as a matter of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=569.64s)]
*  national pride or even personal pride on the part of Kim was never going to agree to. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=578.12s)]
*  But nonetheless, it did break a significant taboo for those [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  direct talks to even happen in the first place. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=590.52s)]
*  And it likewise breaks a taboo for Trump to be threatening to bomb Iran so openly, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  pursuant to some cobbled together negotiations, which it's not even clear are in particularly good [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  faith. So that just is an indication of how it could be a double-edged sword, meaning defying [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=613.64s)]
*  foreign policy convention can at times be salutary because foreign policy consensus [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=624.84s)]
*  is rife with failure, rife with insular clique type thinking, and often revolves around people [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=630.76s)]
*  who have a demonstrable track record of myopia and inhospitability to criticism or contrary ways [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=642.28s)]
*  of thinking. So Trump has at times the ability to disrupt that. But the double-edged sword is, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=653.32s)]
*  he could also say he's defying foreign policy convention because it hadn't previously been [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  conventional to just be openly threatened to bomb Iran as he's doing now repeatedly [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=667.72s)]
*  in hopes, presumably, that it could result in some diplomatic settlement because Iran is going to be [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=675.6400000000001s)]
*  so bludgeoned into submission that they're going to agree to maximalist demands imposed by Trump. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=681.48s)]
*  But who knows? It could also be a pretext for war. Trump could say, look, we made every effort [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=693.96s)]
*  to negotiate with Iran. We even defied some convention by resuming high-level contacts [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=701.08s)]
*  between the U.S. and Iranian senior leadership, but they were so obstinate that we had no choice [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=706.76s)]
*  but to launch this bombing campaign with Israel that we've been threatening for [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=712.36s)]
*  weeks. And actually, even in the 2024 campaign, Trump threatened it publicly then. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=719.0s)]
*  So let's take a look at what Steve Witkoff, who is becoming an all-purpose Trump envoy [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=727.24s)]
*  initially focused on the Middle East, and I think that is still his official title, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=737.0s)]
*  but he's also leading negotiations with Putin in Russia. But he was on Sean Hannity's show [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=743.88s)]
*  on April 14th, and he was asked by Sean Hannity about these ongoing negotiations. Now, there's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=752.84s)]
*  an undercurrent of humor here because Sean Hannity would have blown a gasket in any other [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=760.12s)]
*  way. And it's a chance in which a senior U.S. official was trying to justify the utility of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=766.04s)]
*  directly engaging with Iran, namely during the Obama administration, I can vividly recall Sean [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=772.4399999999999s)]
*  Hannity thinking that even the mere fact of talking to Iranian senior leadership was [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  an abandonment of core American values or whatnot and giving credence to this Islamic terrorist [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=785.7199999999999s)]
*  or whatever. But nonetheless, of course, in the presence of Witkoff, he has to remain [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=793.8s)]
*  cordial. But anyway, Steve Witkoff here gives some details as to what the conditions might be to [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=798.4399999999999s)]
*  obtain a settlement with Iran. So let's take a look at that. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=808.1999999999999s)]
*  Let me go to Iran if I may and meeting face to face with the Iranian foreign minister, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=816.92s)]
*  the first known contact with the U.S. and Iran since the president took office. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=823.32s)]
*  Same question, but a different context. Are the Iranians trying to buy time? My understanding [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=828.0400000000001s)]
*  and public disclosures have them at and the IAEA report about 60 percent enrichment. To get from [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=834.12s)]
*  60 to 90 percent, which is weapon grade enrichment, is a very short period of time. Then they would [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=843.08s)]
*  need a delivery system. So my question is this. Both you and the president have been very adamant [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=849.48s)]
*  that the Iranians cannot get a bomb. I agree with both of you. I'm skeptical, like a lot of other [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=855.08s)]
*  people, how do you have a conversation with people that believe in a caliphate, convert or die, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=862.44s)]
*  and the notion that they've got to wipe Israel and the U.S. off the map. I don't know if it's [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=870.6800000000001s)]
*  ever going to be possible to get a deal with people that have that ideology and mindset. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=877.24s)]
*  How'd it go? Well, Sean, the president's message of peace through strength resonates throughout [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=883.8s)]
*  the world. This is not a threat on my part now. It is just a simple fact. The president means what [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=890.6800000000001s)]
*  he says, which is they cannot have a bomb. The conversation with the Iranians will be much about [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  two critical points. One, enrichment. As you mentioned, they do not need to enrich past 3.67 [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=906.28s)]
*  percent. In some circumstances, they're at 60 percent. In other circumstances, 20 percent. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=915.16s)]
*  That cannot be. And you do not need to run, as they claim, a civil nuclear program where you're [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=920.28s)]
*  enriching past 3.67 percent. So this is going to be much about verification on the enrichment [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=927.32s)]
*  program and then ultimately verification on weaponization. That includes missiles, the type [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=935.72s)]
*  of missiles that they have stockpiled there, and it includes the trigger for a bomb. And I think [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=943.08s)]
*  we're here to have, as the president indicated, and I take my direction from him every day, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=950.9200000000001s)]
*  that I go to work. We're here to see if we can solve this situation diplomatically and with [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=956.9200000000001s)]
*  dialogue. The first meeting was positive, constructive, compelling. I'm a trust but verify [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=963.96s)]
*  guy. Would it include, Steve, anywhere, any place, anytime, U.S. inspectors, not U.N. inspectors? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=971.24s)]
*  That would have to be critical. I don't trust the U.N. I don't think you do either. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=979.48s)]
*  Now, look, the devil, as you know, we've talked about this, the devil will be in the details of [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=982.6800000000001s)]
*  the document and hopefully we'll have that high quality problem of getting a document drafted. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=989.64s)]
*  But verification will be the key point that undergirds this agreement if we're fortunate [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=996.28s)]
*  enough to get there. Okay, so that was interesting because [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1004.0400000000001s)]
*  Witkopf says the issue would be that Iran couldn't enrich its uranium [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1010.76s)]
*  in its civilian use nuclear program above 3.67 percent. And why that appearance from Witkopf [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1018.9200000000001s)]
*  sends Iran hawks sputtering with rage is because that's the exact threshold [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1029.96s)]
*  which the JCPOA negotiated under Obama, which Trump then withdrew from on the grounds of it being [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1038.0400000000002s)]
*  a woefully inadequate deal that empowered the Islamic terrorist regime, etc. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1044.52s)]
*  3.67 percent was the uranium threshold that Iran was permitted per the terms of that deal [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1049.64s)]
*  to remain at. So this that sounded like potentially Witkopf at least tacitly acknowledging [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1055.0s)]
*  that per the terms of some eventual arrangements between the Trump administration and Iran now, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1065.4s)]
*  basically they could reintroduce a core component of the JCPOA, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1071.8s)]
*  which became this bugaboo for Republicans, including Trump himself, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1077.56s)]
*  who claimed it was so incompetently negotiated. It also tacitly assumes that Iran can have a nuclear [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1082.84s)]
*  program to begin with. Others in the administration like Mike Waltz, many Republicans in Congress, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1091.48s)]
*  are adamant that Iran must not be permitted to have any nuclear program whatever [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1098.04s)]
*  because they will always lie, cheat, and steal, and evade inspection, and their ultimate aim is [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1102.92s)]
*  to develop a nuclear program to target Israel or even the United States. So for Witkopf to at least [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1113.0s)]
*  express a seeming openness to permitting Iran to retain a nuclear program at all, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1119.3200000000002s)]
*  was a huge red flag for the hardcore anti-Iran hawks who have pervaded the Republican Party and to [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1128.44s)]
*  a smaller but still sizable extent the Democratic Party for many years. So there was a backlash [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1135.08s)]
*  to Witkopf's appearance there on Hannity's show on Monday night, and then lo and behold, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1143.16s)]
*  the following day, an official statement goes out from Steve Witkopf's government ex-account. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1152.6s)]
*  So he says, a deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1162.36s)]
*  whatever that means. I guess we have to read the art of the deal and hear about how Trump negotiated [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1168.4399999999998s)]
*  whatever that means. I guess we have to read the art of the deal and hear about how Trump negotiated [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1174.84s)]
*  to refurbish the Wolman rank in Central Park in 1987 to understand how that [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1183.16s)]
*  could be extrapolated into the contours of a deal with regard to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1188.6s)]
*  Witkopf says, any final arrangement must be set a framework for peace, stability, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1196.28s)]
*  and prosperity in the Middle East, meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1201.16s)]
*  and weaponization program. It is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1208.44s)]
*  will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do. So that was an apparent shift [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1215.24s)]
*  within a matter of hours between Witkopf indicating that it might be acceptable, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1221.8000000000002s)]
*  or it would even be acceptable. He stated it as fact. For Iran to retain its nuclear enrichment [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1226.84s)]
*  program at or below the previous JCPOA levels, then there was this flood of fury from the usual [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1234.84s)]
*  suspects who have always craved a war with Iran, who are hardcore Israel hawks. And obviously, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1244.6s)]
*  toppling the Iranian government is like the fever dream of Netanyahu in particular, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1252.68s)]
*  but also much of the Israeli political culture at large. And then after that backlash, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1257.3200000000002s)]
*  Witkopf comes out and issues that statement in which he ups the ante, it would seem, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1264.3600000000001s)]
*  and says that, nope, never mind. Iran must eliminate its nuclear enrichment weapons and [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1271.16s)]
*  weaponization program entirely. Now, as Witkopf said in that video, the devil is always in the [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1277.56s)]
*  details, so there's always a way to like lawyer your out of some of the wording of these things. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1282.9199999999998s)]
*  And who even knows really to what extent Witkopf, when he goes on a Hannity show and is kind of [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1287.56s)]
*  freelancing, to what extent he reflects the will of Trump, or is he reflecting his own volition? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1295.24s)]
*  It's hard to say. I think it's probable that people within the administration don't even know [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1305.72s)]
*  much of the time because Trump likes to leave things a bit ambiguous as to who [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1310.52s)]
*  is most in concert with his agenda on any given issue. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1316.04s)]
*  But it tells you directionally where things could be going, right? The administration rushes to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1323.72s)]
*  clarify a potentially conciliatory statement from Witkopf. And then as a matter of official policy, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1330.44s)]
*  has him put out a maximalist demand. That would mean Trump actually is not willing to replicate [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1339.56s)]
*  the JCPOA, which allowed Iran to maintain a nuclear enrichment program below a certain threshold. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1351.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, is Iran going to agree to quote, eliminate its nuclear enrichment program? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1362.28s)]
*  Anybody who knows anything about Iran, and I've never been there, I'll admit that, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1371.56s)]
*  but there seems to be almost universal consensus, even among pro-Iran hawks, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1376.52s)]
*  anti-war people, etc., that the idea of Iran agreeing to totally dismantle or quote, eliminate [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1382.12s)]
*  its nuclear enrichment program is a complete non-starter. Again, it's a matter of national [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1391.3999999999999s)]
*  pride. But this is the rhetoric that is in keeping with what Netanyahu said last week, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1395.8799999999999s)]
*  and Glenn, I believe, covered this on the show. I certainly covered it, which is Netanyahu reported [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1402.2s)]
*  after he met with Trump on Monday of last week, that they jointly agreed that diplomacy could be [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1407.48s)]
*  feasible with Iran, but it would have to culminate in what Netanyahu said would be a Libyan model, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1414.92s)]
*  whereby Iran, for some unknown reason, would agree to, under US supervision, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1424.28s)]
*  dismantle or even blow up, to quote Netanyahu, their own nuclear program [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1438.04s)]
*  at the behest of the US and Israel. Now, it's true that Iran has been weakened considerably [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1445.32s)]
*  over the past year and a half. They even lack the state capacity to prevent their president [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1452.68s)]
*  from dying in a helicopter crash and inclement weather, so it's not like [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1461.48s)]
*  Iran necessarily is the most formidable foe of the United States that the US could ever have. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1464.84s)]
*  But it's still a big country. There is an ancient Persian culture that could be drawn upon, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1472.28s)]
*  you would think, that would maybe make it politically untenable for Iran to just become [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1482.52s)]
*  a subservience to the US in this way. And so you have to wonder, are these negotiations a pretext [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1489.72s)]
*  to make way for what seems to be a building clamor for a war with Iran? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4AoLSz9Lco&t=1504.28s)]
