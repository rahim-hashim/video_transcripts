# UNHINGED Questions About Snowden During Tulsi's Hearing Reveal Deranged DC Priorities
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE)
*  I think one of the most extraordinary exchanges of today and one of those [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=0.0s)]
*  extraordinary changes I've seen was the one that she had with the Democratic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=12.44s)]
*  Senator from Colorado Michael Bennett because it was it was really just [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=17.96s)]
*  unhinged. Actually we're going to get to that in a second. I want to start first [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=23.6s)]
*  of all with the ranking Democrat on the committee Mark Warner who is a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=29.88s)]
*  telecommunications tycoon, the richest Democrat in the entire Congress, the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=36.16s)]
*  third richest overall, one of those people who's going to fight the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=42.12s)]
*  oligarchy and he's the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=46.56s)]
*  Committee, a longtime defender of the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, etc. And I was [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=49.76s)]
*  surprised because he began by attacking Tulsi Gabbard. He went first among [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=54.92s)]
*  Democrats as the ranking member. He, the first thing he raised and the focus of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=58.88s)]
*  hearing was on her prior support for Edward Snowden and here's part of that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=62.6s)]
*  exchange. Do you still think Edward Snowden is brave? Mr. Vice Chairman, Edward [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  Snowden broke the law. I do not agree with or support with all of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=73.08s)]
*  information and intelligence that he released nor the way in which he did it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=77.68s)]
*  There would have been opportunities for him to come to you on this committee or [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  seek out the IG to release that information. The fact is he also, even as [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=85.96s)]
*  he broke the law, released information that exposed egregious, illegal, and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  unconstitutional programs that are happening within our government that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=95.88s)]
*  led to serious reforms that Congress undertook. Do you notice how he [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=100.8s)]
*  wouldn't, didn't want to hear her, he didn't want to let her say, did not want [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=105.52s)]
*  to hear that Edward Snowden revealed egregiously unconstitutional and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=109.56s)]
*  illegal programs? Because the Mark Warners of the world were the people who [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=114.36s)]
*  were endorsing those sorts of things when they were being done. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=119.72s)]
*  Edward Snowden didn't betray the American people. He served the American people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=123.48s)]
*  What he betrayed were the criminals inside the government who were allowing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=126.8s)]
*  our government to spy on us in unconstitutional legal ways and they [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=130.4s)]
*  would have gotten away with it if not for him and that's why they hate him so [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=132.92s)]
*  much. I don't think it's amazing that he's contesting her praise for Snowden [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=135.4s)]
*  as being quote-unquote brave. You can hate Edward Snowden all you want. You can [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=144.24s)]
*  think he's a traitor. You can think what he did was some sort of betrayal of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=149.52s)]
*  United States, somehow sorry that he forced you to realize that your [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=152.36s)]
*  government was spying on the internet and spying on you without warrants in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=156.72s)]
*  ways that are illegal and unconstitutional. He's deeply apologetic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=160.36s)]
*  for that. You can think all those things you want. The one thing you cannot deny [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=163.8s)]
*  is his bravery. This is somebody who sat inside the NSA for months and very [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=167.6s)]
*  systematically and carefully picked up their documents that he believed should [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  be in the hands of journalists so we could report them. He did it right under [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=180.68s)]
*  their nose and then when we met him in Hong Kong, a place he chose because it's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=183.32s)]
*  a symbol of resistance and liberty not part of mainland China, often opposed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=188.48s)]
*  to mainland China, he was working under the impression as were we that he was [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=193.2s)]
*  going to spend the rest of his life in prison. It was 98% in my mind that once [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  we left Hong Kong the next time we were going to see him was on the television [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=205.72s)]
*  inside a courtroom wearing shackles and an orange jumpsuit. How can anyone [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  contest that Edward Snowden is brave? You can contest a lot of things about what he [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=214.76s)]
*  did but not his bravery. It reminds me of when Bill Maher got fired shortly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=218.48s)]
*  after 9-11 from his politically incorrect program on ABC News because he [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=224.04s)]
*  said, look obviously you can think what the terrorists on 9-11 did was [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=228.28s)]
*  despicable, I do, but there's no denying their bravery. They hijacked planes and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=232.04s)]
*  flew a plane that they were piloting into a building knowing they were going [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=237.6s)]
*  to die for their cause. That's not cowardly. You can't deny their [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  bravery and he got fired for it because nobody wanted to hear that. Nobody was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=245.48s)]
*  ready to hear it. Here's the rest of this exchange. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  We got five minutes. So I take your answer and these are your quotes, brave, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=253.44s)]
*  please join my bipartisan legislation calling for charges to be dropped against [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=262.64s)]
*  him. Do you disagree that legislation was not appropriate? Do you believe he is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=268.32s)]
*  brave or not? Back those words. Once again Senator, Edward Snowden broke [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=275.44s)]
*  the law. He also released information that exposed the United States government's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=281.84s)]
*  illegal program. I really can't stand in these hearings the way they ask a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=287.92s)]
*  question and then two words into it they start interrupting. He asked multiple [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=295.08s)]
*  questions there. He didn't just ask one question and so she was trying to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=300.12s)]
*  explain what her view was which is presumably what he was asking for and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=304.56s)]
*  he just cut her off and it happened over and over and over today. And your [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=307.4s)]
*  words are still your beliefs. Yes or no, please. I'm making myself very clear. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=312.2s)]
*  Edward Snowden broke the law. He released information about the United States [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=318.88s)]
*  government's illegal activities. If I may just finish my thought Senator, in this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=323.88s)]
*  role that I've been nominated for, confirmed as director of national [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=330.26s)]
*  intelligence, I will be responsible for protecting our nation's secrets and I [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=333.72s)]
*  have four immediate steps that I would take to prevent another Snowden like [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  leak. Ma'am. She basically wanted to say the reason we got the Snowden leak was [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=342.24s)]
*  because our government, the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, were doing things they [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=346.68s)]
*  weren't supposed to be doing. We're engaged in illegal spying on the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  American people and then James Clapper went before the Senate and when asked [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  about it, falsely denied that the NSA was doing it and that was the ultimate [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=361.16s)]
*  last straw that broke the camel's back that made Snowden determined to go and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=365.88000000000005s)]
*  do this. That was March of 2013. He contacted me in December of 2012 [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  and we were meeting with him by the very beginning of June, the end of May, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=376.48s)]
*  beginning of June in Hong Kong and that was the precipitating event. And what [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=380.92s)]
*  she's saying is look if I'm the DNI I'm gonna make sure we don't break the law, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=387.44000000000005s)]
*  we don't lie to the American public, we don't violate the Constitution and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=390.68s)]
*  therefore we won't need any more of these types of leaks. All right, let's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=394.64s)]
*  continue with this next video and by the way just to underscore the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=401.16s)]
*  point and I know most people who watch this show already know it but just to be [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=409.92s)]
*  absolutely clear, here from the Guardian in September of 2020, the NSA [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=414.92s)]
*  surveillance exposed by Edward Snowden was illegal. The court rules seven years [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=420.2s)]
*  on. The spying program that the NSA was doing to spy an American citizen without [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  warrants was illegal. It was a violation of the Constitution and it was being done [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=432.48s)]
*  in secret. The only reason we know about it is because he had the courage to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  sacrifice his liberty to come forward and make us aware of it and he knew that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=442.0s)]
*  if he had gone to this committee, the first call they would have [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=445.96s)]
*  made was to the FBI. The only way he could have blown the whistle on this was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=450.08s)]
*  by doing what he did. And I just want to, I'm gonna let you see this this next clip [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  because this is really for me the crux of what actually happened which is this [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=462.08s)]
*  exchange that Tulsi Gabbard had with Michael Bennett of Colorado because he [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  became incredibly unhinged during the course of this exchange and he became [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=476.04s)]
*  very shrill, very upset and he to me is the kind of living breathing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=481.88s)]
*  representation of what the Washington establishment is of the reason why it's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  so hated, the reason why it's so destructive. It all came, became so [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=490.52000000000004s)]
*  manifest, so viscerally apparent in how he was speaking to her and the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=494.16s)]
*  things that he was saying. So let's take the time to look at this exchange. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=500.24s)]
*  Chairman, I would like to repeat my colleague's question to you. Thank you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=503.36s)]
*  for being here, for the to answer these questions and for your service. Was [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=508.72s)]
*  Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? Senator, I will also [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=517.24s)]
*  repeat my answer. He broke the law. You said earlier that you were offended by a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  question that my colleague from Kansas asked which I think was his duty as [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=528.36s)]
*  somebody on this committee to fulfill his responsibility to advise and consent. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=532.8s)]
*  We are not here to be a rubber stamp for the President of the United States. So let [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=539.92s)]
*  me ask you again, do you believe as the chairman of this committee believes, as [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=543.92s)]
*  the vast majority of members of our intelligence agencies believe, that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=549.3599999999999s)]
*  Edward Snowden was a traitor to the United States of America? Senator, I've [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=555.04s)]
*  confirmed this is when the rubber hits the road. This is not a moment for social [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=559.88s)]
*  media. It's not a moment to propagate theories, conspiracy theories, or [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=566.88s)]
*  attacks on journalism in the United States. This is when you need to answer [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=574.04s)]
*  the questions of the people whose votes you're asking for to be confirmed as the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=578.92s)]
*  chief intelligence officer of this nation. As my colleague said, this is not [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=586.44s)]
*  about you. It's about the people that serve the intelligence agencies of the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=594.5200000000001s)]
*  United States. Is Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=600.32s)]
*  That is not a hard question to answer when the stakes are this high. Senator, as [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=607.7600000000001s)]
*  someone who has served in uniform. Your answer, yes or no, is Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=616.16s)]
*  As someone who has worn our uniform in combat, I understand how critical our national security is. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=624.6s)]
*  Apparently you don't. Apparently you don't. Let me ask you. I've worked very hard to... [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  So let me just stop here and say this on this question of I demand that you [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=638.76s)]
*  denounce Edward Snowden as a traitor. It's not enough for you to say he broke [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=644.88s)]
*  the law, that you don't agree with certain things that he did. You have to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=648.32s)]
*  say he's a traitor. First of all, Tulsi Gabbard and Edward Snowden both did the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=652.12s)]
*  same thing after 9-11 while the people on this committee and those like them [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=658.76s)]
*  were voting for the United States to go invade in Afghanistan and voting for the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=662.96s)]
*  United States to go invade Iraq and bomb multiple countries all over the world. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=668.48s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard and Edward Snowden both answered that call. They both went to [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=672.96s)]
*  enlist in the military and volunteer to go fight in those wars because they [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=677.1600000000001s)]
*  believe their government when they said they were necessary to protect the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=680.0400000000001s)]
*  United States, they went to risk their lives in defense of the United States. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard has been in the military ever since. She continues to be a [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=686.84s)]
*  lieutenant colonel in the reserves. She has access to all kinds of classified [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  information and always had and her background check is completely clean as [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=695.32s)]
*  a whistle. She's never once gotten near any kind of breach of classified [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=698.76s)]
*  information. Edward Snowden went to defend his country. He then ended up in [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  the CIA because he broke both of his legs in basic training and couldn't [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=710.04s)]
*  deploy. He went to work for the CIA overseas. He went to work for the NSA and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=713.16s)]
*  it was only then did he discover the truth of what our government was [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=717.04s)]
*  actually doing to American citizens. The whole point of the US security state, the [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=721.4s)]
*  central taboo on which it was constructed, is that the powers of the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=725.08s)]
*  US security state were never supposed to be directed inward and used against the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  American people. They were only supposed to be directed outward. In fact it was [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  Frank Church, the liberal senator from Idaho who oversaw the Church Committee [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=739.08s)]
*  in 1970 and 1970s that investigated these abuses who said they have already [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=742.48s)]
*  developed such a potent technological means of surveillance that it forever [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=748.72s)]
*  directed inward it would be turnkey tyranny as he described it. We would have [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=753.36s)]
*  quote no place to hide. That became the title of my 2014 book that I wrote about [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=758.0s)]
*  my work with Edward Snowden. That was what he was saying that the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=762.12s)]
*  surveillance already in 1970s was so sophisticated that if they ever turned [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=765.08s)]
*  it inward on the American people you couldn't evade it. You couldn't escape it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=769.64s)]
*  There'd be no place to hide and after 9-11 people like Edward Snowden and many [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=773.12s)]
*  others who were inside the government discovered the government was doing [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=777.08s)]
*  exactly that and he came forth to alert the American people to the fact that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=780.36s)]
*  that was taking place. Now maybe you don't agree with everything Snowden did [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=786.04s)]
*  maybe you think he should have done this or that but the question of whether [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=792.64s)]
*  someone is a traitor to the country requires an intent to harm the country [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=795.48s)]
*  and to benefit America's enemies and think about once Edward Snowden had this [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=801.44s)]
*  archive in his hand filled with pop secret documents classified material [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=807.8s)]
*  material about our spying. Think about all the things he could have done with [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=812.1999999999999s)]
*  it if he had wanted to harm the country. He first of all he could have sold it [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=816.8s)]
*  quietly to some other government or governments or to non-state terrorist [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=820.4399999999999s)]
*  groups or actors of any kind and profited greatly and then gone off to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  some other country and hidden with his wealth and been wealthy for the rest of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=830.68s)]
*  his life he didn't do that. He could have secretly passed it to America's [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=833.64s)]
*  enemies just quietly as well he didn't do that. He could have just dumped it all on [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=838.08s)]
*  the internet without the slightest regard for what its implications would [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=843.64s)]
*  be he didn't do that either. Instead he came to American journalists myself who [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=846.92s)]
*  was at the time working at the Guardian or a poitras who created a partnership [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=852.08s)]
*  with the Washington Post and he said here's the archive the people who are [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=855.24s)]
*  going to make the decision about what gets released and what doesn't is not [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  myself it's you and he gave us very conservative instructions about how he [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=862.9s)]
*  wanted us to treat the archive that we don't publish anything that may put [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=868.3s)]
*  people in harm's way that we only publish enough to show people what they [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=871.4599999999999s)]
*  ought to know in the public interest he was incredibly conservative and careful [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=876.3s)]
*  whistleblower he could have done so much more if he had been a traitor to his [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=879.88s)]
*  country somebody trying to aid and abed America's enemies in times of war which [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=882.86s)]
*  is the formal definition of treason in the Constitution that I don't think any [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=886.78s)]
*  of these people have read he could have done all of that and he did it and so to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=890.02s)]
*  sit there and suggest that somehow Tulsi Gabbard is sympathetic to treason or [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=894.22s)]
*  that Edward Snowden is a traitor and so many of them spent all day doing exactly [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=899.1s)]
*  this think about all the things wrong with our intelligence community and the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=905.02s)]
*  only thing they were focused on all day was demanding that she call Edward [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=908.78s)]
*  Snowden a traitor because to them Edward Snowden is the root of all evil like [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=911.9s)]
*  Julian Assange is not because Edward Snowden harmed the country but because [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=916.54s)]
*  he harmed them because they're the ones who endorsed and supported and still [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=919.82s)]
*  support illegal and unconstitutional spying on American citizens here's the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=924.62s)]
*  rest of this you put your own words here in front of the committee not you know [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=928.22s)]

*  initiative like the conservative post-millennial described it. If I just [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsadZXPBMfE&t=1513.6000000000001s)]
