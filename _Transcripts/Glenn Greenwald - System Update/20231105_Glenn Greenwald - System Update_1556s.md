# Did the CIA Kill JFK? A Leading Expert Makes His Case | SYSTEM UPDATE with Glenn Greenwald
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE)
*  The focus on the CIA kind of comes and goes, ebbs and flows. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=0.0s)]
*  There was a great deal of focus on it in the mid-1970s with the Church Committee. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=11.92s)]
*  That was probably the first time Americans really got a clear glimpse of, not a full [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=16.52s)]
*  glimpse but still a clear glimpse of what the CIA was capable of doing when nobody was [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=21.64s)]
*  watching it with these kind of unlimited powers it had unmoored from any legal constraints. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=26.6s)]
*  But we actually started focusing again on it with the emergence of Donald Trump and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=32.88s)]
*  the kind of word that he waged and that he had waged on him by the CIA, by the FBI, kind [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=37.84s)]
*  of denounced him publicly. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  They did a lot to undermine his presidency. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=44.84s)]
*  And I think because the CIA has such a kind of mythical role in the United States, people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=47.08s)]
*  don't realize that it didn't always exist. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=53.32s)]
*  We didn't always have this part of the government that was completely secretive, that was there [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=56.28s)]
*  to kind of operate without democratic accountability. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=60.4s)]
*  It was this creation under Harry Truman with the National Security Act. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  When the CIA was created, when this kind of part of the US security state was created [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  to confront the Soviet Union to wage the Cold War, what was the thinking of the people who [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=72.9s)]
*  were doing it? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=78.72s)]
*  Did they have kind of a limited vision of what the CIA would be or did they ever imagine [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=79.72s)]
*  that it would end up being this kind of monster that was out of everybody's control? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=83.8s)]
*  Well, I think you put your finger on it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=88.64s)]
*  President Harry Truman, when he created the CIA in 1947, saw it as an agency that would [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=92.24s)]
*  just collate the information that the president needs about other countries. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=98.36s)]
*  He did not see it as a quote, Gestapo that was acting on its own to overthrow governments [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=103.52s)]
*  and kill people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=109.56s)]
*  So he thought President Truman that it was out of control and he couldn't control it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=111.48s)]
*  He wrote an op-ed piece only a week or so after the Kennedy assassination in 1963 saying [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  the CIA indeed was out of control and that it was overthrowing governments and doing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=126.0s)]
*  dark deeds around the world. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=130.72s)]
*  And a lot of people interpreted that as the CIA had brought home its killing machine to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=133.24s)]
*  kill President Kennedy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=139.04s)]
*  Alan Dahls flew down to Missouri to confront the aging Harry Truman at that point, said [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  you didn't mean to write this op-ed in the Washington Post, will you please retract it? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=147.92s)]
*  But he was stubborn. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=153.0s)]
*  He said, no, I did write it and I meant every word of it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=154.0s)]
*  So Alan Dahls did the next best thing, which a spymaster would do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=156.72s)]
*  He went back and changed the record. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=161.14s)]
*  He said that the op-ed piece had been written by one of Harry Truman's underlings, that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=163.2s)]
*  he didn't know what he was doing, he's quite old and so forth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=168.64s)]
*  That went into the CIA record. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=171.88s)]
*  So often Alan Dahls would change reality through the written word, through the documents, and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=173.94s)]
*  that's what he was doing or tried to do in the case of Harry Truman. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=181.64s)]
*  So yes, it was supposed to be a very limited, I think, agency in the beginning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  There was some attempt, you write, to establish congressional oversight over the agency in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=191.88s)]
*  the 1970s during the Frank Church investigation, but that was very limited. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=198.68s)]
*  And the new books that really tout that, that say the CIA has been brought to heel, are [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=205.24s)]
*  ridiculous. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=211.32s)]
*  The CIA largely does what it wants to do to this very day. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=212.32s)]
*  One of the major topics of your book, of course, is the relationship between Alan Dahls on [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=216.9s)]
*  the one hand and the CIA and JFK. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=223.78s)]
*  And you talk about the assassination of JFK and I think it was very commendable what you [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=228.1s)]
*  did, which was you treated the topic journalistically so you never went further than what the evidence [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=235.94s)]
*  permits for you to go. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=240.34s)]
*  But obviously one of the theories that people had long suspected, and I think that your [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=242.62s)]
*  book gave a lot of fuel to, was this anger that Alan Dahls felt towards JFK because of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=248.26s)]
*  the fact that JFK finally did the unthinkable, fired Alan Dahls after the debacle of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=255.34s)]
*  Bay of Pigs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=260.9s)]
*  And Alan Dahls was obviously furious that this sort of newcomer, this young president, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=261.9s)]
*  would fire Alan Dahls. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=267.02s)]
*  This person who saw the CIA as his own kind of fiefdom, what possibility or probability [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=268.54s)]
*  do you assign to the possibility that Alan Dahls was in some way involved in the assassination [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  of JFK? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=283.98s)]
*  Well, look, before I wade into those waters, I want to say this book, my book, fortunately, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=284.98s)]
*  was a New York Times bestseller despite the New York Times. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=293.42s)]
*  It was completely blacklisted, blacked out by the Washington Post, by the New York Times, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=297.06s)]
*  every major media outlet. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=302.74s)]
*  The Washington Post book editor told my publicist at a major New York publishing company, we [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=304.5s)]
*  won't touch this book with a 10-foot pole. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=310.3s)]
*  That's an exact quote. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=313.82000000000005s)]
*  Every book that I've written before that book, before The Devil's Chest Word, was reviewed [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  very favorably by the press in this country. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  So there is a reason why they wouldn't go there, because I raised issues that are impermissible, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=325.78s)]
*  that are not, that are taboo. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  And one of the taboo topics in this country, the United States, is the assassination of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  President Kennedy, which happened almost 60 years ago. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=342.53999999999996s)]
*  Still, at this late date, the media refuses to, I think, seriously consider the possibility [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=346.14s)]
*  that elements of the U.S. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=352.76000000000005s)]
*  government killed the president. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, why do I think this was organized, the killing and the cover-up by Alan Dulles? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, I have a long chapter in my book called The Power Lead. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=363.0s)]
*  Alan Dulles would never have acted on his own against the president, who he despised. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  He would, he always acted on behalf of his wealthy and powerful clients. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  And I believe that Alan Dulles was not alone in doing this, that he was backed by people who [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=379.0s)]
*  were very powerful in the national security state and on Wall Street, where he'd spent [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=385.0s)]
*  most of his career. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=390.76s)]
*  So Alan Dulles was head of the CIA, and he was, as you say, fired by President Kennedy [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=392.2s)]
*  after the disastrous invasion of Cuba in April 1961. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  He was given a medal when President Kennedy was ushered honorably out the door, but he [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=404.12s)]
*  despised the president for firing him. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=409.8s)]
*  He couldn't believe that this young, untested president had the temerity to fire someone [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=412.56s)]
*  as senior as him, someone as powerful as him. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  I believe that he turned his house in Georgetown, the neighborhood in Washington, into an [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=421.28s)]
*  anti-Kennedy operation. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  CIA, high-level CIA operatives, deputies continued to report to Alan Dulles in the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=430.24s)]
*  months and years after his firing, including James Angleton and Richard Helms, who later [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=437.36s)]
*  became head of the agency. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=443.92s)]
*  I think John McCown, who was put in charge of the agency by President Kennedy, was a [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=445.84s)]
*  figurehead. He didn't know what was going on. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=451.84s)]
*  The people who really understood how the CIA operated were still in charge. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  Alan Dulles was still in charge and his deputies. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=461.76s)]
*  Then he conveniently had himself appointed to the Warren Commission. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  This political enemy of the president was put in charge in the investigation of the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=470.32s)]
*  murder of the president. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=475.64s)]
*  This should have been, I think, spotlighted by the press, should have been debated by [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=476.96s)]
*  the press. Instead, he was seen as a wise man doing his national duty by serving on [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=481.92s)]
*  the Warren Commission after the president was killed. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  In fact, he suppressed information, vital information that would have brought the CIA [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  and the FBI into focus during the investigation. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=499.6s)]
*  He ran cover up, not a real investigation, Alan Dulles. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=505.24s)]
*  So I believe that he had the motive that he certainly had the killing machine. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=510.52s)]
*  He used the killing machine again and again to overthrow governments, to kill people [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=515.6s)]
*  overseas that he thought were opposed to U.S. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=521.0s)]
*  interests. I believe he brought that killing machine home. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=524.64s)]
*  Now, the assassination operation for the CIA was run by a guy named William Harvey, very [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=528.76s)]
*  promoted, very respected figure within the CIA. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=535.52s)]
*  And I asked for his travel records because his own deputy, he was head of the Rome station at [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=539.24s)]
*  the time President Kennedy was killed. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=545.28s)]
*  The CIA stashed him away there because Bobby Kennedy, who was attorney general at the time, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=548.04s)]
*  wanted to fire him. But they stashed him in Rome. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=553.88s)]
*  He flew, apparently, to Dallas in the weeks or days before the assassination. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  Why the hell was the Rome station chief going to Dallas when his own deputy, Mark Wyatt, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=563.0s)]
*  confronted him saying, why are you going to Dallas? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=568.48s)]
*  He said to look around. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=571.92s)]
*  I later, while I was doing my research for the book, demanded that the CIA, under the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=573.64s)]
*  Freedom of Information Act, supply Harvey's travel records. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=581.4s)]
*  They refused to release those almost 60 years later. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=585.64s)]
*  So, you know, they have something, I think, to hide. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=590.04s)]
*  They still, at this late date, are withholding thousands of documents to the CIA that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=593.36s)]
*  relate to President Kennedy's assassination and his presidency. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=598.92s)]
*  It's an outrage. These belong to the American people and they should be released. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=602.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that when I read your book, I, you know, I may have known [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=608.04s)]
*  this before, but I never really focused on it so much as when I was immersed in your [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=612.24s)]
*  book. And by the way, let me say, I wish I had read your book when it came out so that [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=615.84s)]
*  it could have been one of the voices in the media kind of countervailing this blackout [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=620.44s)]
*  because ever since I've read it, I've done nothing but sing its praises. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=624.5200000000001s)]
*  I've told people in my audience so many times, if you read one book and you want to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=627.84s)]
*  understand what the CIA is, read The Devil's Chessboard. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=632.96s)]
*  It really is, you know, I don't think you can understand the U.S. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=636.2s)]
*  security state, the CIA, the deep state, whatever you want to call it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=639.24s)]
*  Without this book, I really believe that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=642.5200000000001s)]
*  But one of the things that really amazed me was the fact that Alan Dulles ended up [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  on the Warren Commission because even back then, there was a lot of skepticism about [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  who killed JFK. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=656.76s)]
*  There was a lot of doubt and a lot of cynicism on the part of the American public about [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=657.8s)]
*  whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, whether there were powerful forces behind the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=662.28s)]
*  killing of the...to have Alan Dulles, who basically owned the CIA. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=666.44s)]
*  And as you say, even once he was fired, he still exerted immense influence within the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=672.56s)]
*  CIA. It's like when these guys leave the CIA, John Brennan and David Petraeus and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=679.76s)]
*  James Clapper, who leaves the top level that's considered, they're not really out of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=684.76s)]
*  the intelligence community. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=689.4s)]
*  They're still very much connected to it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=690.4s)]
*  The fact that he ended up on the Warren Commission by itself shows the Warren [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  Commission as a joke and a fraud. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=696.76s)]
*  How...was that a source of anger and journalistic protest at the time? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=699.16s)]
*  Or was American journalism so deferential to the U.S. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=705.48s)]
*  security state, to the kind of powers that be that they just kind of accepted Alan [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=710.4s)]
*  Dulles as you said, as this wise man whose experience would be helpful? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=714.12s)]
*  Yeah, the latter. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=720.16s)]
*  The American media. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=722.68s)]
*  John Wanner, who was publisher of the Rolling Stone, the founder of Rolling Stone [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=724.48s)]
*  magazine, was on my board at Salon. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=728.6400000000001s)]
*  And I remember a meeting with John where we hang out in his office in New York. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=731.2800000000001s)]
*  And he said to me very skeptically, oh, if there was a conspiracy to kill the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=736.0s)]
*  president, the media would have uncovered this years ago. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  Somebody would have talked. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=744.72s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=746.0s)]
*  You and I know how supine the American media is. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=747.2800000000001s)]
*  They're a lapdog. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=751.36s)]
*  And yes, they were even more so during the investigation of President Kennedy's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=752.52s)]
*  murder. Alan Dulles was friends with all these people, friends with the people [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=758.44s)]
*  man, CBS, the Paley family, friends with the Salzburgers at the New York Times. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  At the New York Times, they called him Ali. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=769.84s)]
*  He was so close to them. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=771.92s)]
*  Newsweek. I found this letter from the Newsweek editor in his own files, in [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=774.16s)]
*  Dulles' files at Princeton. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=779.72s)]
*  He was quite proud of it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=781.32s)]
*  It was a letter from the editor of Newsweek thanking Alan Dulles for shaping [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=783.6s)]
*  coverage of the Warren Report after it came out. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=788.1600000000001s)]
*  He said we had a tight deadline. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=791.0s)]
*  It was so great to have you tell us what to write, how to cover this document. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's outrageous. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  So, yes, the American media was a collaborator with the Warren Commission, not a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=800.6800000000001s)]
*  critic. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=805.7600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think there's all this debate all this time about what the political [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=806.92s)]
*  bias or the ideological bias of the American corporate media is. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=811.84s)]
*  And oftentimes people debate, is it left wing, is it right wing? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=815.04s)]
*  And I guess, you know, on certain issues, social issues and the like, you can [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=818.16s)]
*  probably trace a liberal bias. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=821.64s)]
*  Obviously, people who work in large city media outlets in New York and Washington [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=823.16s)]
*  tend to be more liberal in a sort of like very, you know, kind of like cultural way. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=828.0s)]
*  But I've always thought that the primary ideology of the American media is [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=833.0799999999999s)]
*  servitude to the U.S. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=837.52s)]
*  foreign policy community, to the CIA, to the intelligence community. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=839.68s)]
*  You go back decades and you see reports. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=842.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, here in Brazil, for example, I spent a lot of time focused on the 1964 coup [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=846.4399999999999s)]
*  that was threatened by the Kennedy administration, then the Johnson [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=851.3199999999999s)]
*  administration for the failure of Brazil's elected president to move further [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=856.0799999999999s)]
*  away from Moscow. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=861.68s)]
*  He was kind of this, you know, center left figure who was doing things like rent [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=862.7199999999999s)]
*  control and land reform. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=865.8s)]
*  And that was too much for Washington. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=867.92s)]
*  They engineered a coup working with right wing Brazilian generals, and that led to [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=869.28s)]
*  a 21 year dictatorship that the CIA supported. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=873.0799999999999s)]
*  And you go back and read Time magazine, which for kids out there used to actually [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  matter and be influential in the New York Times. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=880.16s)]
*  Invariably, they would describe these coups as revolutions against corruption or [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=882.5999999999999s)]
*  blows for democracy. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=889.8399999999999s)]
*  They would constantly describe things through the lens of the U.S. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=891.52s)]
*  security state and how they wanted to propagandize the public to see it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=896.0s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, there have been times after the rock war with the New York [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=899.84s)]
*  Times apologized for being too credulous about the things they were being fed by [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=903.48s)]
*  the intelligence community. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=909.64s)]
*  Do you think that subservient relationship between the corporate media on the one [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=910.88s)]
*  hand and the U.S. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=914.3199999999999s)]
*  government and there has gotten worse, has gotten better or more or less is what [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=915.04s)]
*  it's always been? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=918.72s)]
*  Well, I'm full of dismay as a journalist about how corrupt and how close the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=919.64s)]
*  corporate media is to the national security state. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=928.4s)]
*  You're right. Going back to President Kennedy's time, it's clear to me, I [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=933.64s)]
*  interviewed his secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, among many others. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  It was clear to me that President Kennedy would not pursue to war, expand war in [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=943.76s)]
*  Vietnam. He would have withdrawn those troops. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=949.84s)]
*  He was attempting to have a rapprochement with Castro in Cuba, with Khrushchev in [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  the Soviet Union. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=959.36s)]
*  And yes, the American media went along with him partly and partly was very [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=961.2s)]
*  critical of him. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=967.44s)]
*  And he realized that he was creating great tensions within the country, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=968.84s)]
*  including the media, as he pursued his policies of peace. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=974.24s)]
*  JFK today, unfortunately, you see it again and again. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=978.28s)]
*  The New York Times, yes, did apologize after the fact about Iraq, the invasion [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=982.76s)]
*  Iraq, which has been a complete disaster. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=988.44s)]
*  But where they did, they buried that apology on page 14, I think. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=991.84s)]
*  The Nord Stream pipeline explosion was clear to Seymour Hersh. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  It was clear to me that and other people looked into it, other journalists, that [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1000.6800000000001s)]
*  this was a CIA Ukrainian operation meant to damage the energy interests of the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1005.76s)]
*  Russia. And yet the New York Times is confounded, is mystified by this [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1012.76s)]
*  explosion. What's happening in Gaza and Israel once again, I think the one side [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1018.72s)]
*  of coverage in this country and the clam town on dissent in this country, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1024.4s)]
*  debate within the within political leaders and intellectuals and artists is [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1030.52s)]
*  frightening, I think. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1038.72s)]
*  The American media speaks of one voice on one issue after the next, particularly [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1041.16s)]
*  when it comes to wars, wars that we're involved in. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1046.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the fact that Seymour Hersh, one of the greatest journalists of, you [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1050.16s)]
*  know, the last several decades, can't get published in any major American media. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1054.76s)]
*  It speaks volumes about the not about Seymour Hersh, but about the nature of [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1060.68s)]
*  corporate media. I want to actually talk a little bit with the time I have left [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1065.28s)]
*  about the current state of the CIA and the political framework as pertains to it [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1068.36s)]
*  in terms of who's now skeptical of it and who isn't. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  But before I do, I just want to stay with the JFK thing for just a little bit [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1076.8400000000001s)]
*  longer, because you referenced earlier the fact that Alan Dulles hated JFK. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1080.04s)]
*  And of course, there are people who insist that the CIA had no role in JFK's [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1086.68s)]
*  killing because they're just kind of hacks and, you know, spokespeople for the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1091.8400000000001s)]
*  US government. But there are people who are very strong critics of the CIA, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1096.92s)]
*  people like Noam Chomsky, who have objected to the notion that there was [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1101.3999999999999s)]
*  anywhere near sufficient tension between the CIA and JFK that they would want to [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  kill him because, according to Noam Chomsky, his view, JFK was basically doing [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1111.76s)]
*  everything the CIA wanted with some exceptions. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1116.56s)]
*  I mean, he was the one who authorized the Bay of Pigs invasion, the attempts to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1119.28s)]
*  remove Fidel Castro from power. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1124.8s)]
*  He was the one who authorized the deployment of thousands of military advisors [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1127.16s)]
*  to Vietnam on the way to probably the deployment of combat troops. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1132.76s)]
*  And so his argument is, and he's generally an opponent of these kinds of theories, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1136.96s)]
*  these kind of conspiracy theories, and that's what it is, a conspiracy theory. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1141.24s)]
*  Sometimes those are true, sometimes those are false. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1144.4s)]
*  I don't see that as derogatory. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1146.2s)]
*  But his argument is there was no real reason for the CIA to look at JFK as an [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1148.0s)]
*  impediment to what they wanted to do. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1153.0800000000002s)]
*  How do you see that question? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1155.32s)]
*  Well, he's wrong. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1158.56s)]
*  I have great respect for Noam Chomsky as well, but unfortunately, some of the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1160.36s)]
*  leading lights of the American left are absolutely wrong about the Kennedy [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  presidency and what it meant to American history. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1169.04s)]
*  I did the research. I interviewed all the people who are still living, who are [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1172.08s)]
*  involved in the Kennedy presidency and who are around the Kennedy presidency. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1176.28s)]
*  And I came to a very different conclusion. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1180.68s)]
*  JFK was breaking with Cold War orthodoxy. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1183.4s)]
*  That's what got him killed. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1186.4s)]
*  It's very clear to me as a historian journalist who's done the work that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1187.96s)]
*  that's what happened. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1191.96s)]
*  He broke from the generals. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1193.2s)]
*  He broke from the CIA, as I said earlier, to establish peace, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1194.8000000000002s)]
*  détente with the Soviet Union. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1199.3200000000002s)]
*  He was very afraid of accidental nuclear war breaking out. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1201.2s)]
*  He himself was a student of history as a young boy. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1205.2s)]
*  He had read about World War I and what a calamity that was. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1208.4s)]
*  He thought it would be even worse, a nuclear war, if we were plunged into one. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1212.28s)]
*  He was dead set at establishing peace. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1217.32s)]
*  All you have to do is listen to his peace speech that he delivered in June of 1963. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1221.08s)]
*  I think it sealed his fate at American University. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1226.72s)]
*  And what he said that we should actually empathize with the Soviet people, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1230.0s)]
*  with the Russian people. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1235.24s)]
*  At the height of the Cold War, he's telling us, the American people, to [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1236.6s)]
*  empathize with our enemies. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1239.96s)]
*  I think that's what got him killed, that kind of attitude. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1242.12s)]
*  Again and again, Kennedy was intent on peace, withdrawing troops in Vietnam, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1245.12s)]
*  establishing peace in Cuba, which is a Cold War hotspot at the time, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1250.52s)]
*  and with the Soviet Union. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1255.28s)]
*  And I think because of that, because he was endangering the racket. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1256.84s)]
*  And let's face it, they make a lot, a lot of money. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1260.6s)]
*  The military industrial complex. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  You can see how their profits have gone soaring and their stocks because the wars [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1265.6399999999999s)]
*  in the Middle East and Ukraine is disgusting. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1270.96s)]
*  It's blood money. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1274.44s)]
*  And so billions of dollars are at stake. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1275.52s)]
*  And when JFK threatened that and to break from Cold War [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1278.84s)]
*  orthodoxy, he was threatening the racket, too. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1284.08s)]
*  And that's why they killed him. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1286.84s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think and I have my difference of the Chomsky, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1288.24s)]
*  including on this, I think sometimes what gets overlooked is maybe [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1292.3999999999999s)]
*  JFK didn't usher in a revolution. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1297.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, there was a continuity, but even minor attempts to resist the CIA, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1300.44s)]
*  especially after eight years of Dwight Eisenhower, who, as you said, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1305.88s)]
*  basically gave foreign policy to the Dulles brothers, would be seen as a [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1308.96s)]
*  reason for being that angry. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1315.1200000000001s)]
*  I had RFK Jr. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1317.72s)]
*  on my show and one of the arguments he made about why the CIA and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1319.3200000000002s)]
*  the Dulles part of the sort of shadow government hated JFK so much. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1325.72s)]
*  And this is an argument, I think one of the strongest to support this view was [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1332.08s)]
*  that he did eventually he did originally authorize the deployment of military [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1335.96s)]
*  advisors, but when he began to see how many there were and how many were being [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1340.04s)]
*  killed and how many were in danger, he realized that it had been a major [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1344.4s)]
*  mistake and he was ready to sign a deployment order requiring the withdraw [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1348.04s)]
*  of those military advisors that ended up not happening because he was killed. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1352.1599999999999s)]
*  And then LBJ gets inaugurated. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1356.08s)]
*  And before you know it, you have the Gulf of Tonkin incident and the Senate's [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1357.8s)]
*  authorizing the deployment of actual combat troops. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1361.2s)]
*  And then you have the Vietnam War. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1363.48s)]
*  Do you think that's a fairly accurate [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1365.12s)]
*  description of what JFK was doing with regard to the Vietnam War? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1368.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he was appalled by the killing. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1373.84s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1376.1599999999999s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Jr. has a right. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1377.08s)]
*  You know, I just spent the last two years [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1379.72s)]
*  investigating Kennedy's policy in Vietnam with Oliver Stone because I wrote this [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1382.16s)]
*  screenplay for Oliver, which I hope is made into a Hollywood movie now. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1387.8s)]
*  And so we both investigate this quite deeply. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1392.36s)]
*  And of course, Oliver Stone has a big stake in Vietnam. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1395.2s)]
*  He was there as a soldier. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1398.4s)]
*  He got wounded. He killed people. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1400.08s)]
*  He's not proud of that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1403.08s)]
*  He did the movie JFK. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1404.56s)]
*  He's very invested in this subject. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1406.76s)]
*  And he's done a lot of reading and thinking about it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1409.28s)]
*  So between the two of us, I think we came to the right conclusion. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1411.72s)]
*  Kennedy was withdrawing from Vietnam. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1415.96s)]
*  He intended to withdraw after he was safely reelected in 64. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1418.24s)]
*  He didn't believe that it was a winnable war. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1422.44s)]
*  Douglas MacArthur, the general, had warned him not to get involved in a land war. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1425.96s)]
*  And in Asia, he didn't want to do that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1430.8s)]
*  He didn't want another Korea. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1433.3999999999999s)]
*  It was quite clear from talking to McNamara as Secretary of Defense and others [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1435.48s)]
*  that that's what he did intended to do. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1440.76s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy, by the way, you brought him up, Bobby Kennedy, Jr. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1444.32s)]
*  I met with Bobby some 20 years ago and I told him that it would be remarkable if he [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1448.3999999999999s)]
*  looked into the assassination of his father and his uncle. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1455.8799999999999s)]
*  He looked down his plate. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1460.16s)]
*  I met with him at the Parker House Hotel [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1461.6399999999999s)]
*  in Boston 20 years ago, and he said we, meaning his generation, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1463.72s)]
*  were always taught to look forward, not back. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1468.5600000000002s)]
*  He refused to go there to the dark side and who killed his uncle and father. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1471.0800000000002s)]
*  He did with I think in the later years because of my book and others, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1478.5600000000002s)]
*  he did what was necessary. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1484.0s)]
*  I have a lot of respect for his commitment to finding the truth. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1486.0800000000002s)]
*  Commitment, unfortunately, I shared by most of his family. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1492.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I had him on and I definitely disagreed with some of his positions, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1496.44s)]
*  including on Israel, but I walked away thinking he was one of the most kind [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1503.0800000000002s)]
*  of open minded and earnest people I've ever encountered in terms of being [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1507.2s)]
*  a political candidate on that level, somebody very willing to kind of change [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1512.0800000000002s)]
*  their mind, to rethink their foundational views. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1515.16s)]
*  And obviously, growing up as a member [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1517.8000000000002s)]
*  of the Kennedy family and being so entrenched in the Democratic Party, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1519.2s)]
*  they were kind of, as you said, taught not to question those things. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1522.76s)]
*  And he finally is. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1525.64s)]
*  And that has alienated from his family. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mcqa9BMPE&t=1527.04s)]
