# Iranian Professor: Israel's Regime Has Destroyed Itself
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw)
*  Let me ask you about Iran vis-a-vis the region. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=0.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people, including people who are not bought into this caricature of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=11.6s)]
*  Iran, this cartoon version of Iran about being this apocalyptic cult or whatever, a lot of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=16.48s)]
*  people have come to believe, and it might even be one of them, that the events of the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=24.2s)]
*  last, say, six months to a year has actually weakened Iran in terms of its ability to oppose [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=29.84s)]
*  both the United States and Israel and Western powers in general through the Israeli attack, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  the bombing attack on Iran and retaliation for the missile strikes, which were in retaliation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=41.08s)]
*  the Iranian consulate in Damascus, that that weakened or destroyed Iranian air defenses, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=47.16s)]
*  including around its nuclear facilities, the forced removal of Bashar al-Assad, who had [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=56.08s)]
*  been an ally of Iran in Syria and has put, empowered people who are far more sympathetic [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=61.44s)]
*  to the United States and Israel, at least willing to do business with them, and much [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=66.44s)]
*  less so with Iran, as well as the weakening of Hezbollah, the killing of its very charismatic [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=69.5s)]
*  and true leader, has, in a lot of ways, made Iran a less formidable figure in terms of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=74.84s)]
*  leading this so-called axis of resistance. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=83.4s)]
*  Do you think there's validity to that view? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=86.08s)]
*  I would disagree, and for a number of reasons. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  One is that without a doubt, in war, all sides are weakened. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Without a doubt, even though the Russians are winning the war, but the Russians are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=100.28s)]
*  weakened. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=105.56s)]
*  They have to spend money, they lose men, they lose equipment, and the Ukrainians, of course, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=106.56s)]
*  are severely weakened, but so is Europe, so is the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=113.92s)]
*  The war in Iraq and Afghanistan cost, was like six, seven, eight, nine trillion dollars. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=117.16s)]
*  That's how much money was spent directly or indirectly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  I would assume that in Ukraine, indirectly, forget the direct support, that's just one [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=128.04s)]
*  part of it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=134.4s)]
*  The indirect cost of the war in Ukraine will be in many trillions of dollars, the sanctions, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=135.4s)]
*  and so on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  But that doesn't mean the weakness comes from one side. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  I personally think that the biggest loser in this war, by far, is the Israeli regime. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  Because for many decades, the Israeli regime has promoted itself as a democracy, as representative [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  of the West, and of course, the West, as we were discussing earlier, presents itself as [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  the supporters of human rights and human values and all that is good in this world. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=166.96s)]
*  But now the regime has destroyed itself. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=172.8s)]
*  Its image across the world is in the mud. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=176.2s)]
*  No one sees it as legitimate outside the West, or maybe in some parts of India, but across [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  the global majority or the global South, and even in much of the West, people view it completely [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=186.16s)]
*  in a completely different light than before. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  They can no longer hide behind the Holocaust in Europe. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=195.72s)]
*  They can no longer hide behind the word anti-Semitism, regardless of what that exactly means and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=199.76s)]
*  the fact that Palestinians are Seminites themselves, and more Seminite probably than the bulk of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=206.68s)]
*  the immigrant population that came from Europe and elsewhere to Palestine. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=211.48s)]
*  So in my opinion, regardless of the economic hardship that the Israeli regime has imposed [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=218.32s)]
*  upon its own population and the other problems, I think that this was the most important outcome [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=224.76s)]
*  of the war so far. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=231.32s)]
*  This Holocaust, this genocide is something that the world will not forgive, and this [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=233.4s)]
*  will have a very, very important influence on the way politics play out with regards [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=237.6s)]
*  to Syria, because I think that the Israelis failed in Lebanon. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  The fact that they could not take southern Lebanon, regardless of the fact that they [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  martyred Sayed Hassan Nasrallah and others. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=253.6s)]
*  The fact that they could not take Gaza either means that they failed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=257.96s)]
*  Just today, I think they lost three of their soldiers in Gaza. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=263.76s)]
*  So in the past, when the Israelis would attack Egypt, they'd go all the way to the Suez Canal. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=267.64s)]
*  But now after 15 months, their sticks still stuck in Gaza. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=273.96s)]
*  In 1982, when they invaded Lebanon, they went all the way to Beirut within days. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=278.76s)]
*  Now we see that they were unable to make any significant inroads. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=283.32s)]
*  The only place where one could argue that the Israeli regime achieved a success is in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=288.0s)]
*  Syria. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=295.28s)]
*  But there, I would also disagree. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=296.88s)]
*  Many in Iran, ordinary people and across the world, would consider this a victory for this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=299.11999999999995s)]
*  coalition between Erdogan, Netanyahu and Biden. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  But I personally think that the winner in all this, and again, putting aside the misery [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  that's being imposed upon ordinary Syrians, the fact that the US and Erdogan and Netanyahu [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=317.12s)]
*  imposed Al-Qaeda and its affiliates on the Syrian people, that aside, I think that this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  worked to Iran's advantage, because the Iranians entered Syria in 2013. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=332.16s)]
*  After tens of thousands of foreign fighters were brought into the country to bring down [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=339.48s)]
*  the Syrian government. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=343.4s)]
*  And the only reason why the Iranians entered was because they did not want the black flags [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=346.12s)]
*  of ISIS and Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda over Damascus or Baghdad. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=349.88s)]
*  And remember, Baghdad was also about to fall and Lebanon was also in serious trouble. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=354.88s)]
*  So the Iranians entered in 2013 and so did Hezbollah to push them back because NATO was [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=360.76s)]
*  behind it. Of course, Erdogan was behind ISIS and Al-Qaeda. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=367.0s)]
*  And so were the countries in the Persian Gulf region. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=371.12s)]
*  And I think many of them weren't even thinking about the consequences of ISIS in their [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=374.36s)]
*  obsession to defeat Syria because of its relationship with Hezbollah and Iran, that they [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=380.16s)]
*  weren't even thinking about the consequences that it had for themselves. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=386.68s)]
*  But over the last three, four years, Syria has become a burden for Iran. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  Every year, Iran has been giving them huge amounts of free oil. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=397.8s)]
*  They've also been funding them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=403.76s)]
*  And I think it's maybe I don't know the real number, but a huge amount of money. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=405.56s)]
*  Now the Iranians don't have to do that anymore. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=411.2s)]
*  And this quagmire is going to be something that Mr. Erdogan and Qatar and others are [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=413.44s)]
*  going to have to deal with. The economy in Syria, thanks to this dirty war on the country [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=420.48s)]
*  by NATO and its allies, has reduced the country to 15 percent of the of the economy that it [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=425.32s)]
*  had in 2010. And the country is in ruins. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=431.76s)]
*  The United States is occupying one part of the country. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=435.56s)]
*  The Israeli regime is moving forward. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  Even today, they've made more further advances in the South. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=439.6s)]
*  And right now there's a shortage of fuel. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=443.32s)]
*  There's a shortage of bread and and the country is in big trouble. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=446.08s)]
*  And it's and this extremist organization, which is being backed. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=452.12s)]
*  And right now we see the Western media describing Jolani and his people sort of like [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=456.2s)]
*  the Pahlavi's, like the good guys. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=462.28s)]
*  You know, this guy was a deputy of ISIS. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=464.96s)]
*  He was the head of Al Qaeda in Syria a decade after 9-11, less than a decade after [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  the 7-7 bombings in London, less than a decade, I think, after the Manchester bombing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=476.2s)]
*  So you see this person in power. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=484.64s)]
*  You see him and his group and the groups allied to him hostile towards all the minorities, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=487.68s)]
*  the Kurds and the bulk of the Sunni population as well. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=494.6s)]
*  It's not as if they support him and his allies themselves are some of them are far more [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  far more extreme than he is. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=505.32s)]
*  So how exactly is Mr. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  Erdogan going to be able to manage this? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=509.4s)]
*  These terror organizations remains to be seen. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=512.56s)]
*  But I think this is the problems that Syria is going to cause for Egypt, for Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=515.6s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has distanced itself from this Wahhabi extremism over the past few years. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=521.24s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman is moving in a different direction. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=526.56s)]
*  I don't want to we can discuss that at another time. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=530.16s)]
*  But now Erdogan has taken control of these extremist groups. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  Is that something that Saudi Arabia welcomes? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=539.24s)]
*  Is that something that Jordan welcomes or Egypt? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=541.76s)]
*  This can be a destabilizing factor for the American camp in the region. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=544.52s)]
*  And so the Iran's costs, Iran no longer has the burden of Syria and those countries that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=550.28s)]
*  have destroyed Syria through their dirty work, they have to now pay the price. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=555.64s)]
*  So I'm not quite sure that these people have weakened Iran. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=559.28s)]
*  I think in the in the long run, they're going to be the losers. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=564.52s)]
*  And I don't think Joe Lani is going to last all that long. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=567.92s)]
*  So I definitely get all of that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=572.0s)]
*  And I think the United States learned the lesson, although these lessons got learned and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=573.6s)]
*  then unlearned very quickly when it's time for a new war that if you go and create [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=576.64s)]
*  instability somewhere or a vacuum of power, very unpredictable results can happen. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=580.08s)]
*  It was the invasion of Iraq, even according to Tony Blair, the removal of Saddam Hussein, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=584.92s)]
*  that created the conditions in which ISIS emerged in the Middle East. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=588.44s)]
*  At least that's what a lot of Westerners, including those who supported the invasion [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  of Iraq, now believe. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  And so who knows what will emerge out of the mess in Syria? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=599.8800000000001s)]
*  And I absolutely understand the reasons why this has become a huge problem for a lot of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  actors, including those who promoted it, including Turkey and arguably Israel. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=607.6400000000001s)]
*  But there was Netanyahu not just celebrating the removal of Assad, but essentially taking [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  credit for it, talking about the role that the Israelis played in liberating the Syrian [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=618.32s)]
*  people and all that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  So they have clearly made the calculation that this is in their interest, despite the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=623.36s)]
*  risks and dangers that you're identifying. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons why it seems almost valid for the Israelis to see it that [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=631.2s)]
*  way is because Syria had been crucial to the Iranians' ability to work with and arm Hezbollah, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  even to some extent the Palestinians, and with Syria now no longer being a country that's [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=644.4s)]
*  allied with Iran and that Iran can use for that refueling of Hezbollah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=650.16s)]
*  The idea, at least from the Israeli perspective and therefore the American perspective, is [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  that one of the losers in all of this is Iran. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=658.56s)]
*  Why isn't that part true? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=661.6s)]
*  Well, there are two parts here that I should point out, two issues. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=665.36s)]
*  One is that, in my opinion, Netanyahu is working in the interest of Netanyahu and not the Israeli [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=670.64s)]
*  regime. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=679.52s)]
*  Just like I believe that Erdogan is working in the interest of Erdogan and not in the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=681.12s)]
*  interest of the people of Turkey or Turkey, because I believe that this adventure in Syria [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=685.84s)]
*  is not going to do good for the people of Turkey. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=693.52s)]
*  I think that the policies over the past 15 months that the Israeli regime has carried [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=697.0s)]
*  out is not going to end well for the regime. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=702.08s)]
*  If the regime was smart, and again, I apologize for this sort of language, they would have [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=704.92s)]
*  carried out the genocide from October the 8th for a month or two and lied about the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=710.56s)]
*  beheadings and lied about the rapes. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=717.0s)]
*  A lot of global public opinion would have been with them because Western media has been [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=720.56s)]
*  so powerful. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=724.92s)]
*  But he went on, and then he should have declared a ceasefire and said, I defeated Hamas, I [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=726.36s)]
*  punished them, and Islamic Jihad, and I won. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=731.92s)]
*  He would have had everyone on his side, or a lot of people. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=735.28s)]
*  The longer the genocide continued, the more people began to explore the history of Palestine. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=740.12s)]
*  They learned about the Nekba, and they learned about what happened to the Palestinian people. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=749.16s)]
*  The more they went forward, the more scenes of misery and death and destruction and genocide [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=754.16s)]
*  was being viewed by people across the world. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  An Israeli regime became despised across the world. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=763.8399999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu, he stayed in power, and I think that's what his objective was and continues [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=767.68s)]
*  to be. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=773.0s)]
*  But Israel has been destroyed. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  If Netanyahu celebrates, and many Israelis would celebrate with him, that doesn't necessarily [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=776.48s)]
*  mean it's good policy for the regime. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=783.24s)]
*  But what I would say about Syria is that Syria distanced itself from Iran a few years ago. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=787.24s)]
*  And President Assad, or former President Assad, he began to approach Saudi Arabia and the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=795.8399999999999s)]
*  Emirates. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=802.52s)]
*  He expelled the bulk of the Iranians who were there to fight against ISIS and al-Qaeda. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=803.52s)]
*  Three or four years ago. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=813.28s)]
*  And he tilted away. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=815.4s)]
*  And Hezbollah and Iran had great difficulty in really using the facilities that they once [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=817.12s)]
*  used in Syria over the past few years. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=825.36s)]
*  And we saw that during this war, this genocide, these genocidal attacks by Israel on Lebanon. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  We saw that Hezbollah was unable to use the assets that existed in Syria, and that the [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=834.96s)]
*  Syrian government had tilted away. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=841.88s)]
*  I'm not saying that they sided with the Israelis or that they worked against Hezbollah, but [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=845.08s)]
*  there is evidence that elements within Syrian intelligence, and I don't know how far it [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=851.4399999999999s)]
*  goes up, that they were giving information to the Israeli regime about Iranian or Hezbollah [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=857.6s)]
*  related assets. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=868.16s)]
*  And the Israelis were bombing them over the past few years. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=872.16s)]
*  So while Syria obviously did not have the negative role that Turkey had, I mean, Mr. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=876.84s)]
*  Erdogan has been selling oil, transporting oil from Baku for the last 15 months, helping [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=885.48s)]
*  to fuel the war machine in Israel to carry out the genocide. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=892.82s)]
*  Sisi has been doing business as usual. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=898.7800000000001s)]
*  He's also been helping the Israelis use their ports because the Red Sea was close to the [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=901.14s)]
*  Israeli regime. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=907.1800000000001s)]
*  And Jordan and the Emirates, they've all been helping the regime. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=909.3000000000001s)]
*  He wasn't doing that, but he was definitely not... [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=913.62s)]
*  Syria under Assad did not have the sort of relationship with Iran over the past four [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=918.4200000000001s)]
*  years than they did in the past. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=924.1800000000001s)]
*  So I think that increasingly, especially over the last three years, the Syrian government [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=927.54s)]
*  has been a burden to Iran. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=934.86s)]
*  And we have to always remember, Iran was...it's not that Iran was ever a fan of the Syrian [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=936.54s)]
*  government. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=943.38s)]
*  It's a Ba'athist regime. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=945.54s)]
*  And remember, Iran fought against Saddam Hussein, who led another faction of the Ba'athist [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=946.5799999999999s)]
*  party. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=951.5s)]
*  But for Iran, Syria under President Assad or former President Assad was infinitely better [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=952.86s)]
*  than ISIS and al-Qaeda. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=960.62s)]
*  And that continues to be the belief today that ISIS and al-Qaeda are not good for Syria, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=962.8199999999999s)]
*  they're not good for the region, and they're not good for the war. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=968.54s)]
*  And what has happened in Syria is going to have consequences. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=971.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think even Mr. Erdogan is underestimating the anger that exists in China, in Russia, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=974.74s)]
*  in Central Asia when they see these many thousands of extremists armed and trained by Turkish [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=981.6600000000001s)]
*  intelligence fighting in Syria, and also some of them calling for jihad, as they call it, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=989.5400000000001s)]
*  in their own countries. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=998.7800000000001s)]
*  And by the way, just one thing that I would like to add. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1000.54s)]
*  These extremist groups, as you know, and I'm sure many in your audience know, they were [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1003.3s)]
*  created by the West. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1008.02s)]
*  It began in Afghanistan. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1010.5s)]
*  I don't want to go into history. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1011.5s)]
*  Their first textbooks, their first textbooks that were printed for children to use in Afghanistan [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1013.8199999999999s)]
*  were published with USAID money and at the University of Nebraska. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1023.42s)]
*  So this is American Islam, or this was Saudi Islam. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1031.78s)]
*  Again, Saudi Arabia has distanced itself from these people. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1038.58s)]
*  But this is not an indigenous Islam to this region. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1041.18s)]
*  These are groups that the United States and its allies created, and they've destroyed [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1048.54s)]
*  so much of our region. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1054.1399999999999s)]
*  And another thing is that it's these groups that the West created and that the Israelis [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1055.82s)]
*  have also been supporting that together have destroyed so much of our region and led to [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1059.98s)]
*  millions of people to flee to Europe. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1064.86s)]
*  So those people in Europe who are so angry about immigration, they should look to people [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1067.98s)]
*  And they should look to people in Washington and European capitals that have been funding [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1074.22s)]
*  these extremists that have ultimately together led to so many people leaving the region. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1079.5s)]
*  Otherwise, I think many of the people who are living in Europe would have preferred [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1084.94s)]
*  to stay at home. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1087.98s)]
*  But when your homes are destroyed, you have to go somewhere safe. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1088.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing always when I see Americans seeing for the first time American media accounts [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1092.5s)]
*  talking about Osama bin Laden with headlines like anti-communist warrior or anti-Soviet [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1099.94s)]
*  fighter is heralded as the future of Afghanistan. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1106.98s)]
*  And people become very confused at how this satanic figure was once celebrated in Washington, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1110.7s)]
*  similar to the way that Jelani was once talked about the way Osama bin Laden now is and has [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1116.1000000000001s)]
*  stopped at a kind of reverse conversion. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bcJLA0E7Kw&t=1119.42s)]
