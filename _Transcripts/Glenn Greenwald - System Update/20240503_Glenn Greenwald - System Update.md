# INTERVIEW: David Sirota on Corporate Control of DC, Boeing Revelations
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8)
*  David Sirota has worked in journalism, politics, and the entertainment industry for many years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=0.0s)]
*  He has previously worked for the independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=11.68s)]
*  Both when Sanders was a House member and then as a presidential candidate. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=15.76s)]
*  He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his work co-writing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=19.68s)]
*  the 2022 Netflix film Don't Look Up. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=25.16s)]
*  Sirota founded the Lever News back in 2020. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=28.6s)]
*  It was under a different name at the time and it is a reader-supported site that specializes [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  in original investigative reporting that follows the influence of corporate money in Washington. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  It is subscriber and reader dependent and yet has grown to employ 19 reporters and editors. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Sirota just launched a new podcast called Lever Time as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=47.36s)]
*  We will talk to him about all of that as well as recent reporting he has done on how airline-funded [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=51.56s)]
*  members of Congress are trying to block critical consumer reforms as well as some of the problems [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=56.24s)]
*  inside Boeing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=61.28s)]
*  We are always delighted to have someone who is doing so well kind of being an exemplary [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=62.82s)]
*  figure of what independent media can achieve. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=67.6s)]
*  David, good evening. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=70.56s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=71.84s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=72.84s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me, Glenn. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=73.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=76.08s)]
*  So before we get to these individual stories, which I absolutely want to focus and spend [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=77.08s)]
*  the bulk of our time on, let's talk about the Lever because obviously independent media [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=81.2s)]
*  and independent journalism is a major focus of mine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=87.16s)]
*  It's something that I believe is absolutely critical for our country, the ability to do [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=90.16s)]
*  real reporting, not just punditry, without relying on major media corporations and all [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=94.12s)]
*  the constraints that they have. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=99.48s)]
*  So just talk a little bit about the origin story of the Lever and how it's grown into [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=101.4s)]
*  this kind of behemoth that's really breaking some significant stories. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=106.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I was working on Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, as you mentioned, and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=110.2s)]
*  after the campaign I wanted to go back to journalism. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=115.28s)]
*  I had taken a hiatus from journalism when I worked on Bernie's campaign, and I wanted [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  to start an independent media outlet that focused on money at the center of it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=123.32s)]
*  By that I mean following the money. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=129.24s)]
*  Our stories, if you read them at levernews.com, you'll see almost all of them have money and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=131.62s)]
*  corporate power at the center. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=136.88s)]
*  And the reason a reader-supported entity, I think, is necessary for that is because [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=138.78s)]
*  a reader-supported entity gives you a foundation that's sustainable to report on power and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=145.34s)]
*  money. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=153.94s)]
*  Power and money doesn't usually fund adversarial investigative reporting about power and money. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=155.1s)]
*  So that's why our model exists the way it is, and I think the stories we're going to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=161.78s)]
*  discuss will illustrate the kinds of stories that we do and that in a lot of ways other [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=165.62s)]
*  corporate media doesn't do. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=172.7s)]
*  Yeah, and I think a lot of times, too, there's a perception in independent journalism and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=175.46s)]
*  independent media, often true, that the easiest way to succeed and to develop a very enthusiastic [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  subscriber base is if you kind of plant your flag in one political party or the other or [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=186.46s)]
*  on one side of the ideological spectrum or the other and just kind of feed people the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=191.54s)]
*  validating claims that they want to have. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=195.34s)]
*  Your site, I think, above all, avoids that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=197.46s)]
*  You are very bipartisan in the targets. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=200.46s)]
*  And one of the stories that you actually broke and had a major impact on in terms of debates [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=203.5s)]
*  in Washington and on various news networks is the story about the attempt by some people [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=208.54s)]
*  in Washington to reform the airlines industry, one of the worst industries to have to deal [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=214.8s)]
*  with. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  I know personally I do everything possible to avoid domestic flying inside of the United [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  States because of how miserable it is, how abused you are, how impossible it is to even [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  be treated like a human. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=228.96s)]
*  So there's now some reform that's being proposed, and yet there are members of Congress who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=230.74s)]
*  like to posture as populists but who receive massive donations from the airline industry [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=235.08s)]
*  who are now blocking it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  So this is what you've been doing is tracing this money, tracing the way in which these [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  people are trying to block these consumer and passenger friendly reforms. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=246.32s)]
*  Talk about what these reforms are and how they're being blocked. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=249.48s)]
*  Yeah, so this story, and you're right, it does deal with both parties. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  This story starts, I think, way back in the 2022 Southwest Airlines debacle where Southwest [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=256.86s)]
*  Airlines went down during the holidays, its software went down. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=263.28s)]
*  Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the Biden administration Department of Transportation secretary, had [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=268.46s)]
*  been warned that he needed to get tougher with airlines in the lead up to this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=273.38s)]
*  He sort of ignored those warnings and he got rightfully so, and we broke that story way [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=278.7s)]
*  back then, he got a lot of scrutiny and a lot of criticism and a lot of pressure to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=283.74s)]
*  actually do his job. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=288.38s)]
*  And for a while he kind of pretended like he didn't have any power to deal with the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=290.28s)]
*  airlines. But after enough pressure and scrutiny, guess what? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=294.1s)]
*  He does have power to actually crack down on airlines. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  And so he ended up, in my view, doing the right thing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=300.54s)]
*  He put forward a rule that says it's kind of amazing that it hadn't been on the books [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=303.74s)]
*  before that. But that basically said, listen, if you if your flight gets canceled or [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=309.48s)]
*  significantly delayed, the airlines have to automatically refund you your money and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  let's underscore automatically. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=320.74s)]
*  So the Biden administration put that rule out about a week and a half ago. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=323.02s)]
*  And I think we should say that electioneers tend to foster these kinds of policies because [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=326.62s)]
*  there is an election in about six months and giving consumers and passengers something [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=332.46s)]
*  that they deserve, I think, is more likely an election year. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=336.74s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=339.78s)]
*  100 percent, 100 percent. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=341.38s)]
*  And this seems like common sense, right? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=342.82s)]
*  If the airlines don't render you a service, they have to immediately automatically give [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=344.5s)]
*  you your money back. A lot of celebratory headlines. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=349.5s)]
*  And then about a week later, we broke the story that in a a must pass aviation bill [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  dealing with the FAA, the Oversight Agency, forced lawmakers among four of the six top [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  recipients of airline industry money inserted a line into this massive bill that that if [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=368.5s)]
*  you read the bill, you might not even notice it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=374.74s)]
*  But it was eight words that basically says the passenger whose flight was canceled or [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=377.06s)]
*  significantly delayed can get a refund upon request of the airline carrier. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  Now, this seems like a small little detail, but to my mind and to the Biden [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=391.62s)]
*  administration's mind, it is everything. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=397.62s)]
*  I mean, the Biden administration, when they announced their rule, it's they talked a lot [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=400.14000000000004s)]
*  about how it would avoid forcing customers into the cumbersome Kafkaesque process [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=405.18s)]
*  of trying to get a refund. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=412.66s)]
*  So here's what ultimately happened. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=414.74s)]
*  Here's what really happened. The airlines gave a lot of money to these four lawmakers. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=416.62s)]
*  The Department of Transportation put out its rule, asked these lawmakers to enshrine [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=421.1s)]
*  the Biden administration rule in law. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=426.42s)]
*  Those lawmakers ignored that request and put eight words into this giant bill that puts [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=429.06s)]
*  the onus back on passengers to request the refunds. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=434.82s)]
*  Now, why would the lawmakers do that? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=438.18s)]
*  Why would the airline lobbyists want that? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=440.62s)]
*  Well, because as we know from the past, during the pandemic, the airlines sat on 10 [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  billion, that's billion with a B, 10 billion dollars of unpaid refunds and travel [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=448.78s)]
*  credits. So the airlines know that the harder they make it for you to get a refund back, a [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=455.53999999999996s)]
*  refund that you are owed, the more red tape, the more cumbersome a process, the fewer [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=462.1s)]
*  refunds they will have to pay because they know that the harder the process is, the more [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=466.86s)]
*  it will deter some subset of the population that's owed money from actually going through [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=471.7s)]
*  the process of requesting the money. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=476.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it sounds in the abstract in kind of theory like it's not that big or [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=478.58s)]
*  burdensome of a requirement. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=483.86s)]
*  Oh, all you have to do is ask. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=485.7s)]
*  But of course, as you say, it's like dealing with health insurance companies or any [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=487.46s)]
*  insurance companies, the request ends up being something that requires hours of your [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=491.14s)]
*  time. If you want to call because something has gone wrong, you wait on hold for an hour. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=497.62s)]
*  You often get disconnected. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  They're extremely rude. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  They make it as difficult as possible, not necessarily when you want to buy a ticket, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=504.9s)]
*  but when you want something that is yours to get. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  Now, I saw Ted Cruz being interviewed on CNBC because I believe he I don't know if he's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=512.98s)]
*  one of the four people that you mentioned. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=519.1s)]
*  I want to ask you, who are you? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=520.62s)]
*  OK, so he's one of the people being funded by the airline industry and has proposed, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=521.9s)]
*  advocated this change that would basically gut the entire reform. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=527.86s)]
*  And his argument was, look, it's actually not good for the passenger, for the consumer to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=531.38s)]
*  automatically refund their ticket, because a lot of times when people's flight gets [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=538.02s)]
*  canceled, they don't want to refund. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=541.46s)]
*  They just want to go on the next flight. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=543.22s)]
*  And by forcing them into a refund, you're basically preventing them from doing what [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=544.78s)]
*  they want, which is just going on a flight, which is why the better solution is to only [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=549.78s)]
*  give refunds to people who say that they want them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=553.98s)]
*  What's your answer to that? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=556.1s)]
*  Well, the answer to that is that that's just fundamentally false. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=558.22s)]
*  That's that's just not actually true in any way. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=561.1s)]
*  The way that the rule was written was they have to offer to rebook you. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=564.22s)]
*  And if you say no to a rebooking, they have to immediately give you your money back. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=569.66s)]
*  So the notion that getting an automatic refund or at least having the responsibility [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=574.14s)]
*  for an automatic refund on the airline somehow will harm travelers is just a lot of nonsense. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=579.62s)]
*  It's a lot of of of distraction. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=585.86s)]
*  And look, the reason is because to my mind, in my view, is that Ted Cruz is running for [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=588.26s)]
*  reelection in Texas. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=593.3s)]
*  He's getting some scrutiny and pressure and and public criticism for this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=594.74s)]
*  And he wants to have a rationale to say why he did it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=600.7s)]
*  He can't just come out and say, I did it because my airline funders asked me to make it harder [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=603.86s)]
*  for my constituents to get refunds. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=609.66s)]
*  He can't just come out and admit that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=612.1s)]
*  So he's got to come up with a rationale for it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=613.74s)]
*  Yeah. And all these people run on a platform, you know, Republicans and Democrats now of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=616.26s)]
*  standing up to big corporations and trying to protect the little guy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=622.26s)]
*  And this is the kind of thing that actually happens in Washington is behind the scenes. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  This is how the legislation gets written. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=629.8199999999999s)]
*  And a lot of time it's done in a way not to be noticed. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=631.82s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things that's so important about your reporting, by the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=634.94s)]
*  way. So Ted Cruz is one of the four who are at this. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=637.58s)]
*  I think I saw something in one of your articles that Senator Maria Cantwell, the Democrat [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=640.54s)]
*  from Washington, is as well. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=646.82s)]
*  Is she one of the four and who else is is leading this? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=648.38s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, it's the it's the four members, the two members of the House, two members of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=650.82s)]
*  the Senate who oversee the transportation committees. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=654.98s)]
*  And that is Chairwoman Senator Maria Cantwell. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=657.78s)]
*  Ted Cruz is the ranking member, a Republican on the on the committee. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=661.42s)]
*  And then in the House, it's Congressman Sam Graves from Missouri, a Republican, and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=664.86s)]
*  Congressman Rick Larson from Washington. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=669.26s)]
*  So I just want to shift gears a little bit to something else that's been going on in [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=672.9399999999999s)]
*  the airline industry, which is the very serious and alarming problems that Boeing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=678.5s)]
*  aircraft have had near catastrophes with Alaska Airlines. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=684.62s)]
*  I think a lot of people who question whether or not there's too much federal regulation [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=689.5400000000001s)]
*  and too much intrusion into the free market think that there is some legitimate functions [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=694.9000000000001s)]
*  for government. Making sure planes are safe would be one, making sure medications are [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=700.86s)]
*  safe is another. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=704.6600000000001s)]
*  And yet it seems like there were these massive oversights that basically Boeing was just [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=706.46s)]
*  left to their own devices. They were able to cut corners for profit. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=712.78s)]
*  You had an article in The Lever by Freddie Brewster that the title of which was Airlines [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=716.66s)]
*  filed eighteen hundred reports warning regulators about Boeing 737 MAX, which is the plane [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=723.3s)]
*  that has caused a lot of these problems. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=729.3399999999999s)]
*  So why is it that even though the regulators were being notified of these safety problems, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=730.8199999999999s)]
*  these planes were continued to fly in such unsafe conditions? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=735.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, two reasons. Boeing is one of the biggest spenders on influence in Washington and has [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=740.02s)]
*  over many years essentially bought a deregulatory policy in which Boeing gets to do so-called [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=746.9399999999999s)]
*  self inspections, that the FAA, the oversight agency, is so understaffed and under budgeted [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=753.6999999999999s)]
*  that that the agency has effectively outsourced the inspections of these planes to the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=762.34s)]
*  companies themselves. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=767.9s)]
*  I mean, self inspection should be, you know, Ronald Reagan talked about the nine most [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=769.34s)]
*  terrifying words are, I'm from the government, I'm here to help. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=774.06s)]
*  To my mind, the nine most terrifying were the most terrifying words are self inspection [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=777.02s)]
*  of an airplane. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=782.5s)]
*  Right. And the thing is, as we reported as well, that within the manufacturing affiliate [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=783.9399999999999s)]
*  of Boeing, Spirit Aero Systems, there were workers who were also warning about safety [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=792.2199999999999s)]
*  concerns in the manufacturing process of the fuselages. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=799.42s)]
*  And so what we really see with Boeing and Boeing is a monopoly, that's another part of [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=803.4599999999999s)]
*  the problem here, in that Boeing is a monopoly that is under regulated, spending a huge [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=809.42s)]
*  amount of money on influence in Washington and spending ever more money on things like [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=817.9s)]
*  stock buybacks and executive compensation rather than capital investments in its own [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=822.74s)]
*  capital infrastructure. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=828.8199999999999s)]
*  It's really a perfect storm of bad. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=830.14s)]
*  And the hope is, is that the reporting that we and others do makes it a little bit better, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=834.22s)]
*  at least pressures the government to actually do a better job at this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=839.62s)]
*  You know, I had Lei Feng on my show a couple of days ago and he published reporting [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=843.18s)]
*  addressing the question that I think a lot of people are very confused about, which is [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=848.2199999999999s)]
*  we keep hearing that one of the reasons Ukraine is having so much difficulty on the battlefield [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=852.38s)]
*  against the Russians, aside from the population difference that prevents Ukrainians from [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=855.9399999999999s)]
*  sending men to the front line, is that they just can't keep up with the artillery production [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=860.3s)]
*  of the Russians. So you have the United States that spends more money than the next 15 [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=865.26s)]
*  countries combined on our military and even joining with NATO. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=869.9399999999999s)]
*  We have no industrial capacity to provide the Ukrainians with artillery, even though [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=873.38s)]
*  we're now two and a half years into the war. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=877.8199999999999s)]
*  And one of the reasons, as Lei described it, was very similar to what you're saying. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=879.42s)]
*  But just to illustrate the point that the way in which this one trillion dollar military [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  budget gets spent is not by assessing the national security needs of the United States [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=888.38s)]
*  or the needs of the military, but by having lobbyists, including from Boeing and North [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=893.1s)]
*  of Grimman and all these major military contractors come into Washington and lobby for the purchase [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=897.58s)]
*  of the most expensive weapons systems, including ones that end up being archaic and never working. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=903.38s)]
*  And the real national security needs end up getting completely neglected. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=908.86s)]
*  So I think so often a lot of people talk about corporate influence and it's very easy to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=913.7800000000001s)]
*  forget about it because a lot of times these concrete examples aren't really visible. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=919.0600000000001s)]
*  And I think one of the things you're doing best is just making this very visible, how [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=923.5s)]
*  easily they are able to influence and manipulate the lawmaking process. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=928.3s)]
*  And I'll just add to that on the on the Pentagon question. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=933.46s)]
*  I mean, Freddie Brewster, the same reporter, broke a big story last week about this very [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=935.98s)]
*  little notice program in the Pentagon itself, where top Pentagon officials are going to [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=941.98s)]
*  work at times inside of defense contractors in roles in which they are then influencing [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=946.86s)]
*  the Pentagon to purchase materials, equipment, et cetera, et cetera, from those contractors [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=954.7800000000001s)]
*  they are working at, which at one level seems I mean, it seems maybe not a big deal. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=960.7s)]
*  But at another level, it just underscores what you've just said, which is our decisions [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=966.4200000000001s)]
*  about purchasing, about what equipment is needed. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=971.3000000000001s)]
*  Are they being made on the basis of national security and governmental interest, or are [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=974.5s)]
*  they being made on the basis of who has the most influence, who has that influence to [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=979.74s)]
*  make to compel the government to pay the highest prices for things in lots of cases that the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=984.98s)]
*  government doesn't actually need? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=990.38s)]
*  Yeah. And of course, the Secretary of Defense who oversees the Pentagon came directly from [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=992.38s)]
*  the board of directors of Boeing in order to take the position as Pentagon chief under [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=996.58s)]
*  President Biden. Let me switch gears a little bit, because you have this relatively new [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1000.5s)]
*  podcast out where you talk about a lot of your reporting and other things as well. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1003.94s)]
*  And I was looking at some of the episodes in preparation for your coming on. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1008.1800000000001s)]
*  And one of the most recent ones you did focused on this question, I don't think has got [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1011.0200000000001s)]
*  nearly enough attention about just how anti-democratic the Democratic Party became in [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1015.0200000000001s)]
*  2024 in this election cycle to ensure that there could never be any debates or challenges [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1021.86s)]
*  within the party to the incumbent president, Joe Biden, even though all polls show how [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1027.54s)]
*  weak of a candidate he is. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1032.38s)]
*  What is it that the Democratic Party did that is special or different in order to ensure [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1033.78s)]
*  that there was no challenges possible? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1039.58s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1042.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think in the lead up in the last few years, the Democratic Party has done a [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1044.34s)]
*  very good job. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1049.42s)]
*  At least the top of the Democratic Party has been successful at essentially sending the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1050.8999999999999s)]
*  message that if you run a primary against a party-backed, establishment-backed candidates, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1056.46s)]
*  you will be spent into the ground. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1063.18s)]
*  You will potentially be blacklisted. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1064.98s)]
*  Your career inside of Democratic politics will essentially be over. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1066.78s)]
*  We have seen that over and over down the ballot. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1071.46s)]
*  Now, with regard to this current presidential election, I think what that has done is, first [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1074.02s)]
*  and foremost, it's said to any potential major candidate. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1080.0600000000002s)]
*  And by major, I mean, you know, a senator, a governor, candidates that have run in primaries [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1083.7s)]
*  in the past, it has said to them, if you even float your name, you are risking essentially [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1089.98s)]
*  career suicide. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1095.02s)]
*  Now, on top of that, you saw the Democratic Party frontload its primaries, frontloading [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1096.54s)]
*  primaries. The effect of that, putting states all up front, up at the top, having all the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1101.4599999999998s)]
*  primaries happen in very short order, it makes it harder for candidates to, in the past, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1107.74s)]
*  what they've done is they've won smaller states to build momentum, build name recognition, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1113.9399999999998s)]
*  build a fundraising base to run in future primaries by frontloading the primaries. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1118.86s)]
*  It makes that process, that prospect much harder. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1123.78s)]
*  In some states, the Democratic Party essentially canceled primaries. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1126.82s)]
*  Didn't just the party basically said we're not putting other candidates on the ballot [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1130.82s)]
*  other than Joe Biden, which is, to my mind, one of the most undemocratic things you can [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1136.06s)]
*  do. And meanwhile, one last thing I would say is that the Democratic media machine has [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1140.82s)]
*  spent, is now sort of, it's sort of an assumption that anybody running in a primary against [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1146.78s)]
*  any party establishment backed candidate is a fringe, is a joke, is something to not be [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1153.42s)]
*  taken seriously. You see that on MSNBC. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1160.98s)]
*  You see that framing all throughout sort of corporate media in general. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1164.46s)]
*  It's become kind of a religious assumption. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1168.94s)]
*  And the thing to understand, Glenn, and I think this is really important, is that this is in some ways [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1173.78s)]
*  extremely ahistorical. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1179.46s)]
*  As we trace in our podcast, which folks can go find at levertimepod.com, as we trace, the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1181.78s)]
*  Democratic Party had a culture of primaries. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1187.3s)]
*  I mean, you had Eugene McCarthy run against Lyndon Johnson. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1189.78s)]
*  You had Ted Kennedy run against Jimmy Carter. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1193.98s)]
*  Same thing for the Republicans, by the way. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1198.3799999999999s)]
*  Ronald Reagan run against Gerald Ford. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1199.74s)]
*  You had Pat Buchanan run against George H.W. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1201.8200000000002s)]
*  Bush. That culture seems to be gone from American politics. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1205.42s)]
*  And I don't think that's a very good thing. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1211.3000000000002s)]
*  I think that and I want to add one other thing. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1213.7s)]
*  The argument is, is that by having a primary, it hurts the general election nominee. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1216.6200000000001s)]
*  I think it's the exact opposite. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1221.94s)]
*  I think a tough competitive primary ends up battle testing and making sure the general [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1223.78s)]
*  election nominee can actually compete in the general election before they become the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1229.58s)]
*  general election nominee. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1234.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And you saw, you know, even though the former president, Donald Trump, was running [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1235.9399999999998s)]
*  in the Republican Party, they had a lot of he had a lot of challengers to his candidacy. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1240.78s)]
*  And as a result, even though he didn't participate, the Republican Party got in front of [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1246.8999999999999s)]
*  cameras and got in front of an audience and sold the Republican Party repeatedly while [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1249.9399999999998s)]
*  the Democrats were silent. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1254.82s)]
*  I remember early on, Simone Sanders. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1255.86s)]
*  This is when RFK Jr. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1258.54s)]
*  was still a candidate in the Democratic primary and he was polling at 15 to 20 percent. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1260.62s)]
*  And Cornel West was also a declared candidate within the Democratic Party and Marianne [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1265.1399999999999s)]
*  Williamson as well. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1272.06s)]
*  And you had, you know, 25 to 30 percent of Democrats saying they didn't want to vote for Joe [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1273.5s)]
*  Biden. And I saw Simone Sanders, who used to be Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's top White [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1276.8999999999999s)]
*  House aide and now works at MSNBC, the normal path. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1282.1399999999999s)]
*  Go on air and basically just say, we're not having a primary. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1285.14s)]
*  Our nominee is Joe Biden. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1288.94s)]
*  And, you know, I listened to it and I was wondering to myself, how can the DNC just [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1291.78s)]
*  declare that there's not going to be a primary? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1297.06s)]
*  And as you say, they did everything possible to ensure that it didn't happen at the same [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1299.34s)]
*  time that they're insisting that they're the only ones who can save American democracy. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1303.54s)]
*  David, let me ask you something about what I had alluded to earlier, which is this kind [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1309.22s)]
*  of new sentiment within the Republican Party. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1314.14s)]
*  I think in the Reagan era, Republicans were defined by Reaganomics by this idea that [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1317.7s)]
*  you do everything you can to help the bottom line and the profits of large corporations [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1323.8200000000002s)]
*  that are rising tide of salt boats that was supply side economics and eventually that [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1328.8600000000001s)]
*  profit for the highest and richest people would trickle down to the lower classes. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1333.18s)]
*  And I think very little of that happened. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1338.42s)]
*  And so now you have within the Republican Party, when Donald Trump ran in 2016, he [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1340.3799999999999s)]
*  challenged not only Bush Cheney foreign policy, but even Reagan economics, at least [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1344.34s)]
*  rhetorically. And you've had senators like Josh Hawley and J.D. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1348.86s)]
*  Vance who have ran on who have run on a position of economic populism. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1352.3799999999999s)]
*  And when Bernie Sanders held up the covid relief bill and said he would filibuster it [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1356.9399999999998s)]
*  unless they had direct payments to the American people, Josh Hawley was the one senator [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1363.62s)]
*  who stood at his side. And I believe Senator Hawley as well is defending these reforms [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1367.58s)]
*  to the airline bill. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1372.78s)]
*  Do you see any real emergence of a kind of populist or anti-corporate or pro-consumer [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1374.38s)]
*  sentiment within the Republican Party, even though it may not be the dominant strain? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1383.1s)]
*  Look, I think on Trump, I think he at times said things. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1388.58s)]
*  He echoed rhetoric that was an appeal economically to working class people. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1393.74s)]
*  I don't think he got any. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1401.02s)]
*  And he did veto that covid bill because the six hundred dollars that Bernie Sanders and [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1403.18s)]
*  Josh Hawley got, he said weren't enough. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1409.46s)]
*  And he said, I want two thousand dollars in this bill. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1411.06s)]
*  So there were occasional acts as well. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1413.6200000000001s)]
*  But I take your point about the prime. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1416.26s)]
*  Yes, I mean, I don't think he got right. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1418.46s)]
*  I don't think he governed much differently than than past Republicans when it came to [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1420.46s)]
*  economics. But I will I will say, I do think you are right to say that the Democratic [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1424.98s)]
*  Party on economics has clearly decided that it wants to appeal to it really doesn't want [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1430.54s)]
*  to talk very much about economics. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1438.74s)]
*  It wants to talk about cultural and social issues to appeal to kind of affluent voters. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1440.7s)]
*  And I think what that's left is a kind of vacuum and a and a competition for working class [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1447.22s)]
*  voters. Now, I think I think what's gone on is that the Republican Party has oftentimes [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1453.74s)]
*  tried to attract working class voters with purely cultural appeals while mixing in [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1458.5800000000002s)]
*  Reaganomics that hurts working class voters. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1464.3400000000001s)]
*  So I think the senators that you mention are see a potential opportunity. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1466.8600000000001s)]
*  They see an opportunity to make an economic appeal to working class voters. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1472.34s)]
*  Will they follow through and actually and actually follow that path? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1478.58s)]
*  I mean, that to me remains the big question. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1482.9399999999998s)]
*  It also remains a question to me is where is the New Deal wing of the Democratic Party? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1485.4199999999998s)]
*  Where did that wing of the Democratic Party go? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1490.2199999999998s)]
*  And by that, I mean the populist economic wing of the Democratic Party that existed [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1492.78s)]
*  into at least into the early Obama administration. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1497.82s)]
*  I think the answer to that question is that Wall Street doesn't like that part of the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1502.02s)]
*  Democratic Party and has worked very hard to rid that part of the Democratic Party from [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1506.46s)]
*  the party. So it has created a huge opportunity for the Republicans. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1511.86s)]
*  But I will say one last thing I want to say on this. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1516.46s)]
*  I'm not convinced that the Republican Party as a party, its leadership, its establishment [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1519.02s)]
*  is really serious about economic working class economics because it is a party that has been [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1525.1000000000001s)]
*  just really more aligned with corporate interests up until this point. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1533.02s)]
*  So so but again, I think things can shift. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1537.78s)]
*  It's going to remain to be seen whether they will. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1540.82s)]
*  Yes. Like I said, it's a strain, but it's by no means the dominant faction. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1542.82s)]
*  But you hope it grows. If you ask Josh Hawley or J.D. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1546.38s)]
*  Vance is those people of the world, they will tell you they think their future, the [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1550.38s)]
*  Republican Party, is to have affluent suburbanites migrate further to the Democratic [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1553.74s)]
*  Party as they've been doing and to have the Republican Party become the party of a [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1559.02s)]
*  multiracial working class. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1562.82s)]
*  And there's some voter trends that suggest that that's happening to some extent. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1564.42s)]
*  But I think there are people in the Republican Party who believe that that's the path to [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1569.74s)]
*  electoral success, whether that is matched by policy. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1574.06s)]
*  I mean, I just remain I will tell you, I remain mystified or not mystified. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1578.74s)]
*  I'm not confused about why, but it remains the the the the the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1582.58s)]
*  major weakness of the Democratic Party. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1588.06s)]
*  And to my mind right now is that it comes off as a party that is not interested in [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1590.22s)]
*  speaking economically to working class voters. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1596.02s)]
*  And that is a huge vulnerability. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1599.1s)]
*  They are betting. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1601.06s)]
*  And I'm not saying in the short term, it's necessarily a bad, a not smart political [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1602.34s)]
*  bet. They are betting that, for instance, the reproductive freedom choice [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1607.62s)]
*  abortion, et cetera, et cetera, that that argument about how the Republicans have gone [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1612.5s)]
*  so far to the to the extreme end on that, that that alone will win them the election. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1616.54s)]
*  I think that's a a dangerous gamble for the long haul. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1621.98s)]
*  If you don't have a message about what people are dealing with economically, what the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1626.02s)]
*  working class is dealing with economically, you may be able to win an election here or [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1630.78s)]
*  there on cultural issues, social issues, which are important. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1635.42s)]
*  You may be able to win some of those elections. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1639.78s)]
*  But over the long haul, the question always comes typically in America comes back to [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1641.82s)]
*  are you better off than you were four years ago and better off, meaning better off on [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_YLQktSN8&t=1646.6599999999999s)]
