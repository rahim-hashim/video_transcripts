# Breaking Down Israel-Gaza, w/ Martyr Made | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14)
*  Let's start with Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=0.0s)]
*  Obviously, this war is horrific. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=9.72s)]
*  It is ongoing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=13.24s)]
*  The US is heavily involved in multiple ways. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=14.4s)]
*  One of the things you did that brought a lot of attention before October 7th is you decided [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=18.56s)]
*  to compile and then publish this sort of mini documentary of the history of the State of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=23.04s)]
*  Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=29.36s)]
*  What is it that motivated you to do that and what is it that you think people needed to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=33.26s)]
*  know about this history that you thought it would be worthwhile? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=36.68s)]
*  Yes, sure. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=40.08s)]
*  I've always been a book nerd and a history nerd. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=41.96s)]
*  I happened to come across that topic maybe about a decade ago where I started really [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=44.6s)]
*  digging into it past the television news and sort of magazine article level. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  I guess it was the shock that I had when I started looking into the topic and realizing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=56.56s)]
*  that the picture I had of it, which was the typical picture most Americans who know the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=62.52s)]
*  topic at a surface level have, how far removed from reality that picture that I had was. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=67.56s)]
*  As I learned more and more about it and got to know people on both sides of that conflict, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=76.04s)]
*  I found that it's one of those topics that the more somebody learns about it, regardless [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=84.12s)]
*  of which side they're on, if they're on a side and they learn more about the topic, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=91.2s)]
*  they will become more understanding and empathetic of the other side. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  It's just one of those topics where that's always true. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  I think it's really easy to forget that you were touching on this quite a bit when you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=103.48s)]
*  were talking about Ukraine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=110.44s)]
*  It's easy to forget in America what it's like to go through a tremendous amount of suffering [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  and what that can do to a people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=119.08s)]
*  If you think back to Germany after World War I, if you think about the Russians now, people [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=122.16s)]
*  wonder how they can support Putin so strongly. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=130.0s)]
*  Just go to Russia in the 1990s and find out what that place was like. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=134.08s)]
*  Putin was the guy in charge when that turned around. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=139.92s)]
*  That's going to generate a lot of loyalty. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=141.88s)]
*  If you go back to the US Civil War, that was the last time we really had a war that affected [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Americans on a large scale. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  One out of every 18 or 20 men in America was a casualty in that war. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  Down south, one out of every five military-age males was a casualty in that war. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  After that war was over, everybody really had this idea that that was terrible, that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=166.92s)]
*  was a bad idea, even if it ended slavery. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=171.32s)]
*  That was just a traumatic experience for our country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=174.88s)]
*  There was a real push and a real feeling on both sides of the North-South divide that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=177.88s)]
*  we needed to try to heal those wounds and move past that, because everybody had experienced [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=182.44s)]
*  the pain that came with that war. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  That was a century and a half ago at this point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=188.72s)]
*  It was really the last time we had that kind of experience. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=192.52s)]
*  So now, when we look at a lot of these wars, I think we forgot what it's like to not just [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=196.36s)]
*  have your sons go off and die, that's awful, but to have your kids die in a war, like your [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=203.56s)]
*  small children die in a war, your wife die in a war. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=209.84s)]
*  We just don't remember what that's like as Americans. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  We end up cheering it on as if it's a spectator sport. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=215.68s)]
*  In Palestine, I think there's always been a disconnect between... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=221.28s)]
*  People find it very easy to humanize the Israelis. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=233.08s)]
*  They meet Israelis, they're more or less like Americans with some differences, and they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=236.84s)]
*  can relate to them very easily. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=242.4s)]
*  Palestinians, they think that there's a very orientalist view of the Palestinians as somehow [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  much more foreign. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=250.2s)]
*  Obviously, 9-11 didn't help with that, with our perception of the Muslim world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=251.2s)]
*  But when you get to know the people there, when you spend time in the West Bank, the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=257.12s)]
*  emails I get from people who listen to the podcast series and actually came away with [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=260.76s)]
*  more sympathy for what the Jews were going through in Europe when they were driven to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=264.96s)]
*  adopt Zionism as an ideology in the first place, these are just regular people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=269.96s)]
*  These are just regular people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=275.64s)]
*  They have the same feelings, same emotions the rest of us have. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=278.0s)]
*  I think that we as Americans, when there's a conflict like the one that's going on between [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=282.12s)]
*  the Israelis and the Palestinians, we have the benefit of being able to step back, of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=287.88s)]
*  being able to respond not emotionally to everything that's happening. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=296.36s)]
*  We really ought to take seriously our role as a peacemaker in situations like that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=301.56s)]
*  Actually, for quite a while, we did do that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=306.6s)]
*  Say what you want about somebody like Bill Clinton, but he put a lot of work in to try [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  to at least move the ball forward in the peace process. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  We saw that as our role in the conflict. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=315.88s)]
*  That has really all changed since maybe the mid-2000s or so. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=321.68s)]
*  When now, from the highest levels of power all the way down to the people on the street [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  and on Twitter, when this conflict kicked off, this most recent round of violence kicked [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=333.84s)]
*  off, it's as if people see it as their job to egg the other side on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=340.08s)]
*  It's totally understandable after what happened on October 7th that the Israelis were going [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=348.32s)]
*  to be in a nasty mood. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  You go back after 9-11, it would have been great if we could have stepped back. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=356.67999999999995s)]
*  That's asking a lot. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=361.96s)]
*  Something like that happens. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=363.28s)]
*  The country involved is going to want to do something about it just to get it back. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=364.28s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=370.0s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=371.0s)]
*  But we, as Israel's friend, as a country, and one that is disconnected from this, we [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=372.0s)]
*  ought to play the role of trying to talk them off that ledge. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  We just have abandoned that role altogether, all over the world. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=382.55999999999995s)]
*  During the Cold War, we viewed chaos around the world as a very dangerous thing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=386.56s)]
*  In 1973, when the Israelis and Arab countries were fighting the Yom Kippur War, the Soviet [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  Union was supplying weapons and backing the Egyptians and the Syrians. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=406.36s)]
*  We kind of came nose to nose with the Soviet Union in a military sense for the first time [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=412.68s)]
*  since the Cuban Missile Crisis a decade before. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=418.04s)]
*  Both the United States and the Soviet Union, we went to our respective sides that we had [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  influence with and said, hey, enough is enough. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=426.72s)]
*  You guys got to cut it out because this could get really ugly. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=429.72s)]
*  That was kind of our attitude throughout the Cold War because we knew in the Cold War that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=433.0s)]
*  this could get really ugly for us if things spin out of control. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=437.24s)]
*  Since the Cold War ended, I think there's a whole different calculus that American policymakers [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=442.48s)]
*  are making in terms of the cost benefit analysis of generating chaos in the world. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=448.68s)]
*  You think back to in the late 90s and early 2000s, we had a US Marine Special Operations [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=457.16s)]
*  Detachment based out of Istanbul that was running training operations. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=466.36s)]
*  We were arming and funding several of the Islamist militias in Chechnya that were continuing [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=471.92s)]
*  to cause problems for the Russians. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=476.88s)]
*  We did that even for several years after Chechnya was defeated and Kadyrov was put in power. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  The war was over and there was no chance they were going to storm back and win that war [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=487.04s)]
*  or anything. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=491.68s)]
*  It was just keeping the pot boiling. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=493.48s)]
*  I remember I was talking to one of the Marines who was involved with that operation at the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=495.12s)]
*  time and I said, why did we keep doing it after there was no military reason to do it? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  They weren't going to reconquer Chechnya and take their country back. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=506.72s)]
*  He said what everybody he knew talked to and the idea that all the Marines he was working [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=510.12s)]
*  with had was that the idea was just to keep the thing going because there's a lot of reasons, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=514.96s)]
*  but it gave Russia something that it had to deal with. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=521.78s)]
*  It prevented them from rebuilding Chechnya, from building a pipeline they wanted to put [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=525.42s)]
*  through there to compete with one of our natural gas pipelines. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=530.38s)]
*  It made them dedicate military and diplomatic resources to the region. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  Chaos is good. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=539.74s)]
*  Chaos is actually good. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=540.74s)]
*  We have seen this again and again and again in the Middle East where we don't fear chaos [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=542.02s)]
*  anymore. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=546.5s)]
*  We see it as an asset. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=547.5s)]
*  We see it as a problem that our rivals actually end up having to deal with. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=548.5s)]
*  That's a very toxic approach, obviously, to take the foreign policy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=555.5s)]
*  Let me ask you, it's so interesting. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=558.66s)]
*  President Trump, when he was running for office the first time in 2015, prided himself more [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=562.02s)]

*  He wrote The Art of the Deal, became his signature accomplishment that he could do deals, negotiate [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=571.94s)]
*  deals better than anybody. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=579.7800000000001s)]
*  He looked at war as a failure of the ability to negotiate, which is how a lot of people [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=581.1400000000001s)]
*  have seen it throughout the ages. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=584.94s)]
*  I think he prided himself on the fact that he was the first president in decades not [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=586.4200000000001s)]
*  to take the US into a new war. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=590.5400000000001s)]
*  His instinct when he first talked about Israel and Palestine, one of the very first times [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=596.34s)]
*  he talked about it when he was running was to say, we become way too pro-Israel and as [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=599.64s)]
*  a result, we have lost the ability to foster negotiations because nobody trusts us as an [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=604.28s)]
*  honest broker anywhere. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=610.64s)]
*  We have to be much more neutral so that we can regain the ability to get a deal done [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=611.64s)]
*  so that we don't have this instability and these dangers. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=616.12s)]
*  Very quickly he got into line behind the AIPAC way of looking at things for whatever reasons. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=620.4s)]
*  He became one of the most vehemently pro-Israel presidents in history. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=626.94s)]
*  Netanyahu loved him, kind of gave the Israelis everything they wanted, although at the same [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=630.9000000000001s)]
*  time the Israeli-Palestinian situation was kind of quiet when he was in office. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=635.3800000000001s)]
*  The reality though is we are an extremely pro-Israel country and have been for decades. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=639.82s)]
*  It's been a long time since an American president was willing in any public or meaningful way [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=644.94s)]
*  to confront the Israelis and say what you're doing is harmful to our national interests. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=650.58s)]
*  That was in Bush 41 when James Baker and Brent Scowcroft and even Bush said, look, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=654.5s)]
*  we're not going to continue to give you loan guarantees if you keep expanding settlements [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=661.06s)]
*  in the West Bank because to do so is to jeopardize the possibility for a peace deal which in [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=664.38s)]
*  turn harms our national security. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=669.78s)]
*  James Baker got widely vilified as an anti-Semite. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=672.26s)]
*  They kind of backed down and ever since we've been a aggressively pro-Israel country on [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=674.74s)]
*  a very bipartisan basis, we give more aid to Israel than any other country. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=679.94s)]
*  They get more aid from us than they get it from anywhere else. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=684.3s)]
*  Where the pro-Israel resolution in the Congress comes up, it passes like 421 to 6, something [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=687.14s)]
*  so up-sided that almost no other issue produces. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  As a result, I think Americans are largely immersed in the pro-Israel narrative all the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=699.0799999999999s)]
*  time. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=704.9799999999999s)]
*  Our media is pro-Israel. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=705.9799999999999s)]
*  I know people like to deny this who are very pro-Israel, but you just look at the facts [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=706.9799999999999s)]
*  and it's undeniably true. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=712.18s)]
*  I think what a lot of people believe, Darrell, about this conflict is that, look, at the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=714.62s)]
*  end of the day, no matter what else you want to say, you have Israel that's a democratic [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=720.38s)]
*  country and wants to live in peace with its neighbors. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=726.54s)]
*  On the other hand, you have Muslims who just hate Jews and hate Israel and want to take [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=729.58s)]
*  Israel off the map. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=736.9s)]
*  The only goal is to kill all Jews and therefore there's no way to side with anyone but Israel [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=737.9s)]
*  because Israel is the only one there trying to be humanistic and noble and civilized. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=743.9399999999999s)]
*  The rest are just these primitive, hateful people who hate Jews and want to kill them [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=753.5799999999999s)]
*  all. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=757.4599999999999s)]
*  What would you say to people who believe that? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=761.14s)]
*  Remember when we were kids and you would have your younger brother or maybe your younger [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=765.38s)]
*  cousin or something and you were picking on him, bullying him a little bit, and you're [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=771.14s)]
*  holding him down and maybe you're just torturing him a little bit just to show him you're stronger [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=775.9s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=781.62s)]
*  And he gets really, really, really angry. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=783.2199999999999s)]
*  He's like, let me up, let me up, you better let me up right now. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=785.26s)]
*  And he starts fighting, struggling, maybe tries to bite your wrist or something to get [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=787.62s)]
*  you to let him go. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=791.5s)]
*  And now at this point, you got to hold on because the little guy is really angry and [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=792.54s)]
*  you tell him, you know, I'm going to let you up if you stop struggling. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=795.98s)]
*  And he's like, screw you. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=800.06s)]
*  I'm not stopping. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=801.06s)]
*  It's a similar situation to that in a lot of ways. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=802.82s)]
*  You know, there's no question that and I think everybody, everybody, even very pro-Israel [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=804.98s)]
*  people in my experience, when they really learn the history of the pre-1948 period, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=813.26s)]
*  they come away with a lot of sympathy for what happened to the Palestinians. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=817.26s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about three quarters of a million people who got driven out of [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=820.86s)]
*  their homes at gunpoint and not allowed to return. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=825.86s)]
*  Right. And those people's grandchildren are still are still in the places that they [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=829.7s)]
*  fled to. And that's a raw deal. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=833.98s)]
*  You can have sympathy for what the Zionists were trying to do because of the pogroms they [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=836.74s)]
*  were reacting to in Europe and everything. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=842.58s)]
*  But there's no question that, like, the Zionists may have been jumping out of a burning [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=844.34s)]
*  building by going from Europe to Palestine, but they landed on somebody on the way down on [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=848.54s)]
*  the sidewalk. And that guy got really angry because he didn't understand that there was a [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=853.7s)]
*  burning building that you were jumping out of. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=858.42s)]
*  He just knows somebody landed on him and it hurts. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=860.54s)]
*  Or he didn't understand why it was that he had to give up his land because the Europeans [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=862.78s)]
*  had a Holocaust against the Jews. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=870.98s)]
*  Like, the question was, why don't you in Europe give part of your land since you're the ones who [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=872.54s)]
*  did this? Like, how do we have to give up our land to pay for your crimes? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=877.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, especially most people, I think when I talk to people about this, I realize a lot of [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=884.78s)]
*  the time that the average person thinks this is an ancient, ancient conflict, like it goes [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=890.58s)]
*  back thousands of years. Right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=896.5400000000001s)]
*  It's ancient. You know, it's ever since Ishmael and, you know, and Isaac were born. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=897.78s)]
*  They've just been. That's just not true. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=903.46s)]
*  I've got a photograph from 1913, so the year before the First World War and the year before [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=905.46s)]
*  business in Palestine really started to accelerate. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=913.86s)]
*  And it's a picture from a cafe in Jerusalem or I think it might be in Jaffa, actually. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=916.7s)]
*  Yeah. And it's a picture of a band playing in this cafe. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=923.1800000000001s)]
*  And it's two Muslims, a Jew and a Christian playing in a band together. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=927.4200000000001s)]
*  In 1913, it's not that long before the founding of Israel and everything spun out of control. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=932.1800000000001s)]
*  Things were not. This was not a blood feud much more than 100 years ago. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=937.54s)]
*  You know, this is a modern political dispute that is very much the result of a modern [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=945.38s)]
*  ideology. It's not even really so much of a religious impulse as much as Zionism does [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=951.94s)]
*  draw on, you know, sort of ancient mythology to tie people to it and motivate people. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=957.6999999999999s)]
*  This is a nationalist phenomenon. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=963.1s)]
*  This is something that emerged out of modernity, out of Europe, specifically where [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=964.9s)]
*  nationalism was on the rise. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=969.3399999999999s)]
*  And you had this group of people who needed a who needed a country. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=970.9s)]
*  I mean, let's just you know, the lesson of the Jews in the last thousand years and the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=973.98s)]
*  lesson of the Palestinians in the last 70 years or so is that everybody needs their [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=977.8199999999999s)]
*  own country. You know, it's not it's just it's not good to be a minority in somebody [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=983.9s)]
*  else's country. It's better in some than it is in others. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=989.46s)]
*  But it's nice to have somewhere to go. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=993.22s)]
*  And the Jews needed that. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=995.38s)]
*  And, yeah, unfortunately, they did end up landing on somebody who had nothing to do [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=998.3000000000001s)]
*  with the situation. And, you know, the United States, we actually recognized and had [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1003.1800000000001s)]
*  some level of neutrality in the situation up till about the late 60s, early 70s. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1011.14s)]
*  You know, Lyndon Johnson was the first very strongly Zionist American president. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1016.14s)]
*  And the president's previous had had misgivings. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1021.1s)]
*  I mean, Eisenhower made the Israelis and the French and the British skedaddle from [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1024.74s)]
*  Egypt after the after the Suez crisis in 56. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1028.1s)]
*  And they weren't happy about that. But he didn't care. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1031.74s)]
*  He had a cold war to fight. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1034.02s)]
*  Ever since then, we have been. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1035.9s)]
*  You know, lock, stock and barrel only for for Israel, we don't care what the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1039.3s)]
*  Palestinian grievances are, just like we didn't care what the Russians grievances [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1043.46s)]
*  were in the lead up to the Ukrainian war. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1047.7s)]
*  We know there was a big kerfuffle over on Twitter the other day because because some [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1051.58s)]
*  people were talking about reading Osama bin Laden's letter to America about his [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1056.1000000000001s)]
*  reasons for 9-11 and just hearing for the first time kind of what his actual [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1060.9s)]
*  grievances were. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1066.14s)]
*  And that doesn't justify what people do or anything. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1068.1000000000001s)]
*  But we ought to like if there's a long running conflict, especially. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1070.94s)]
*  We should be having conversations about like, OK, what is it these people are so [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1076.3000000000002s)]
*  upset about that they're willing to die in large numbers, they're willing to take on [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1080.3000000000002s)]
*  a state like Israel or a state like America, they're willing to incur our wrath [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1085.5s)]
*  because of something that's really apparently bothering them. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1090.26s)]
*  What is it? We don't do that at all. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1093.58s)]
*  We just, you know, we put everything in the same framing that we use for World War [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1095.54s)]
*  Two, where they're evil, they're irrational. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1100.3s)]
*  You cannot possibly negotiate with these people. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1103.5s)]
*  They don't have any legitimate grievances. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1105.82s)]
*  They don't have any any anything driving them toward this conflict other than [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1107.74s)]
*  hatred for us and our way of life. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1113.54s)]
*  And I think that most people don't actually believe that. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1115.46s)]
*  But for some reason, maybe it has to do with the media environment or just the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1122.3s)]
*  structure of our of our democratic political system. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1126.18s)]
*  The people who do take that line wield a disproportionate amount of influence in [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1129.1000000000001s)]
*  the discourse. Right. And so and this is something that you see drive the Israeli [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1134.26s)]
*  Palestinian conflict, especially people like you said, think that the Israelis [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1137.7s)]
*  want peace, the Palestinians don't want peace. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1143.82s)]
*  That's totally just a historical nonsense. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1145.54s)]
*  OK, there are good people on both sides who have worked extremely hard for peace. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1149.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, the Palestinian negotiators like Saeb Erekat, a lot of people who who [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1155.26s)]
*  were very dedicated to trying to figure out a negotiated solution. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1160.7s)]
*  They worked for years on it. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1164.4199999999998s)]
*  And so a lot of Israelis. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1166.54s)]
*  And there are also elements on both sides like Hamas, like the Likud party, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1168.02s)]
*  especially as it is under under Netanyahu, who truly do not want peace. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1173.98s)]
*  You know, they see a future further down the road that if things keep going the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1179.74s)]
*  way that they're going right now, that they're going to end up in a much better [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1185.3400000000001s)]
*  place than they would if they negotiated a solution. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1189.54s)]
*  They believe that. And they want to keep the conflict going until they're able to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1192.42s)]
*  until that happens. You think about how the when the Oslo Accords broke down and [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1197.82s)]
*  within a couple like a very short period of time, an extremist Jewish nationalist [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1202.46s)]
*  assassinated the Israeli prime minister who was negotiating it for what he thought [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1208.46s)]
*  for what he was giving away. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1212.34s)]
*  Hamas lights off a couple of suicide bombs on buses in Tel Aviv. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1214.62s)]
*  That's all it took years of work down the drain because both sides now all of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1218.34s)]
*  sudden are retrenching the people who said you can't trust those people. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1222.6599999999999s)]
*  They're animals. They're they hate us. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1227.58s)]
*  You know, they got validation and and they heated a moment in a situation like that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1229.86s)]
*  They're able to shout everybody else down. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1237.3s)]
*  And so, you know, those the extreme and flexible maximalist elements on both sides [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1239.46s)]
*  of a conflict like this tend to be able to drag the rest of us down to their level [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1247.1s)]
*  over time. And I think we ought to. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1251.86s)]
*  You know, as again, as the outside party. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1255.86s)]
*  We really ought to work like see that it is our we've got a duty if we're going to [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1259.78s)]
*  be involved in this to try to move both sides toward peace rather than egging on [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1265.06s)]
*  the conflict. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1269.6599999999999s)]
*  And let me let me ask you about this, because, you know, like in every conflict, you [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1270.9799999999998s)]
*  always are going to have extremists who don't want to resolve the conflict, who [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1276.82s)]
*  want maximalist goals to be achieved. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1280.3s)]
*  You never need rid of those. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1283.26s)]
*  The question is, are you going to do things that drive people into their arms that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1284.8999999999999s)]
*  cause them to be supported more to have people view their way of looking at things [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1289.22s)]
*  as valid? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1294.34s)]
*  Obviously, one of the reasons Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda attacked the United [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1295.6599999999999s)]
*  States is they were hoping to provoke the response they did, making people more and [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1299.06s)]
*  more hate the United States, driving them into the arms of extremists. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1302.98s)]
*  It's not a conspiracy theory. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1306.98s)]
*  It's something extremely talked about in mainstream Israeli circles that Netanyahu [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1308.5s)]
*  wanted Hamas to govern Gaza. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1312.5s)]
*  He partnered with Hamas because he didn't want a more moderate face of the Palestinian [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1315.34s)]
*  movement to be seen or to govern because then he was fearful that might lead to a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1319.46s)]
*  solution. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1325.26s)]
*  And the same with Hamas. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1326.18s)]
*  Clearly part of why Hamas attacked is they wanted the Israelis to do exactly what [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1328.26s)]
*  they're doing so that people in Gaza and in the West Bank start to hate Israel more [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1331.74s)]
*  and drive them into the hands of Hamas and away from the more moderate voices. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1336.38s)]
*  So extremists always want that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1342.02s)]
*  They kind of have a sort of common cause, if you like. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1343.66s)]
*  But you alluded to this earlier. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1348.74s)]
*  I think you're exactly right. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1351.82s)]
*  Obviously, after something like October 7th, regardless of the context, regardless of [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1352.86s)]
*  the grievances that pre-existed that attack, no country can stand by and watch [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1356.66s)]
*  their citizens killed in the most horrific ways and not take action. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1362.7s)]
*  Like no government would survive that. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1368.22s)]
*  No population would tolerate inaction after an attack like that. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1370.0600000000002s)]
*  So Israel clearly had to do something. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1375.0600000000002s)]
*  But it was clear from the start, at least to me, given what they were saying and what [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1377.6200000000001s)]
*  I know about the Israeli government, the current composition of it, that they weren't [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1381.78s)]
*  saying we're going to go in and kill the leaders of Hamas. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1385.6200000000001s)]
*  They were saying this is going to be a war unlike anything you've ever seen before. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1388.46s)]
*  It's going to be unprecedented. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1392.8600000000001s)]
*  Natalia Bennett was writing an essay in The Economist saying our real goal is to show [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1394.18s)]
*  the world that we are so unhinged, so willing to kill in large numbers, that we're [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1399.5s)]
*  going to put fear in the hearts of our enemies for generations. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1404.5s)]
*  And even though they'll hate us, they'll be afraid to attack us. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1407.26s)]
*  And there's obviously speculation that part of the Israeli motive is to drive [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1410.22s)]
*  Palestinians out of Gaza because their goal, in reality, is to annex Gaza, to [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1415.1000000000001s)]
*  annex more and more of the West Bank until they control the whole thing. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1421.06s)]
*  What do you think is the real goal or goals in terms of the Israeli government and [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1424.02s)]
*  why it's unleashing this amount of violence and destruction on Gaza? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1430.7s)]
*  You know, a longtime mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kolek, a very quotable guy, he had [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1438.26s)]
*  this famous quote, some reporter asked him, what do you think about the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1445.3s)]
*  Palestinian problem or what should be done about terrorism? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1450.74s)]
*  And he said, problem? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1453.82s)]
*  We don't have a problem. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1455.1799999999998s)]
*  Problems have solutions. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1456.4599999999998s)]
*  What we have is a condition and you treat, you manage conditions, what he said. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1457.8999999999999s)]
*  And that's, you know, we hear the phrase mowing the lawn today with referent. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1462.54s)]
*  It's pretty macabre, but people use it in mainstream circles in Israel to refer to [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1466.3799999999999s)]
*  these periodic operations in Gaza. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1471.4199999999998s)]
*  And so you ask, what is the real purpose of that? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1474.8999999999999s)]
*  If the people order, you know, if the people ordering these assaults really don't, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1476.86s)]
*  they don't really think that they can go in there and, you know, they know that [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1481.1s)]
*  even if they go in and round up every single member of Hamas and execute them, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1486.1s)]
*  that that's not going to end Hamas. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1490.3s)]
*  That's just, that's going to, they know enough about this stuff. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1491.6999999999998s)]
*  They know enough about counterinsurgency to know how this works. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1494.62s)]
*  And Hamas is an idea. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1498.1399999999999s)]
*  The idea of resistance to Israel and all this is an idea. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1499.86s)]
*  And, you know, they can't stamp that out by killing even a lot of people. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1503.8999999999999s)]
*  And so they know better than that. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1509.9399999999998s)]
*  So you have to ask, like, what is it they're really trying to do? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1512.3s)]
*  And I think over the course of Israeli history, they've gone through periods, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1515.02s)]
*  sometimes long periods where it's just absolutely undeniable that the strategy [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1519.26s)]
*  that they had in mind was simply collective punishment. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1524.06s)]
*  And they wanted to terrorize the Palestinian population, the civilian population [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1527.82s)]
*  of Palestine, terrorize them enough that maybe they would turn on, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1532.14s)]
*  you know, a group like Hamas, but even failing that, like, I don't think they [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1538.8200000000002s)]
*  really believe that's going to happen. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1543.1000000000001s)]
*  We could do something like that in Iraq, say, like when we went into Ramadi and [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1545.5400000000002s)]
*  actually put real, real deal counterinsurgency tactics to work in Ramadi. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1550.46s)]
*  We got a lot of buy-in from tribal leaders who ended up helping us out in [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1555.46s)]
*  turning on al-Qaeda because we made it worth their while and we proved that we [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1560.5s)]
*  can defend them. But the thing is, in Ramadi and throughout Iraq, the jihadists [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1563.78s)]
*  that we were dealing with there, at least half of them, in a lot of places, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1568.9s)]
*  60, 70, 75, 80 percent of the jihadists were from, they were not Iraqis. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1573.22s)]
*  They were from all over the place. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1578.98s)]
*  They were from Afghanistan and Chechnya and all over. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1580.14s)]
*  And so it was a lot easier to get these Iraqis to turn on these foreigners who [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1583.1s)]
*  very often were terrorizing the population in extraordinary ways, extorting them, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1588.14s)]
*  taking advantage of their daughters. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1592.0200000000002s)]
*  And so it didn't take all that much. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1594.22s)]
*  In Gaza, you know, you're talking about, you know, there's a lot of people in Gaza, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1595.66s)]
*  don't get me wrong, who do not like Hamas. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1601.42s)]
*  I hear from them a lot. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1603.26s)]
*  But those are still their people. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1605.42s)]
*  You know, it's still a friend of a friend who occasionally runs errands for a guy [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1607.8600000000001s)]
*  that is affiliated with Hamas. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1612.22s)]
*  So they're part of the same social networks and it's much more complicated to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1613.46s)]
*  root that out. You know, I asked somebody the other day, we've all seen Red Dawn. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1617.7s)]
*  How long would it take? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1624.22s)]
*  What would the Russians have had to do in the movie Red Dawn for you to turn on [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1625.82s)]
*  an American group that was resisting them, no matter how brutal and how much you [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1631.5s)]
*  disagreed with the tactics of that group? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1635.66s)]
*  What would the Russians really have to do? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1637.46s)]
*  And the answer is there's almost nothing they could do to make that happen. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1638.94s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that I think that the goal and it sounds to our American [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1643.5800000000002s)]
*  ears because we really don't think this way anymore. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1650.94s)]
*  There were times in our past when we certainly did. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1654.18s)]
*  But to our credit, like for all of the terrible things that went down in Iraq and [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1657.94s)]
*  Afghanistan, when you consider the savagery of the insurgency that we were fighting, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1663.7800000000002s)]
*  especially in Iraq, and compare the behavior of American troops there to the behavior of [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1668.9s)]
*  American troops, say, in Vietnam, which was not that long ago, we made tremendous strides [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1676.42s)]
*  like toward having a more disciplined force that really did go out of its way, especially after [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1681.14s)]
*  about 2004 to try to avoid civilian casualties. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1687.14s)]
*  You know, when we went into Ramadi in 2006 and 2007, we could have done that like we did [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1691.22s)]
*  Fallujah in 2004 and just sent the Marines in to flatten the place. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1695.54s)]
*  But we'd kind of learned the lesson that that really actually doesn't help. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1699.3799999999999s)]
*  And in a lot of ways, it makes things worse. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1703.3799999999999s)]
*  And so we put our guys on the line. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1705.3s)]
*  I mean, we put our soldiers and Iraqi allied soldiers at risk to actually go into these [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1707.78s)]
*  neighborhoods and do it in a much more surgical way in a place like Ramadi. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1713.3799999999999s)]
*  And it was very effective. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1717.1399999999999s)]
*  I think that, you know, the Israelis, ever since the Israelis left Gaza, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1718.18s)]
*  or pulled their settlers and forces out of Gaza, that really marked a change in the way that [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1726.1000000000001s)]
*  Israel approached the conflict altogether. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1731.38s)]
*  Throughout most of their history, again, with episodes of insanity, they focused on targeted [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1734.18s)]
*  assassinations. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1741.94s)]
*  They focused on a lot on intelligence. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1743.06s)]
*  And they were very cognizant of they treated it like a counterinsurgency. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1746.02s)]
*  And they were they were conscious of collateral damage. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1750.8200000000002s)]
*  They were conscious of the impact on their reputation around the world. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1753.14s)]
*  They had the United States telling them, like, we can't have you in the Cold War, causing [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1757.46s)]
*  all these problems with the Arab countries. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1761.54s)]
*  And so there were there were breaks on how they handled it. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1763.78s)]
*  And ever since they pulled out of their people out of Gaza, they've really [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1767.06s)]
*  changed to just a full blown military response to Palestinian terrorism. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1772.02s)]
*  And, you know, I think when you when you look at what's happening in Gaza, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1778.5800000000002s)]
*  of course, everybody's going to call you an Israel hater or anti-Semitic or all the [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1783.46s)]
*  thing. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1788.18s)]
*  Everybody gets pro-Hamas, pro-terrorism, pro-Hamas. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1788.42s)]
*  You want to promote war. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1791.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1792.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1792.9s)]
*  But the question is not whether what you think of Israel in a broad sense, it's not what you [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1793.54s)]
*  think of the history in a broad sense. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1799.38s)]
*  Any of that stuff, whether Israel has a right to exist. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1801.06s)]
*  The question is, is Israel behave is Israel meeting the standards of the first world [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1803.7s)]
*  democratic countries in the world for trying to avoid at least trying to avoid civilian [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1813.22s)]
*  casualties? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1820.4199999999998s)]
*  And that's all I you know, when I when I look at what they're especially in the first several [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1821.62s)]
*  weeks of this conflict, you watch what they're doing. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1826.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's possible to make the case that they were living up to those standards. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1828.1s)]
*  Something like when they when they hit the Jabaliyah refugee camp and the Israeli spokesman, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1833.86s)]
*  the IDF spokesman was talking to Wolf Blitzer and Wolf asked him, you know, knowing there [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1842.02s)]
*  were civilians there, you still hit this thing. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1850.26s)]
*  And the guy said, well, there might have been tunnels there. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1852.58s)]
*  And my ears pricked up. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1855.3s)]
*  I was like, might have been tunnels. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1856.34s)]
*  And then he said, well, the terrorists that you were trying to hit there, did you kill [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1858.58s)]
*  them? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1862.58s)]
*  And he said, we're looking into that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1862.66s)]
*  And it's like you hit a refugee camp with six JDAMs based on the idea there might have [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1864.5s)]
*  been tunnels there and that you might have had a guy that you were able to kill who was [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1871.86s)]
*  bad. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1876.66s)]
*  I would want the American commander who ordered something like that in Iraq or wherever, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1877.54s)]
*  anywhere in the world. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1884.34s)]
*  I would want that guy put on trial. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1885.06s)]
*  Like, for some reason, we make exceptions for Israel that truly we would not make for [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1886.8999999999999s)]
*  our own forces. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1895.7s)]
*  There is much more outrage over things that came out during the Iraq war than things that [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1897.06s)]
*  are really pretty overwhelming, overwhelmingly worse when you look at what's going on in [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1905.78s)]
*  Gaza and what's been going on for a long time. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1911.94s)]
*  You're talking about a stateless population where half the population is women, half the [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1913.86s)]
*  population is under 18 years old. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1924.26s)]
*  You're talking about maybe 20% of the population are men over age 18, maybe about 12 to 15% [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1926.9799999999998s)]
*  of the population are men between 18 and 40. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1936.74s)]
*  So like military age men, broadly speaking. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1939.6999999999998s)]
*  These are people who have homemade rockets and AK-47s and obviously they proved on October [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1944.4199999999998s)]
*  7th that that can do a lot of damage. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1950.34s)]
*  That's extremely dangerous and is something that Israelis take very seriously. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1951.9399999999998s)]
*  But is that something that merits a regular military, full-blown military assault kind [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1957.6999999999998s)]
*  of response? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1964.6599999999999s)]
*  The idea that Hamas uses human shields, I'm sure there's something to that. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1967.3s)]
*  But that's to me not really the point. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1974.02s)]
*  It's not their responsibility to look after these people. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1976.6599999999999s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1979.1399999999999s)]
*  Pretty much every country on earth, their attitude toward Hamas is if you find one of [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1982.1s)]
*  them, kill them. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1987.54s)]
*  That's how Hamas gets treated by the global community. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1989.3799999999999s)]
*  There's no pretension that they are a first world democratic country that ought to be [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1991.78s)]
*  treated with respect at international events and organizations or anything like that. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=1997.3s)]
*  Israel is that. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=2003.14s)]
*  Israel wants to be considered a respectable first world country and we should hold them [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=2004.42s)]
*  to first world standards. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z14stx5Rf14&t=2010.1000000000001s)]
