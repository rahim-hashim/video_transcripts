# INSANE New York Speech Crackdown Shields ISRAEL ONLY
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps)
*  There are a lot of conservatives and people on the right who have been waving the free [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=0.0s)]
*  speech banner for many years and they still continue to do so on the one hand even as [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=9.4s)]
*  on the other. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=13.52s)]
*  Many of them by no means all but many of them continue to cheer for and support or at best [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  just overlook and acquiesce some of the gravest assaults on free speech that have been imposed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=20.6s)]
*  in the West ever that all have the sole singular objective of shielding this foreign government [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=27.62s)]
*  on the other side of the world called Israel from criticism or activism even though it's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=36.02s)]
*  our constitutional right both to criticize and engage in protest against them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=39.900000000000006s)]
*  We have detailed over and over every kind of example from the House's support of and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=45.3s)]
*  implementation of the so-called Combating Anti-Semitism Act that's designed to codify [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=50.22s)]
*  a very broad definition of anti-Semitism for purposes of education and discrimination [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=57.46s)]
*  law that basically make it illegal to say all sorts of things about Israel or American [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=61.78s)]
*  Jews that people have been saying for forever. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=67.42s)]
*  Ron DeSantis in Florida tried to ban, did ban pro-Palestinian groups on the grounds [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=72.58s)]
*  that they were providing quote material support for terrorism even though the only thing that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=77.7s)]
*  he ever claimed they did was criticize the Israeli war in Gaza and obviously material [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=81.42s)]
*  support for terrorism can't be composed of only speech and yet he ordered the pro-Palestinian [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  groups banned from all campuses. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=92.9s)]
*  In Texas, Governor Abbott who has a long history of implementing laws that are designed to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=95.5s)]
*  punish critics of Israel issued an executive order banning anti-Semitism in Texas and according [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=102.66s)]
*  to that executive order promising that the police would be deployed in the event that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=110.32s)]
*  there are protests against Israel and that's exactly what he then proceeded to do. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=115.0s)]
*  There have been scores of people in media and Hollywood and journalism and politics [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=118.96s)]
*  and academia fired for no reason other than signing anti-Israel petitions or pro-Palestinian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=124.06s)]
*  petitions or making pro-Palestinian statements. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=129.76s)]
*  It's been a systematic effort both legally and constitutionally to erode free speech [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=133.92s)]
*  and in terms of our values to destroy the ability of people to speak freely solely to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  protect this tiny little country on the other side of the world who in the United States [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=145.04s)]
*  for whatever reason continues to fund fully and arm and isolate itself from the rest of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=148.27999999999997s)]
*  the world to protect even though millions of its citizens live at a higher standard [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  of living than millions of ours do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  We have two late examples, recent examples just to give you a sense for how this is continuing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=160.44s)]
*  to escalate politicians and all sorts of pro-Israel fanatics constantly trying to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=165.2s)]
*  find new ways to punish people who criticize that one foreign government. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=169.72s)]
*  In the New York State Senate, a new bill entitled Senate Bill S531 was introduced and essentially, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=175.0s)]
*  well, I'll just read the summary that the sponsors wrote, quote, this bill will enact [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=184.48s)]
*  the New York State Anti-Semitism Vandalism Act, which establishes the crime of vandalism [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=189.24s)]
*  of pro-Israel print. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=196.24s)]
*  Let's just, if someone can give me that highlighter because I want to, I mean you see it highlighted [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=198.0s)]
*  there in green already, but I just like yellow, so let's make it green and yellow. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=203.5s)]
*  It establishes the crime of vandalism of pro-Israel print, which provides a class A misdemeanor [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=211.44s)]
*  for anyone, any individual who intentionally destroys, damages, removes, or causes to be [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=217.16s)]
*  destroyed, damaged, or removed any banner, poster, flyer, or billboard, which is located [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=222.28s)]
*  in a public space where the intent or purpose of such banner, poster, flyer, or billboard [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=228.56s)]
*  is to bring awareness for Israeli individuals who have been victims of a crime. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=233.24s)]
*  So this bill is only about the destruction or removal or vandalization of billboards [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=239.6s)]
*  or posters that are designed to bring awareness for Israeli individuals who have been victims [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=247.12s)]
*  of a crime or to positively support the country or citizens of Israel in any way. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=251.92s)]
*  That's the bill. So let me just explain this. If you put up a bill, a poster, that supports [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=259.76s)]
*  Ukraine, or supports Canada, or Norway, or Korea, or Uruguay, or any other country in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=266.76s)]
*  the world, including your own, the United States, and somebody comes and tears it down [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=274.76s)]
*  or vandalizes it or makes some attempt to destroy it or causes someone else to do so, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=280.76s)]
*  that is not a crime under this law, under this bill. There's only one type of speech [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=286.76s)]
*  this law is intended to protect, which is speech that is designed to bring awareness [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=292.76s)]
*  for Israeli individuals, not for American individuals. If you put a poster up saying, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=298.68s)]
*  here are American citizens who are being mistreated, who have been victimized, and someone comes [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=304.32s)]
*  and tears it down, that is not a crime under this bill. It is only a crime under this bill [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=308.56s)]
*  if the poster in question is designed to bring awareness about Israeli individuals or to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  positively support the country of Israel or the citizens of Israel in any way. You could [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  put a poster up saying, the United States is the greatest country in the world, we are [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  so happy that we have such great leaders, American citizens deserve better, someone [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=333.88s)]
*  comes and tears it down or vandalizes it, that's not a crime. Nor is it a crime if it's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=340.11999999999995s)]
*  about any other country or any citizen of other countries, only if it's about Israeli [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=345.4s)]
*  citizens or it's designed to support or positively support the country or the citizens of Israel [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  in any way. That's the only time it becomes a crime in the state of New York, which is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=356.2s)]
*  about 7,000 miles away from the country it's designed to protect. Here is section 3, subdivision [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=363.2s)]
*  7 of section 693, which says that section that I just cited of the education law is [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=371.92s)]
*  amended by adding a new paragraph, A1, to read as follows. A1, this is adding to an [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=378.92s)]
*  existing law, quote, not withstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the corporation [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=385.56s)]
*  shall be entitled to garnish the disposable pay of an individual to collect the amount [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=391.2s)]
*  owed by the individual if such individual is found guilty of anti-Semitism by any administrative [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=397.08s)]
*  tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction, including in a disciplinary proceeding brought [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=403.32s)]
*  by a higher education institution. So remember I just got done saying that the House has [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=407.24s)]
*  implemented the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act designed to radically expand the kinds of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=414.44s)]
*  statements you might express about Israel or Jews that now become illegal in the educational [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=421.44s)]
*  system and this bill is saying if you are found guilty of that, a corporation can garnish [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=429.6s)]
*  your wages or take other enforcement action against you as punishment for anti-Semitic [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=435.2s)]
*  speech, not for anti-black racist speech, not for xenophobic speech, not for misogynistic [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=440.88s)]
*  speech, not for homophobic speech, not for transphobic speech, not for Islamophobia, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=446.6s)]
*  not for hateful acts or statements against white people or Christians, only against Jews [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=454.32s)]
*  or the state of Israel. It's a special crime exclusively for people who express that kind [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=462.84s)]
*  of view and that should be shocking but at this point it just isn't. It's not even remotely [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=469.44s)]
*  shocking anymore because that has become the ethos in the United States and it's been this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=476.56s)]
*  way for a long time. Thanks for watching this clip from System Update, our live show that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dao4rgXWbps&t=486.28s)]
