# Trump VS Federal Judges: The Clash Over Deportation Due Process
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ)
*  This case was appealed, that decision was appealed by the Trump Justice Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to the DC Court of Appeals. We have 13 different appellate courts in the United States. The DC [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Court of Appeals is for DC. It typically rules on federal government action. It's considered the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=25.48s)]
*  most prestigious court of all the Court of Appeals courts right below the Supreme Court. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=31.48s)]
*  There's more betting for this court than any other and of the three judges who sat on the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  panel, one of them was a Trump appointee, Justin Walker. Now I've attended a lot of oral arguments, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=43.36s)]
*  I've participated in a lot of oral arguments as a lawyer, I've covered a lot of oral arguments [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=51.52s)]
*  as a journalist, and honestly, I'm being serious here, I don't recall an oral argument where the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=58.32s)]
*  judges on the panel were so blatantly and glaringly opposed to everything the government lawyers were [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=66.72s)]
*  saying. Oftentimes they'll try and ask tough questions for each side, a lot of times you walk [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=75.44s)]
*  away not really knowing how they're going to rule. Sometimes you walk away knowing how they're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  going to rule because they were somewhat more assertive with one side than the other. In this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=87.52s)]
*  hearing, they just badgered the DOJ lawyer, essentially rejecting aggressively everything [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=91.12s)]
*  that he was saying. And then when the plaintiff's lawyers, the immigrants lawyers from the ACLU and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=98.2s)]
*  elsewhere stood up to speak, they basically kept saying, we already agree with you, you don't really [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  need to keep saying this. Here is just one of the exchanges courtesy of C-SPAN which broadcasts the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=111.2s)]
*  hearing, that's where I listened to it, of this Trump appointee, Justin Walker, as he essentially [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=117.04s)]
*  sides with the Venezuelans about the rate of due process. And by the way, this is the lawyer for, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=125.52s)]
*  one of the lawyers for the Venezuelan immigrants who are describing why due process is so urgent [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=137.72s)]
*  here, and then you'll hear the judge interject. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=143.28s)]
*  The president of El Salvador has now said maybe they're going to spend the rest of their lives there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=156.52s)]
*  The government has provided zero ability to bring habeas. The implications of not giving people a chance [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  to contest it are extraordinary. I mean, every religious and ethnic group in this country has at some [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  point been tagged as associated with a criminal organization. If people can just be picked up and sent... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=175.8s)]
*  Mr. Glerin, I mean, I just have to stop you. You're not getting an argument from this bench so far today [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=182.64s)]
*  against the idea that every single member of this class can have an individualized habeas determination [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=187.76s)]
*  in front of an Article III judge to say, I'm innocent. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  But it's really an extraordinary thing that's happening because people were rushed out, as Judge Boasberg [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  said, and story after story is now coming out that people had nothing to do with the gang. And so I think [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=202.76s)]
*  we're looking at people now who may be in El Salvador in prison the rest of their lives. And I think that's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=209.76s)]
*  really the problem. And in comunicado, families can't reach them. There's no way to reach them, and the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=214.72s)]
*  government wants to continue doing it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=220.04s)]
*  This is what I mean. You hear what he said, the judge. This is the crux of the case. Their only argument is, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  look, we don't dispute the government's right to deport people in the country illegally. We don't even dispute [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=232.88s)]
*  their right to imprison people if they're part of a criminal gang or an organization designated as a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=241.32s)]
*  terrorist organization. What we're arguing is that the people accused, before they get thrown away into a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=249.24s)]
*  foreign country and disappeared forever in one of the worst prison systems in the world for life or indefinitely, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=256.28s)]
*  has to have the right before they're put there to appeal to a court and say, we want a hearing to demonstrate [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=264.32s)]
*  that the accusation against us that we belong to this gang is false. And the judge on the panel, who's a Trump [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=273.32s)]
*  appointee, interjected and said, I don't know why you keep talking about this, because there's no dispute from this bench [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  that every single person that they propose to deport to El Salvador has the right to an Article III hearing before [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  they're deported where the evidence has to be considered. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  And just as one reminder, you know, I sometimes, and this is what I find frustrating, to be honest, about the first two months of the Trump [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  administration, is it was a, it's a common claim within the MAGA movement that Bush and Cheney were terrible, that administration [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  was terrible and destructive, the war on terror was wrong and bad, that civil liberties are vital. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=326.16s)]
*  This, what the Trump administration is doing was the crux of the war on terror assault on civil liberties under Bush and Cheney. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=335.68s)]
*  The argument of Bush and Cheney was that we have the power, because we're in a war called the war on terror, to unilaterally and with no [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  review designate people, even American citizens, as terrorists or enemy combatants. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  And once we do that, we can do anything we want to them with no judicial review. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=357.48s)]
*  We can torture them, we can kidnap them off the streets of Europe and render them, ship them to Syria and Egypt to be tortured. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  We can put them in prison in Guantanamo for life. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  We can claim the right to spy on American citizens as long as we think it advances our interest in terms of battling terrorism. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=373.04s)]
*  And when there were Patriot Act controversies or Guantanamo controversies, the argument of the government was, look, you just trust us. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=379.92s)]
*  We have done a very thorough job of determining who these people are. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=390.64s)]
*  We know they're terrorists. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=394.72s)]
*  In fact, in Guantanamo, every person in Guantanamo, we were able to find out who these people were. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=396.24s)]
*  Every person in Guantanamo, we were told, was not just a terrorist, but quote, the worst of the worst. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  And at the time, there were in excess of a thousand detainees in Guantanamo. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=408.76s)]
*  Now there are fewer than 30. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  Because the government over 18 years realized that these people are not threats. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=416.8s)]
*  They have never been associated with terrorist organizations. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=421.0s)]
*  A lot of them were picked up based on bad intelligence or deliberate vindictive reporting to the U.S. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=425.0s)]
*  military that somebody was or just mistaken identity. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=430.6s)]
*  And it was only once the Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that they have an entitlement to a hearing, a habeas corpus hearing under the Constitution, even though they're not citizens and even though they're being held in Guantanamo. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=434.24s)]
*  And they started to prove that a lot of them did, that there was no evidence against them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  We learned this lesson already. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  We should have learned it decades ago, even before that, that you don't trust the executive branch, the federal government to say, we'll decide who's guilty. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  You don't need to see any of the evidence. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=460.08s)]
*  They don't need any opportunity. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=461.44s)]
*  They can test it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=462.4s)]
*  We're good people. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=462.96s)]
*  Trust us to do it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  That's not the American system. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=464.8s)]
*  That's not an American value. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=466.8s)]
*  It never has been. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=468.76s)]
*  Here's Patricia Millet, who was also on the panel. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=472.12s)]
*  She's an Obama appointee. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=476.68s)]
*  She was very active in this oral argument. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=478.96s)]
*  I mean, again, just like badgering the DOJ lawyer, but in a way that the Trump appointee agreed with as well. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=482.32s)]
*  And we'll just show you a couple of clips of that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  But second, I think that the procedural one still challenges fundamentally in core habeas. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=491.92s)]
*  It says you may not do anything to me under the AEA until you satisfy these preconditions. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  You are utterly without power to do so. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=503.36s)]
*  I mean, that is the same sort of core habeas as asserting that a conviction is wrong because procedural requirements in a trial were not followed. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  Not though. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=515.64s)]
*  I don't think that's the same at all because people don't go through a trial in this country without getting the gold standard of due process. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  And that was not happening here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=522.44s)]
*  I think that's a false equation. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=525.16s)]
*  The problem here is that they are challenging implementation, the proclamation in a way that never gave anyone a chance to say, I'm not covered. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=527.44s)]
*  And if your argument is. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=544.32s)]
*  He didn't have to do that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=548.32s)]
*  It's an intrusion on the president's war powers. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=550.32s)]
*  The courts are paralyzed to do anything. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=552.32s)]
*  Then that's a misreading of precedent. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=556.32s)]
*  It's a misreading of the text of the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=559.32s)]
*  And that can't be an unlawful intrusion on the president's powers. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=564.32s)]
*  You just can't. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=569.32s)]
*  The president has to comply with the Constitution and laws like everybody else. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=571.32s)]
*  On that we certainly agree, Your Honor. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=577.32s)]
*  I think that what is. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=579.32s)]
*  I mean, just by the way. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=582.32s)]
*  Last week. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=586.32s)]
*  My friends Sager and Jetty and Crystal Wall, the co-host of Breaking Points, had a quite vociferous debate twice in fact about this issue with Crystal arguing against these deportations to El Salvador and Sager arguing in favor. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=589.32s)]
*  I listened to both. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=607.32s)]
*  I went and talked to Sager and explained to him my reasons why I thought he was wrong and to his immense credit. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=608.32s)]
*  Asked me to come on the show, Crystal's office week on vacation, where I could basically yell at him and tell him why he's wrong. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=614.32s)]
*  And he actually during the conversation we had even before this was starting to say, you know what, maybe I'm being convinced. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=624.32s)]
*  I'm understanding these arguments better now. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=630.32s)]
*  He kind of said, I'm very emotional about illegal immigration like a lot of people are. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=633.32s)]
*  And I just want the problem solved. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=637.32s)]
*  But it is true. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=639.32s)]
*  We can't violate the Constitution or basically your process of rights to do it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=640.32s)]
*  And to his great credit, he invited me on the playful title that Breaking Points put up was Glenn Greenwald's school Sager on deportation. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=644.32s)]
*  A lot of people thought that that was the staff passive aggressively rebelling against Sager. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=654.32s)]
*  In fact, he was the one who wrote it, knowing that that it would bring a lot of traffic to the segment. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=659.32s)]
*  But we did hash it out. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=665.32s)]
*  Ryan Grim was there as well for about 25 minutes and kind of at the end Sager said, you know what, I feel like I'm probably wrong on this issue. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=666.32s)]
*  I'm starting to understand why this can't be that you can just throw people into an El Salvadoran prison with no opportunity for them to say that I've been wrongly accused of being part of a drug gang. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=673.32s)]
*  Otherwise, you could just pick up anybody. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=685.32s)]
*  The president could. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=687.32s)]
*  Anyway, I recommend that talking points debate I did earlier today because a lot of these issues are really hashed out. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=688.32s)]
*  Here's the third segment I want to show you from the hearing because I want to just explain this one point. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=697.32s)]
*  The only reason that the Trump administration argues that they can ship people out of the country with no due process is because they have declared war. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=705.32s)]
*  They claim that the United States is under attack, that it's a war like World War One or World War Two or the 1812 war, which were the only three times in history that the Alien Enemies Act on which the Trump administration was is relying was actually invoked for real wars. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=717.32s)]
*  Like when the United States was really at war and they needed during World War Two, for example, to expel people they thought were Nazi sympathizers or sympathizers with Japan. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=733.32s)]
*  This was the statute that led FDR to claim the power to imprison Japanese Americans in internment camps with no evidence of wrongdoing just based on the belief that if they were Japanese in ancestry, they would have more loyalty to Japan than to the United States. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=746.32s)]
*  So is it a very extreme law? And there's a lot of questions about are we actually at war with Trinidad and Aragua? Is that a criminal problem? It sounds like a criminal problem. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=765.32s)]
*  Usually you go to war with nation states, not with drug gangs. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=775.32s)]
*  But even when we were in World War Two and World War One in the 1812 war and the government claimed the right to expel people who were foreign threats, even they got hearings. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=780.32s)]
*  If someone was a suspected Nazi sympathizer or Nazi operative before they got expelled from the country, they had a hearing to prove that they were mistreated exactly what the Trump administration refuses to give people today. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=796.32s)]
*  And here's what Judge Millett said about that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=811.32s)]
*  Your honor, I think that this course decision IM versus CBP is instructive on this. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=814.32s)]
*  Am I wrong about anything I just said factually? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=821.32s)]
*  Your honor, I think it's incorrect that they couldn't have gotten into court as the five individual plaintiffs. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=824.32s)]
*  No, but the point here was that there were plain loads of people. I mean, it was also a class action. There were plain loads of people. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=829.32s)]
*  There were no procedures in place to notify people. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=837.32s)]
*  Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemy Act and has happened here where the proclamation required the promulgation of regulations and they had hearing boards before people were removed. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=842.32s)]
*  And yet here there's no there's nothing in there about hearing boards. There's no regulations and nothing was adopted by the agency officials that were administering this. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=855.32s)]
*  People weren't given notice. They weren't told where they were going. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=864.32s)]
*  They were given those people on those planes on that Saturday had no opportunity to file habeas or any type of action to challenge the removal under the A.E.A. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=867.32s)]
*  And you've agreed that two of those airplanes, people were removed under the A.E.A. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=879.32s)]
*  Is that so you kind of get a sense for how rough the Trump Justice Department lawyers had it at oral argument today. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=885.32s)]
*  Like I said, I've never seen such a one sided such a one sided oral argument before. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=894.32s)]
*  There are now these issues going to the Supreme Court. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=904.32s)]
*  The officer of the office of the Solicitor General, which is the office that argues for the U.S. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=908.32s)]
*  government before the Supreme Court has appealed to the Supreme Court on the question of a district court injunction in the Northern District of California that regards whether the Trump administration has the right to fire certain. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=914.32s)]
*  Government employees who are had been protected statutor statutorily with the right not to be fired without just cause and the Solicitor General in appealing directly to the Supreme Court not going to the appeals court says quote the lower court should not be allowed to transform themselves into all purpose overseers of executive branch hiring firing contracting and policy making. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=932.32s)]
*  Only this court could end the inter branch power grab. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=953.32s)]
*  Now I see a lot of Trump supporters arguing that district court judges should not have the power to make decisions that bind the entire federal government the president the executive branch nobody elected them etc etc. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=959.32s)]
*  And like I said earlier the Trump supporters the conservative movement frequently went into federal court under every Democratic administration for decades including Joe Biden's and asked a single federal judge in a single federal court district to enjoin to to stop. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=973.32s)]
*  Biden policy not for just one district but for the entire country and they often succeeded in getting it no conservative back then ever said oh federal district judge don't have the right to stop. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=996.32s)]
*  U.S. government policy. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1009.32s)]
*  Because again if you want to sue the U.S. government and get an injunction stop them from doing something you believe is legal illegal or unconstitutional you have to go to a federal district court that's the only one that can rule in the first instance and the solution at the government is to stop. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1012.32s)]
*  The only way the government thinks that the injunction is wrong is not to ignore it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1026.32s)]
*  But to appeal to the appellate court than the Supreme Court that's how the rule of law functions. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1032.32s)]
*  Here are a few examples from the. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1038.32s)]
*  This is beyond data and democracy headline. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1045.32s)]
*  Actually this is a little bit different. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1048.32s)]
*  This is there's this other narrative that the judges who are ruling against the Trump administration are all left wing judges. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1051.32s)]
*  They're all leftists carrying out a political agenda and a political war against Trump. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1060.32s)]
*  So this is the on data and democracy which compiled data that reveals a cross ideological judicial opposition to the Trump administration. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1065.32s)]
*  And they have both liberal and conservative judges are ruling against Trump two of the four judges targeted for impeachment are actually right of center. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1074.32s)]
*  And you can kind of see here that they have the conservatives over here and the liberals over here and the center the kind of center over here. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1085.32s)]
*  And it's also for Trump and against Trump and you see a lot of these people for Trump here conservatives for Trump who have been ruling against him. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1094.32s)]
*  And you see Judge Boasberg who again is being called a far leftist even though his judicial history doesn't remotely suggest anything like that. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1104.32s)]
*  Other judges as well who are more to the conservative side and then you can really see it here where. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1113.32s)]
*  Where. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1119.32s)]
*  This is the percentage ruling against Trump by judicial ideology and it's 76 percent for liberal judges or Democrats 88 percent for centrist judges and even 50 percent for conservative judges. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1121.32s)]
*  So this is by no means a far left attack on the Trump administration. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1137.32s)]
*  This is something which the judiciary is reacting to remember the Trump administration the Trump movement and this is part of what I liked about it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1142.32s)]
*  Val that they were going to go in and completely break the way things are being done. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1153.32s)]
*  So it is I think expected. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1158.32s)]
*  That. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1163.32s)]
*  Judges are going to be giving more scrutiny to brand new ways of doing things. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1166.32s)]
*  One of the cases that conservatives ended up getting a federal district court judge court to stop was Biden's plans to cancel student loans. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1172.32s)]
*  Something he was being pressured to do by the Democratic Party base and instead of getting Congress to do it he issued an executive order argued he had the power to do so. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1183.32s)]
*  Even though when Biden refused to do it for years Nancy Pelosi said he doesn't have that power only Congress can do it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1192.32s)]
*  Biden did it because he wanted to give his base a kind of political present heading into the election and conservatives ran into a federal court. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1198.32s)]
*  Just a federal normal federal district court judge and said Biden's student loan cancellation policy is illegal. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1208.32s)]
*  It exceeds his power as a president and they got a federal federal court judge a lower court judge to enjoin to stop the policy for the entire country. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1216.32s)]
*  They overrode the president's policy. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1227.32s)]
*  Here is Donald Trump in a video on true social in September of 2024 celebrating that ruling. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1229.32s)]
*  Joe Biden was just rejected with his hoax from trying to get student loans paid off or go away or whatever. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1234.32s)]
*  It was total rejection. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1245.32s)]
*  They laughed at him. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1247.32s)]
*  He's a stupid man but he doesn't care because he's not running. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1249.32s)]
*  So that was one example. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1252.32s)]
*  Here David Sacks who I know very well and have a lot of respect for he's been a very knowledgeable and important and influential opponent of the war in Ukraine among other things. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1254.32s)]
*  I think he's been really influenced by a lot of the voices that we have on our show Professor Mearsheimer and that kind of realist school that is opposed to intervention. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1267.32s)]
*  But he is now part of the Trump administration. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1276.32s)]
*  He's Trump's czar for crypto and artificial intelligence and he said this on X earlier today. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1279.32s)]
*  Quote there are over 600 district court judges in the US roughly half appointed by Democrats and half Republicans. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1290.32s)]
*  Obviously the whole system breaks down if it only takes one to invalidate any executive branch action. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1296.32s)]
*  I just told you Trump celebrating a federal district court judge doing exactly that and validating the executive branch action. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1303.32s)]
*  But remember the case that we talked about a lot where the Biden administration was coercing and pressuring big tech to censor dissent on a whole range of issues including covid. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1311.32s)]
*  And the Biden administration lost in the federal court district court level. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1328.32s)]
*  Conservative attorneys general for Missouri and Louisiana went and ensued the Biden administration and asked the federal district court judge to enjoin that program and join the government from doing what they were doing with coercing big tech. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1334.32s)]
*  And David Sacks the same David Sacks just said the government would collapse if federal district court judges can override executive policy the country would fall apart was celebrating this. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1347.32s)]
*  Because like myself he found the censorship regime to be so offensive to the Constitution and American values. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1362.32s)]
*  Here's what he posted on X in July of 2023 quote a US district court has ruled that parts of the government including FBI and HHS cannot urge encourage pressure or induce social media sites to remove content containing protected free speech a much needed decision happy July 4th. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1368.32s)]
*  Conservatives constantly got federal district court judges to enjoin democratic administrations. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1390.32s)]
*  Here's Charlie Kirk today. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1395.32s)]
*  I'm sorry this Charlie Kirk earlier this month speaking on Laura Ingram's program about why he believes the United States now faces a constitutional crisis. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1398.32s)]
*  So you have these district court judges usually Charlie selected in areas where they in they know there's a disproportionate number of Democrat appointees so they'll go to the First Circuit go to Boston or Connecticut or DC or out in the Pacific Northwest and they'll find you know they'll find a friendly judge and then that judge is okay the president has no authority. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1409.32s)]
*  I mean that's just ludicrous so the administration has to go directly to the Supreme Court on that question and there's a process for doing that. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1431.32s)]
*  But the DOJ and the Solicitor General's office has to push against these nationwide injunctions because I think that's really going to be the only weapon in the first two years that the Democrats can deploy here. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1441.32s)]
*  It's the it's the only weapon and it is the strategy of trying to run out the clock they're trying to flood the zone with so many nationwide injunctions that the Supreme Court cannot practically actually be able to rule on all these cases. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1453.32s)]
*  If there's a hundred or two hundred sweeping nationwide injunctions maybe half of them will end up being heard by the US Supreme Court. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1465.32s)]
*  This is a run out the clock strategy that they tried during the first Trump administration and so Senate Republicans they needed to get very wise about the new litmus test when they ask these new judges that come up for hearing do you believe that this is okay? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1471.32s)]
*  Now again this is how our system has worked for many many decades more than a century. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1485.32s)]
*  Federal District Court judges are the court of first instance when you sue the government and they have always had the power to issue injunctions. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1497.32s)]
*  They issue injunctions against acts that are illegal or violated by the Constitution. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1506.32s)]
*  Conservatives have used that tactic as much as liberals. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1509.32s)]
*  This is not a left-wing tactic and it is true that there are more injunctions against the Trump administration but that's because the Trump administration came in extremely well prepared extremely well prepared to issue an immense amount of executive orders from the Trump White House to implement the agenda that they had wanted to implement. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1513.32s)]
*  And usually presidents get into office and like I said they tend to be interested in the continuity of the status quo and so you don't get anywhere near the number of executive orders. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1539.32s)]
*  Charlie Kirk used the phrase flooding the zone for these lawsuits. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1553.32s)]
*  That's what liberals have been calling Trump's strategy flood the zone with so many executive orders that you can't keep track of them. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1556.32s)]
*  So that's the reason there's it's a reaction it's an action and a reaction. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1562.32s)]
*  Here was Charlie Kirk that was Charlie Kirk saying we have to put a stop to the federal district court judges. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1568.32s)]
*  In joining our whole government nationwide here he was on July in July of twenty twenty three reacting to the federal district courts injunction of the pressuring of the big tech companies by the Biden administration and Charlie Kirk said quote instead of simply reporting the facts that a federal judge just delivered a blockbuster injunction in Missouri versus Biden. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1575.32s)]
*  Blocking this administration from outsourcing its censorship regime to social media companies the New York Times spins it as quote a ruling that could curtail efforts to fight disinformation pure propaganda. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1597.32s)]
*  I totally agree with Charlie Kirk's tweet there I covered that New York Times framing. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1610.32s)]
*  I completely agree I celebrated that federal court injunction because federal courts have the power to enjoy the government nationwide. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1615.32s)]
*  The Biden administration appealed that ruling to the appellate court they also lost in the appellate court the appellate court said by a three to zero decision this is one of the worst assault on the first amendment we've seen and the government remains enjoying from doing this and then they appealed at the Supreme Court that Biden administration won mostly on quasi procedural rounds. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1624.32s)]
*  That's the way the court system works and it always has here from the top of the Smith law firm in November of twenty twenty four quote federal court permanently enjoins Biden parole in place program for undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens.

*  The USCIS announces that it will cease to accept and process applications under this program so the Biden administration put in a program for undocumented spouses and children. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1665.32s)]
*  Conservatives ran into federal court said it was unconstitutional and illegal the federal district court said it was the Biden administration says okay we're going to stop the program. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1676.32s)]
*  Here from the Washington Post June of twenty twenty four courts grant injunction against Biden student loan repayment plan judges in Kansas and Missouri issued rulings Monday preventing the government from fully implementing and forgiving any more loans through the same program and that of course was a federal district court judge Trump. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1684.32s)]
*  Did that video celebrating it here from September of twenty twenty three Phelps Dunbar LLC the law firm issued a release Texas district court judge enjoins President Biden's fifteen dollar minimum wage for federal contractors order so the government wanted to implement a policy that if you want to have a contract with the federal government there's a requirement of a fifteen dollar minimum wage. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1703.32s)]
*  The conservatives ran into a federal court got a single federal district court judge and that's the way the federal district court judges are going to be doing this. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1716.32s)]
*  Here from the law firm Sidley in Austin August twenty twenty two U.S. district court enjoins the Biden administration's nationwide oil and gas leasing pause following the Fifth Circuit remand so the Biden administration based on the promise that they made during the campaign wanted to pause oil drilling and gas leasing. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1725.32s)]
*  And conservatives ran into a federal court a single district court judge got persuaded to issue a nationwide injunction stopping Biden from doing so every conservative celebrated nobody said what do you mean a federal district court judge can issue a nationwide injunction stopping the government from doing so. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1741.32s)]
*  Yes everyone understands that's how it's always worked. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1750.32s)]
*  I understand there are more such injunctions now but that's because there are more Trump executive orders that are being issued by the federal government. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1754.32s)]
*  And that's the way the federal district court judges are going to be doing this. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1761.32s)]
*  So the federal district court judges are going to be doing this. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1765.32s)]
*  And that's the way the federal district court judges are going to be doing this. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1768.32s)]
*  And that's the way the federal district court judges are going to be doing this. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1772.32s)]
*  And that's the way the federal district court judges are going to be doing this. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1776.32s)]
*  And that's the way the federal district court judges are going to be doing this. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1780.32s)]

*  And that's the way the federal district court judges are going to be doing this. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1788.32s)]
*  The principle though is cannot be challenged. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1791.32s)]
*  Of course a federal district court judge has the right to issue nationwide injunctions stopping a presidential policy. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1793.32s)]
*  They always have had that power. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1798.32s)]
*  Both sides have used that power and celebrated it repeatedly. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1800.32s)]
*  And now suddenly they want to create a new principle that federal district court judges should not have this power because it's Donald Trump now in office and they don't want to see him constrained in any way. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1803.32s)]
*  That is anything but a principled or a constitutional based argument. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAyLFc5nBsQ&t=1815.32s)]
