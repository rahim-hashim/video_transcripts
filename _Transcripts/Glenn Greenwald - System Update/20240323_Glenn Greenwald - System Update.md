# Candace Owens Out at Daily Wire Over Israel Criticism
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II)
*  Kandace Owens is one of the most influential and popular political commentators in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=0.0s)]
*  United States. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=12.24s)]
*  Her podcast is listened to literally by millions of people, millions more listen on YouTube. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=13.24s)]
*  And ever since 2020 or 2021, she has done her work as a member of an employee of the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=17.78s)]
*  right wing website, the Daily Wire. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=25.16s)]
*  The Daily Wire is itself one of the great success stories, at least from a business [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=27.64s)]
*  perspective when it comes to new media. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  It's a company that was formed in 2015 by the right wing pro-Israel commentator Ben [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=35.2s)]
*  Shapiro and by a longtime conservative filmmaker on Hollywood, Jeremy Boring. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=40.6s)]
*  It doesn't exactly have a scrappy startup story. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  It was created with the investments of a right wing billionaire that gave them tens of millions, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  if not more, of startup cash that then converted into a very successful site. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=55.36s)]
*  Although the key to its success was that for whatever reason, it was able to reach an agreement [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=60.88s)]
*  with Facebook where the shows that were on the Daily Wire, especially Ben Shapiro, ended [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=66.72s)]
*  up being aggressively promoted by the Facebook algorithm in a way that spread the Daily Wire [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=72.4s)]
*  show far more pervasively than almost any other program on Facebook. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=79.44s)]
*  And as a result of that, and there were meetings between Ben Shapiro and Mark Zuckerberg that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  were widely reported, though Daily Wire became a true new media behemoth that has an audience [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  that competes with the size of a lot of established media outlets. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=95.62s)]
*  And Ben Shapiro himself and the Daily Wire was created based on an ethos that has become [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=99.64s)]
*  extremely not only popular, but very lucrative among American conservatives, among people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  who brand themselves as heterodox, which is that they believe in free speech. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=111.38s)]
*  They believe in free discourse. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=116.38s)]
*  They oppose cancel culture. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  They dislike the weaponization of racism accusations against people who disagree with them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=121.46s)]
*  They believe that the solution to people who disagree with you is not to scream bigot at [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=126.82s)]
*  them, not to fire them, not to silence them, but to engage them in debate. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=130.62s)]
*  All these very moving and inspiring and virtuous values that Ben Shapiro and the Daily Wire [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=134.34s)]
*  have embraced and branded themselves as defending to the great profit of those who founded that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=140.22s)]
*  organization. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  Starting on October 7th, that model that's very easy to champion, as long as most of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  the people within your organization are people who agree with you on most of the issues about [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=154.38s)]
*  which you care most began to be quite strained and tested by virtue of the fact that rather [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=157.98s)]
*  than having a lot of agreements, suddenly they began to have disagreement not on ancillary [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=165.06s)]
*  issues, but on the issues about which Ben Shapiro cares most, namely the issue of Israel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=170.14s)]
*  After October 7th, Ben Shapiro became probably the most histrionic and emotional and aggressive [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=176.7s)]
*  voice in not only defending every last thing this foreign country does. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=183.17999999999998s)]
*  He obviously has a lot of roots in this foreign country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=188.5s)]
*  He was in Israel on the day before October 7th. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=190.5s)]
*  His family members, I believe his wife is Israeli. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=195.5s)]
*  He has real estate in Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=198.5s)]
*  He's been asked before why he doesn't move to Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  And he said because he thinks he can do more for Israel by remaining in the United States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  And clearly, Ben Shapiro is part of his mission. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't think this is controversial to say. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  It's to try and convince American citizens to love and support Israel as much as Ben Shapiro [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=212.22s)]
*  and try and make sure that Americans continue to believe that the United States should finance [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=216.7s)]
*  Israel's military, should finance its wars. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=220.7s)]
*  This is a major part of Ben Shapiro's life mission. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=223.7s)]
*  He's a religious Jew and he has talked many times about the importance of Israel not only [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=227.7s)]
*  to his religion, but to his politics and his identity. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=232.7s)]
*  It's probably the issue about which he cares most, certainly one of the top two or three. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=235.7s)]
*  And then after October 7th, Candace Owens, who is one of the very few people at the Daily [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=240.17999999999998s)]
*  Wire or even on the American Right to compete with Ben Shapiro in terms of influence and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=245.17999999999998s)]
*  the size of platform, began taking a much different view. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=250.17999999999998s)]
*  She began questioning why it is that we would stand by and watch Israel destroy all of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=253.17999999999998s)]
*  civilian infrastructure of Gaza and kill huge numbers of innocent Palestinians and accept [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=260.18s)]
*  that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=267.66s)]
*  And even more so, she was wondering frequently why is it that the United States is supposed [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=268.66s)]
*  to pay for the military and the wars of Israel, which is a question that if you are somebody [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=273.66s)]
*  who has embraced the America First ideology or who in general has adopted a view when [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=280.66s)]
*  it comes to Ukraine that we shouldn't be financing the war in Ukraine because we have enough [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=286.66s)]
*  of our problems here at home or we're too in debt here at home in order to pay for foreign [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=289.66s)]
*  wars would be an obvious question. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=293.66s)]
*  And yet we have been documenting many times since October 7th that not only is that not [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  a question that's permissible in right wing discourse, a lot of people have been fired [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=300.14000000000004s)]
*  for saying things like that, a lot of people have been censored for saying it, a lot of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=304.14000000000004s)]
*  student groups have been closed for defending the Palestinian cause, and obviously the main [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=308.14000000000004s)]
*  tactic that is used by the pro-Israel sector of the American Right against Israel critics [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=313.14000000000004s)]
*  and this has always been true, is to scream racism and bigotry, specifically against the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  people who are the critics of the state of Israel or who question US support for Israel [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=324.62s)]
*  of being an anti-Semite. In fact, it is such an automatic tactic that there is literally [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=330.62s)]
*  nobody who has ever had a prominent platform in the United States who has harshly criticized [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=336.62s)]
*  Israel and or who has questioned why the United States should continue to fund Israel who [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=342.62s)]
*  has not been accused of being an anti-Semite, who has not been widely branded a bigot and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=350.1s)]
*  a racist as a result of those views. There are entire organizations that are very well [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=356.1s)]
*  funded like the ADL and APAC that exist to do so and over the last several months you [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=360.1s)]
*  could see an increasing attack on Candace Owens accusing her continuously of being anti-Semitic [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=365.1s)]
*  the more and more she questioned Israel, which is what happens to every person who takes [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=371.1s)]
*  those positions. Now earlier today, and this has been coming to a head for a long time, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=375.58000000000004s)]
*  Jeremy Boring who is the CEO of the Daily Wire and I should say that when the Daily [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=384.26000000000005s)]
*  Wire was created in 2015 as I said it was co-founded by Boring and by Ben Shapiro. Ben [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=388.98s)]
*  Shapiro was the editor in chief of the Daily Wire which meant that he ran the Daily Wire [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=392.98s)]
*  but he stopped doing that in 2020. He no longer was the editor in chief, technically he wasn't [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=397.82000000000005s)]
*  the editor in chief, but he was the CEO of the Daily Wire and he became the CEO of the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=402.56s)]
*  Daily Wire of Candace Owens Boss and Jeremy Boring came out today and said the following [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=406.06s)]
*  which is the Daily Wire and Candace Owens have ended their relationship. Now note that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=411.06s)]
*  he didn't say why. And I think it was very obvious to a lot of people, why? But I happen [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=416.06s)]
*  to know the reason as do a lot of other people based on reporting that I've done, based [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=422.06s)]
*  on people that I've spoken, based on people that I've spoken, based on people close to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=426.06s)]
*  and in particular Ben Shapiro concluded that Candace Owens' advocacy on Israel, her opposition [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=429.06s)]
*  to the war in Gaza, her questioning of the U.S. war in Israel, has crossed over into the line of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=435.62s)]
*  racism and therefore is a view with which the daily wire no longer wants to be associated. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=439.94s)]
*  Basically Ben Shapiro's parents and his family were being badgered to try and understand, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=446.74s)]
*  and there are a lot of rabbis saying this, like Rabbi Shmueli and Rabbi Barclay who accused [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=454.82s)]
*  Candace Owens of being anti-Semite and they were constantly saying why is it that Candace Owens [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=459.46s)]
*  is continuously employed at the daily wire? Here we have Rabbi Shmueli in a tweet and we went over [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=465.7s)]
*  this last week when we covered what we could see coming was the firing of Candace Owens over Israel. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=471.14s)]
*  Here you see how long would the daily wire stand by Candace Owens? That was Rabbi Shmueli. There [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=477.62s)]
*  was a lot of pressure being put on Ben Shapiro and the daily wire to get rid of this woman who [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=482.18s)]
*  is committing the crime of criticizing Israel and questioning the U.S. support for it. Here is the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=488.18s)]
*  Anti-Defamation League which basically exists to get people fired who are heretics on the issue of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=492.74s)]
*  Israel and they tweeted on March 21st, so this week, quote, white supremacists and Holocaust [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=499.3s)]
*  denier Nick Fuentes is praising Candace Owens' vitriolic anti-Semitism. It's hardly surprising [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=506.34s)]
*  but it does set off alarm bells when bigoted people come together to push an anti-Semitic agenda [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=513.14s)]
*  and adds fuel to the hate. Now this is just classic guilt by association. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=518.18s)]
*  In other words, Nick Fuentes, who the ADLS says is an anti-Semite and Holocaust denier, agrees with [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=526.42s)]
*  Candace Owens' critique of Israel and therefore that's supposed to be proof that Candace Owens is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=532.58s)]
*  an anti-Semite and a Holocaust denier and a neo-Nazi because otherwise why would a neo-Nazi and a [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=540.0200000000001s)]
*  Holocaust denier like Nick Fuentes be praising her? I think people should be very careful about [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=544.82s)]
*  that line of reasoning. After all, Nick Fuentes is also somebody who supports and has expressed [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=551.62s)]
*  support for in the past Donald Trump, so if you believe in this line of reasoning of guilt by [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=555.94s)]
*  association, Nick Fuentes is an anti-Semite and a Holocaust denier and a neo-Nazi. Nick Fuentes [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=560.98s)]
*  supports Donald Trump, therefore everybody who supports Donald Trump is also guilty of being [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=569.54s)]
*  an anti-Semite and Holocaust denier because they're in agreement with Nick Fuentes. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  Or for example, you could take that and extend it to other issues such as Bill Kristol and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=581.14s)]
*  Liz Cheney are vocal defenders of Israel and of US support and financing for Israel, therefore [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=588.9s)]
*  if you're a supporter of Israel and if you are somebody who believes the US should finance [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=598.74s)]
*  Israel then that means that you are a neocon, guilty of all the crimes for which neocons have [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=604.34s)]
*  been guilty of. After all, Bill Kristol and David Frum and Liz Cheney and people like that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=608.98s)]
*  agree with your view. This is the stuff of which smear campaigns are made. Now, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=613.6999999999999s)]
*  one of the claims that was used to try and really put the nail into Candace Owens coffin this week [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=619.6199999999999s)]
*  was the fact that she had liked a tweet, not retweeted it, not commented favorably upon it, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=626.02s)]
*  not repeated it, not cited it, but simply clicked the heart icon underneath it, which was defending [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=632.66s)]
*  her against accusations that she was an anti-Semite and it said in there something along the lines of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=639.62s)]
*  his Rabbi Shmueli continuing to drink the blood of Christians and some very pro-Israel, I don't want [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=644.42s)]
*  to call them a journalist because what kind of people stood online devoted to trolling the social [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=653.3s)]
*  media accounts of people who are critics of Israel to check their likes and then try and link them to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=660.02s)]
*  that but discovered that she had liked a tweet and she gave a long explanation which you should [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=665.46s)]
*  look at if you're interested on YouTube that she was basically just liking tweets that were [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=670.98s)]
*  defending her without really reading every word and the fact that you like a tweet does not mean [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=674.34s)]
*  you agree with all the sentiments expressed in it. If Candace Owens is somebody who believes that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=680.02s)]
*  Jewish people drink the blood of Christians, you should be able to point to her actually saying that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=684.4200000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of things you can say about Candace Owens. One of the things you cannot say is that she [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=688.98s)]
*  is actually shy or timid about expressing the views that she actually believes so the fact that [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=693.7s)]
*  to resort to she liked this tweet and this tweet that she liked had things that were in it that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=697.7s)]
*  were anti-Semitic shows you just how desperate the campaign became to destroy her reputation [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=703.46s)]
*  and that's because she is an actually prominent person with a lot of influence of the American [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=709.7s)]
*  right like Dr. Carlson who has been encouraging people to question why it is that the United [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=713.86s)]
*  States is paying for Israel's wars even though millions of Israelis have a higher standard of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=720.82s)]
*  living than millions of Americans and it's just something that is unsustainable for people who [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=724.98s)]
*  are fanatically devoted to Israel like Ben Shapiro and so many people on the American [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=732.98s)]
*  right for years that has been the third rail of establishment discourse. The price of admission [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=736.5s)]
*  to mainstream acceptability is that you support Israel and support U.S. financing of it not just [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=744.66s)]
*  in the Republican party or in the conservative movement but also in the Democratic party as well [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=751.38s)]
*  and the irony of course of all of this is that the people who got rid of Candace Owens [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=756.9s)]
*  and who were applauding that have spent years with their primary grievance being that the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=761.9399999999999s)]
*  American left and American liberals use exactly these tactics against those with whom they [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=766.74s)]
*  disagree. They called them racists. They get them fired from their jobs. They de-platform them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=772.5s)]
*  These were all the things we constantly hear from people like Barry Weiss and Ben Shapiro and Dave [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=778.5s)]
*  Rubin who all of whom got very rich, very very rich, a multi-multi-millionaire rich, branding [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=784.82s)]
*  themselves as people who more than anything believe in the right to have vigorous vibrant [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=793.78s)]
*  debates without being threatened with your livelihood. Only the left does that, the repressive [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=798.74s)]
*  authoritarian left and yet all of those people I've just mentioned we've documented it many times [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKHMLuA0II&t=802.98s)]
