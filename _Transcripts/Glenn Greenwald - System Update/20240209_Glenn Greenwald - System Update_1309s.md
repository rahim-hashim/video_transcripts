# Bloodbath: SCOTUS Grills CO Lawyer at Trump Ballot Hearing
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA)
*  One of the most underappreciated dynamics of American political life is that the people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=0.0s)]
*  who incessantly claim that they are here to save democracy, that they're the only political [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=12.08s)]
*  faction that cares about democracy, that needs to protect democratic values from the fascist [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=17.7s)]
*  and dictatorial onslaught of Donald Trump and his movement, are people who spend most [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=23.2s)]
*  of their time either getting their adversaries and critics censored from the internet or [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=27.36s)]
*  banned from the internet, trying to remove their political opponents from the ballot [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=33.54s)]
*  so that nobody can vote for them, and in the case of Donald Trump, trying to imprison their [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=38.42s)]
*  primary political rival. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=43.8s)]
*  It's bizarre that the people who are doing those things, those classically authoritarian [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=45.56s)]
*  moves, are people who simultaneously believe and insist that they are the only guardians [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=49.28s)]
*  of democracy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  One of the most remarkable events occurred last December, and we covered this at length [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=55.64s)]
*  when it happened, when the Colorado Supreme Court by a vote of 4 to 3 decided that Donald [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=60.96s)]
*  Trump ought to be banned from the Colorado ballot, both for the primary and then for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=66.56s)]
*  the general election on the grounds that he committed a crime that he's never been charged [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=71.24s)]
*  with, let alone convicted of, which was insurrection. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=75.0s)]
*  That ruling went to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=79.72s)]
*  Today the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=82.2s)]
*  We listened to it, and by all accounts, not just mine, including liberal outlets, the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  Supreme Court was overwhelmingly hostile, scornful toward the argument that Colorado [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  has the right to ban Trump or that any other state does on this ground. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=97.0s)]
*  Here from CNN, today Supreme Court hears a historic case on removing Trump from the ballot. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  Quote, the justices' questions suggested they may support putting Trump back on the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  ballot as they expect skepticism of Colorado's arguments. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=112.4s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote to watch, said the arguments are, quote, at war [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=116.28s)]
*  with the thrust of the 14th Amendment. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=120.6s)]
*  Liberal Justice Elena Kagan questioned the implications of a single state banning a candidate [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=124.0s)]
*  in a presidential election. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=129.2s)]
*  Now, this is the remarkable part of the ruling, is that two of the liberal judges, Justice [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=130.68s)]
*  Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, were, I would say, at least as hostile to Colorado's arguments [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=136.84s)]
*  as the conservative justices were, although they were quite hostile as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=144.4s)]
*  Maybe, maybe Justice Brown will be willing to rule in favor of Colorado, but I seriously [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=149.4s)]
*  doubt it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  But it seems likely that Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor will join the six other [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=159.32s)]
*  justices who are generally referred to as being conservative to deliver at least eight [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=165.84s)]
*  votes and then maybe nine unanimously against the Colorado ruling, which would be quite [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  a momentous event for the Supreme Court with that kind of a voice to say that the Democratic [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=176.0s)]
*  Party and the liberal effort, and that's what this was, even though it was brought in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=182.12s)]
*  name of several Republican individual voters, it was spearheaded and organized by CREW, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  which is a liberal activist group that claims to act in the name of epics in government, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=193.36s)]
*  even though they are obviously a Democratic Party activist group. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  It would be extraordinary if they get slapped out, not by six justices of the Supreme Court, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=202.84s)]
*  but by eight or even nine. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=207.56s)]
*  Here's an example of Justice Kagan questioning Jason Murray, who is the attorney for these [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=210.0s)]
*  Republican voters that they got to become the plaintiffs in the case, and you'll listen [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=217.0s)]
*  to just how clear her view was. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  Most boldly, I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=225.4s)]
*  should decide who gets to be president of the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=230.32s)]
*  In other words, this question of whether a former president is disqualified for insurrection [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=233.56s)]
*  to be president again is, just say it, it sounds awfully national to me. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=239.76s)]
*  So whatever means there are to enforce it would suggest that they have to be federal, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  national means. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=251.88s)]
*  Why does, you know, if you weren't from Colorado and you were from Wisconsin or you were from [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=252.6s)]
*  Michigan, and it really, you know, what the Michigan Secretary of State did is going to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=258.08s)]
*  make the difference between, you know, whether candidate A is elected or candidate B is elected, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=263.52s)]
*  I mean, it seems quite extraordinary, doesn't it? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=269.48s)]
*  No, Your Honor, because ultimately it's this court that's going to decide that question [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=272.32s)]
*  of federal constitutional eligibility and settle the issue for the nation, and certainly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=276.28s)]
*  it's not unusual that questions of national importance come up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=281.32s)]
*  Well, I suppose this court would be saying something along the lines of that a state [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  has the power to do it, but I guess I was asking you to go a little bit further and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=288.92s)]
*  saying why should that be the right rule? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=293.6s)]
*  Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=296.0s)]
*  own citizens but for the rest of the nation? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=301.96s)]
*  Because Article 2 gives them the power to appoint their own electors as they see fit, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=305.44s)]
*  but if they're going to use a federal constitutional qualification as a ballot access determinant, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=310.6s)]
*  then it's creating a federal constitutional question that then this court decides and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=316.72s)]
*  other courts, other states, if this court affirms the decision below, determining that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=321.36s)]
*  President Trump is ineligible to be president, other states would still have to determine [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=325.88s)]
*  what effect that would have on their own state's law and state procedure in terms of ballot [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  access. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=335.36s)]
*  If we're going to say, well, we're going to keep him on the ballot anyway, but really [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=337.2s)]
*  it's going to have, as Justice Kagan said, the effect of Colorado deciding, and it's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=344.64s)]
*  true, I just want to push back a little bit on, well, it's a national thing because this [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=349.6s)]
*  court will decide it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=353.0s)]
*  You say that we have to review Colorado's factual record with clear error as the standard [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=354.68s)]
*  of review. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=359.64s)]
*  So, we would be stuck, the first mover state here in Colorado. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=360.64s)]
*  We're stuck with that record. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=365.28s)]
*  And I don't want to get into whether the record, I mean, maybe the record is great, but what [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=367.4s)]
*  if the record wasn't? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, what if it wasn't a fulsome record? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  What if the hearsay rules are one-offs? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  Or what if this is just made by the secretary of state without much process at all? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=380.76s)]
*  All right, so you get the flavor there. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  That is an argument essentially saying that what Colorado did has the real possibility [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=388.0s)]
*  of preventing the person that the country actually wants to elect from getting enough [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=395.56s)]
*  votes simply by making a ruling about the 14th Amendment that has obvious federal consequences [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=400.96s)]
*  that is not the state of Colorado's to make. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=407.4s)]
*  And while the lawyer for Colorado is saying, well, no, you should make it, the Supreme [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=410.44s)]
*  Court is saying, but you're not actually asking us to make it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=414.34s)]
*  We can't make a ruling starting from scratch because we're bound by the factual record [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=416.76s)]
*  of what Colorado did if you were to win. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=421.44s)]
*  And what if Colorado has a bunch of weird rules about evidence and hearsay, and now [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=424.68s)]
*  we're stuck with this weird ballot that somehow is supposed to govern the entire country [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  and the right to choose a candidate? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=432.64s)]
*  That was always one of the weirdest parts of what Colorado did is it's so obvious that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  this is a federal election, that it belongs on a federal level with Congress or the federal [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=439.24s)]
*  courts and the judges, not just Amy Coney Barrett, but Olenna Kagan seem very emphatic [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=444.16s)]
*  about that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=451.0s)]
*  I mean, this goes on for another two, two and a half minutes like that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=452.0s)]
*  And there is barely an argument raised in favor of Colorado throughout the entire hearing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=456.16s)]
*  today. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=463.64s)]
*  And usually that's why as a lawyer, you go into an oral argument, you come out, you kind [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=464.64s)]
*  of try and read the tea leaves. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=468.72s)]
*  But a lot of times you think you win, you won, and then you end up losing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=470.56s)]
*  Or a lot of times you walk out saying, yeah, I think they're going to roll against me and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=474.16s)]
*  they win. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=476.56s)]
*  In this case, it wasn't hard to see. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=477.56s)]
*  They weren't pushing both sides. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=480.96s)]
*  They were only pushing one and they were pushing them hard. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=482.92s)]
*  And that was the state of Colorado. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=485.9s)]
*  Here is Justice Gorsuch, who had a lot of contempt for... [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=487.56s)]
*  Actually this is Justice Roberts first. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=497.28s)]
*  We're going to show you him, given that he's generally considered to be a swing vote. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=498.56s)]
*  And let's listen to what he had to say. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=503.88s)]
*  What do you do with what would seem to me to be plain consequences of your position? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=506.32s)]
*  If Colorado's position is upheld, surely there will be disqualification proceedings on the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=513.2s)]
*  other side and some of those will succeed. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=519.92s)]
*  Some of them will have different standards of proof. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=523.84s)]
*  Some of them will have different rules about evidence. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=526.24s)]
*  Maybe the Senate report won't be accepted in others because it's hearsay. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=530.9000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's beyond a reasonable doubt, whatever. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=535.08s)]
*  In very quick order, I would expect, although my predictions have never been correct, I [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=537.48s)]
*  would expect that a goodly number of states will say, whoever the Democratic candidate [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=543.6400000000001s)]
*  is, you're off the ballot, and others, for the Republican candidate, you're off the ballot, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=550.08s)]
*  and it'll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=555.64s)]
*  election. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=559.44s)]
*  That's a pretty daunting consequence. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=560.44s)]
*  Well, certainly, Your Honor, the fact that there are potential frivolous applications [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=563.12s)]
*  of a constitutional provision isn't a reason... [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=567.48s)]
*  Well, no, hold on. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=570.16s)]
*  I mean, you might think they're frivolous, but the people who are bringing them may not [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=571.16s)]
*  think they're frivolous. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  Insurrection is a broad term, and if there's some debate about it, I suppose that will [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=576.48s)]
*  go into the decision, and then eventually what we would be deciding, whether it was [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=581.32s)]
*  an insurrection when one president did something as opposed to when somebody else did something [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=586.6s)]
*  else, and what do we do? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=591.48s)]
*  Do we wait until near the time of counting the ballots and sort of go through which states [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=592.48s)]
*  are valid and which states aren't? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=599.0s)]
*  There's a reason Section 3 has been dormant for 150 years, and it's because we haven't [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=601.2800000000001s)]
*  seen anything like January 6th since Reconstruction. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=605.32s)]
*  Insurrection against the Constitution is something extraordinary. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=609.98s)]
*  It seems to me you're avoiding the question, which is other states may have different views [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=612.78s)]
*  about what constitutes insurrection, and now you're saying, well, it's all right because [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=616.74s)]
*  somebody, presumably us, are going to decide, well, they said they thought that was an insurrection, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=620.9s)]
*  but they were wrong, and maybe they thought... [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=625.3000000000001s)]
*  The lawyer actually is reminding me a lot of that YouTuber I debated about January 6th, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=627.66s)]
*  Destiny, who was... [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=632.7s)]
*  I think he thinks he's some kind of giant of journalism and also a constitutional scholar. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=633.78s)]
*  He was so definitive and certain that it's so obvious you just read the 14th Amendment. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=638.3399999999999s)]
*  He was saying it's so clear that Trump can't run. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=644.18s)]
*  He's guilty of an insurrection, and the entire Supreme Court is looking at this and saying, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=647.4599999999999s)]
*  this is insane, and just on the very first issue about whether Colorado even has the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=652.06s)]
*  right to decide this, let alone on all of the other issues about whether Colorado, if [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  they did have the right to decide, actually made this decision accurately to be able to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=662.18s)]
*  say, well, Trump wasn't charged with insurrection. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=667.8199999999999s)]
*  He wasn't convicted of insurrection. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=670.86s)]
*  He never had all the rights of a criminal trial that the Constitution guarantees when [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=672.74s)]
*  you're alleged to have committed a crime, and nonetheless, we're going to find, just [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=677.38s)]
*  kind of invent out of the air after a civil and evidentiary hearing, the last three days [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=683.3s)]
*  that the President of the United States is ineligible to run for office. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=688.5799999999999s)]
*  It is such an obviously anti-constitutional and anti-democratic posture, and it's very [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=693.1s)]
*  relieving to see the Supreme Court heaping this kind of scorn on it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=701.1s)]
*  And Justice Roberts is very soft spoken, but he was being pretty aggressive because he [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=705.62s)]
*  was not getting his answer, his question answered in lieu of these kind of streamer arguments [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=710.0600000000001s)]
*  like, well, it's so obvious this January 6th, never anything like it happened before, but [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=716.38s)]
*  if anyone else claims it's an insurrection, that would be frivolous. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=721.3399999999999s)]
*  That's like a high school debate argument that none of these justices are even letting [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=724.2199999999999s)]
*  this lawyer speak fairly because his arguments are not, they don't command any respect or [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=729.9799999999999s)]
*  any credence. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=736.54s)]
*  Here is probably the most hostile of the exchanges, and it was with Justice Gorsuch. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=739.02s)]
*  You rarely hear any judge treat a lawyer like this, let alone a lawyer that gets to the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court and is presumably qualified, and this lawyer actually clerked for, I believe, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=750.46s)]
*  a Supreme Court justice, but for sure an appellate court lawyer. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=759.1800000000001s)]
*  He's a well regarded lawyer in the legal world and yet actually clerked for Elena Kagan on [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=762.14s)]
*  the Supreme Court, and you saw how she treated him, so here's how Neil Gorsuch treated him. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=770.0600000000001s)]
*  I thought that was the whole theory of your case, and no proceduriness happens automatically. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=780.46s)]
*  I mean, so this is an important point, which is, the question is, how did Donald Trump [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=786.14s)]
*  become an insurrectionist? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=792.22s)]
*  When did this happen, and how, by what procedure? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=793.5s)]
*  Like I said, there was never any process that was given to lay out the case against him. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=796.7800000000001s)]
*  Jack Smith charged him with many crimes. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=805.74s)]
*  None of them was the crime of inciting or engaging in an insurrection, even though that is a crime [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=808.7800000000001s)]
*  in the US code. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=813.74s)]
*  He could have charged him with that, but didn't. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  One would think that if Jack Smith thought he could convict Trump on that charge, he would [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=817.1s)]
*  have charged him, and yet didn't. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=822.0600000000001s)]
*  And in that debate, I repeatedly asked why he wouldn't, and finally there was admission [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=825.98s)]
*  that, well, he probably doesn't think he can get a conviction. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=829.58s)]
*  Okay, well, that's a pretty significant concession. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=831.82s)]
*  And so the theory that Colorado invented and that its defenders concocted to try and justify [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=834.3s)]
*  what Colorado did is, oh, you don't need a procedure. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=839.8199999999999s)]
*  It's just automatic. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=841.9s)]
*  It's self-executing. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=843.74s)]
*  The minute someone commits an insurrection, they're banned from high office. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=844.78s)]
*  And they have to say that because Colorado has to admit there was never any procedure, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=850.78s)]
*  any finding that he committed an insurrection other than Colorado's own process. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=856.54s)]
*  There was no trial. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  There were no rights given. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=864.46s)]
*  And so Gorsuch is going to spend his time trying to understand how it could possibly [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=866.7s)]
*  be that Trump became ineligible for office instantly on January 6th, even though there [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=871.2600000000001s)]
*  was no process. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=877.74s)]
*  It just magically happened out of nowhere. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=878.46s)]
*  It was self-executing. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=880.1400000000001s)]
*  You say that there's no legislation necessary. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=881.2600000000001s)]
*  I thought that was the whole theory of your case and no procedure. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=886.3000000000001s)]
*  It happens automatically. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=889.98s)]
*  Well, certainly you need a procedure in order to have any remedy to enforce the disqualification. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=891.58s)]
*  That's a whole separate question. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=897.1800000000001s)]
*  That's the de facto doctrine. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=898.54s)]
*  Doesn't work here. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=899.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=900.7s)]
*  Put that aside. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=901.02s)]
*  He's disqualified from the moment. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=902.46s)]
*  Self-executing. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=905.98s)]
*  Done. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=907.1s)]
*  And I would think that a person who would receive a direction from that person, the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=907.98s)]
*  president, former president in your view, would be free to act as he or she wishes [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=913.98s)]
*  without regard to that individual. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=919.58s)]
*  I don't think so because I think again that- [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=921.58s)]
*  What he's essentially saying is if Trump became guilty of insurrection on the day that he [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=923.4200000000001s)]
*  did it, then it shouldn't even be the case that people inside the government would obey [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=928.14s)]
*  the orders of Trump, even though he was the inaugurated elected president, because it's [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=934.7s)]
*  just self-executing the minute a president does an insurrection. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=940.06s)]
*  You don't need a trial. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=943.66s)]
*  It just is like an inherent thing that just materializes in the air. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=944.6199999999999s)]
*  This is the Colorado lawyer's argument. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=948.06s)]
*  And Neil Gorsuch essentially saying, well, wouldn't that mean that everyone in government [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=951.0999999999999s)]
*  can just ignore anything Trump says or does because he's now no longer eligible to be [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=955.26s)]
*  president? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=959.18s)]
*  He's not even the president anymore by virtue of having committed an insurrection. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=959.42s)]
*  If that could really happen that way, that it's just self-executing. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=962.8599999999999s)]
*  It just materializes. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=965.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't think so because I think again the de facto officer doctrine would nevertheless [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=967.66s)]
*  come into play to say this is- [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=972.38s)]
*  No, de facto, that doesn't work, Mr. Murray, because de facto officer is to ratify the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=973.74s)]
*  conduct that's done afterwards and insulate it from judicial review. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=978.5400000000001s)]
*  Put that aside. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=983.1s)]
*  I'm not going to say it again. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=983.98s)]
*  Put it aside. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=985.02s)]
*  Okay? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=986.14s)]
*  I think Justice Lee is asking a very different question, a more pointed one, a more difficult [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=986.86s)]
*  one for you. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=990.78s)]
*  I understand, but I think it deserves an answer. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=991.26s)]
*  On your theory, would anything compel a lower official to obey an order from, in your view, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=994.46s)]
*  the former president? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1003.98s)]
*  I'm imagining a situation where, for example, a former president was, you know, a president [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1006.0600000000001s)]
*  was elected and they were 25 and they were ineligible to run office, but nevertheless [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1010.7s)]
*  they were put into that office. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1014.62s)]
*  No, no, no, we're talking about section three. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1015.2600000000001s)]
*  Please don't change the hypothetical, okay? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1016.86s)]
*  Please don't change the hypothetical. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1019.2600000000001s)]
*  I know I like doing it too, but please don't do it, okay? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1020.62s)]
*  The point I'm trying to make is that- [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1023.74s)]
*  He's disqualified from the moment he committed an insurrection. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1024.78s)]
*  Whoever it is, whichever party, that happens. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1028.14s)]
*  Boom. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1032.3s)]
*  It happened. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1033.42s)]
*  What would compel, and I'm not going to say it again, so just try and answer the question. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1034.78s)]
*  If you don't have an answer, fair enough, we'll move on. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1038.6200000000001s)]
*  What would compel a lower official to obey an order from that individual? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1041.1000000000001s)]
*  Because ultimately we have statutes and rules requiring chains of command. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1045.82s)]
*  The person is in the office and even if they don't have the authority to hold the office, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1050.86s)]
*  the only way to get someone out of the office of the presidency is impeachment. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1055.1s)]
*  And so I think if you interpreted section three in light of other provisions in the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1058.54s)]
*  constitution like impeachment, while they hold office, impeachment's the only way to [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1062.94s)]
*  validate that they don't have the ability to hold that office and should be removed. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1067.58s)]
*  I can't put into words how self-destructive that whole exchange is for Colorado's theory. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1072.3799999999999s)]
*  The whole point, as Neil Gorsuch started off saying and then got increasingly frustrated [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1077.58s)]
*  when he couldn't get an answer, was that the only way Colorado can justify what they did [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1082.3799999999999s)]
*  is if their view is we don't need a trial, we don't need a conviction, because the minute [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1088.78s)]
*  a person in the office of the presidency engages in an insurrection, they are from that point on [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1093.58s)]
*  ineligible to hold that office. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1101.4199999999998s)]
*  And so then the question became, well, why the minute January 6 happened would anybody in the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1103.42s)]
*  government have to obey Trump? After all, they would say, oh, he committed an insurrection. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1109.1000000000001s)]
*  He's now ineligible to be president. He can't hold the presidency. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1112.22s)]
*  And the lawyer's argument was, no, you have, you need a remedy. You need Congress to actually go [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1117.02s)]
*  do something. You would need Congress to impeach him based on the finding that he committed an [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1121.8200000000002s)]
*  insurrection. And that's the whole point of the Supreme Court about why we're not going to [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1125.74s)]
*  That's the whole point of the Supreme Court about why what Colorado did was so obviously baseless [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1131.1s)]
*  because there never was an act like that. Finding that Trump was guilty. There was no act like that [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1136.86s)]
*  from the Congress. Remember, they acquitted Trump on those charges, on the charges of impeachment. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1142.3799999999999s)]
*  There was never any court ruling, any criminal context charging him. Just Colorado just decreed [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1150.3s)]
*  it based on Colorado's little idiosyncratic state rules. And so the minute that lawyer said [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1157.1s)]
*  he wouldn't be automatically rendered powerless as president because he committed insurrection [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1165.6599999999999s)]
*  unless you had an act of Congress that removed him, the whole case is gone because you're then [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1171.4199999999998s)]
*  saying that it's not self-executing. You need an act of a legitimate body to determine and decree [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1176.54s)]
*  that he actually committed an insurrection. And that's exactly what Colorado does not have here. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1182.86s)]
*  It's such a, I mean, I just, I want to take note of how extraordinary it is [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1187.6599999999999s)]
*  that the strategy of the Democratic Party is to get Donald Trump removed from the ballot. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1196.1399999999999s)]
*  Banned from having people vote for him when they're looking at polls showing that the vast majority [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1203.02s)]
*  of Americans, of Republicans and a majority of Americans or at least a plurality who vote [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1208.54s)]
*  want to vote for Donald Trump instead of Joe Biden. And if Trump were convicted of a crime [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1213.9s)]
*  that the constitution says renders you ineligible, that would be one thing. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1219.8200000000002s)]
*  But to do that in the absence of any kind of a judicial ruling that says that other than what [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1224.22s)]
*  Colorado decides in its state court system it's going to do with no, none of the triggering of [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1228.7s)]
*  protections that a defendant gets when they're accused of a crime is mind-bogglingly anti-democratic [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1235.74s)]
*  with no basis in the constitution even though a lot of liberal YouTubers and tweeters and the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1243.18s)]
*  like will insist that it's such an obvious victory for Colorado that it's so obvious Trump can't [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1249.3400000000001s)]
*  one when when you finally get non-state judges, judges on the Supreme Court to take a look at [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1254.8600000000001s)]
*  this they reacted with horror with kind of shock and contempt. And I hope it is a unanimous ruling [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1262.7s)]
*  or eight to one which looks like it could be because I think that'll be an extremely [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1270.86s)]
*  justified comeuppance for this attempt. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDY8Q0FOAWA&t=1278.2199999999998s)]
