# Federal Court DISMISSES & Mocks UPenn Student Lawsuit
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4)
*  Now, the University of Pennsylvania student who stood up and said, I am not safe, let [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=0.0s)]
*  me repeat, I do not feel safe, even though he had never been attacked or threatened with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=11.44s)]
*  physical attack, and then now has become a sort of social media activist, always in defense [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  of Israel, pretty much a single issue American who constantly defends Israel, constantly [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=23.24s)]
*  attacks those who are critical of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=31.08s)]
*  It wasn't enough for him to just become a star victim at the U.S. Congress, for there [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  to be all sorts of measures enacted in the name of protecting him, even though he wasn't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=39.16s)]
*  endangered. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=43.76s)]
*  He didn't even though opportunistically sense the ability to profit personally from all [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=44.76s)]
*  of this newfound victimhood. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=52.8s)]
*  And one of the things he did was he initiated a lawsuit with a fellow Jewish student who [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=56.56s)]
*  was a supporter of Israel against the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=59.72s)]
*  Here from CNN, reporting on the lawsuit, December 8, 2023, two students claim that the University [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=64.08s)]
*  of Pennsylvania has violated the Civil Rights Act by not protecting Jewish students from [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=69.96s)]
*  anti-Semitism on campus. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  So he filed a lawsuit saying, it's not just that I feel unsafe, I am unsafe, and the fault [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=77.39999999999999s)]
*  of that is the university professors who didn't do enough to embrace me and hug me and hold [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=85.16s)]
*  me close to their chest and make me feel safe from all this anti-Semitism surrounding me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  One of the books that was most celebrated was written by the psychologist, Jonathan [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=99.88s)]
*  Hay, called Coddling of the American Mind, which I highly recommend, and it's a book [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=105.0s)]
*  about it, especially if you're a parent. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  It's a really good book to read about the tendency to overprotect children these days, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=111.88s)]
*  to keep them safe from every conceivable danger, and how doing so can deprive them of the ability [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  to develop the antibodies, both literal antibodies physically if you protect them too much from [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=123.32s)]
*  germs, but also metaphorical antibodies from things that make you uncomfortable in the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=129.88s)]
*  world. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=134.28s)]
*  Part of being an adult is to let kids feel uncomfortable, to have to have them navigate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=135.28s)]
*  through life, and we've created the situation where not only is parenting now about overprotection [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=139.28s)]
*  of children to the detriment of their ability to grow, but extended childhood, where now [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=145.08s)]
*  we expect that childhood to extend to colleges, where you don't send your kids away any longer [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=150.52s)]
*  to be adults, you send them away to be extended children, and it's the job of resident assistants [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=156.36s)]
*  or college deans or college presidents to keep them safe, to shield them the way an [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=161.76s)]
*  overprotective parent would. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=167.56s)]
*  And now how that has become made even more extreme through extended childhood into once [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=170.2s)]
*  you leave college or graduate school and you get a job, it's now the job of human resources [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=175.72s)]
*  and human resources managers to make sure you never feel uncomfortable, never feel unsafe, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=180.56s)]
*  never feel that pee beneath the 17th mattress on which you sleep, everyone's a little prince [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  and princess, any stray comment that you hear at work now gets reported to HR that then [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=192.08s)]
*  takes action to protect you, to make sure you feel safe. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=198.6s)]
*  That's what this book is about. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=201.76s)]
*  It became very popular among conservatives, but a lot of other people as well because [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=202.76s)]
*  it describes so presciently, so insightfully this dynamic, and yet all of that was instantly [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=206.32s)]
*  forgotten by things like two very privileged University of Pennsylvania students accusing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=213.44s)]
*  the administration of the University of Pennsylvania of not keeping them safe, not from physical [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=220.14s)]
*  assaults or threats of physical assaults, but from ideas that made them uncomfortable. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=225.4s)]
*  And the complaint was so over the top in terms of what it alleged about the University of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=232.04s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  Here was a little glimpse of the lawsuit filed by Eyal Yaakoby and Jordan Davis in the district [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  court for the district court of Eastern Pennsylvania in December. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=242.64s)]
*  There you see their names versus the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=247.64s)]
*  Here's part of what they allege. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=250.83999999999997s)]
*  Quote, Penn, the historic 300 year old Ivory League University has transformed itself into [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment, and discrimination. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  Once welcoming to Jewish students, Penn now subjects them to a pervasively hostile educational [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  environment. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=271.84s)]
*  Among other things, Penn enforces its own rules of conduct selectively to avoid protecting [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=273.23999999999995s)]
*  Jewish students from hatred and harassment, hires rabidly anti-Semitic professors who [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=277.52s)]
*  call for anti-Jewish violence and spread terrorist propaganda, and ignores Jewish students' pleas [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=283.34s)]
*  for protection. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  In doing so, Penn has placed plaintiffs and other Jewish and Israeli students at severe [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=293.0s)]
*  emotional and physical risk. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=297.52s)]
*  And then it lays out several laws and other causes of action that it claims the University [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=299.96s)]
*  of Pennsylvania is guilty of. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=305.08s)]
*  And here are just a few of the examples that they provide to substantiate these allegations [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=309.8s)]
*  such as, quote, Penn proudly hosted an anti-Jewish hate fest, euphemistically dubbed the, quote, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian Writers Literature Festival that calls to mind the infamous August 2017 Unite [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  the Right Hate Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=327.8s)]
*  So one of the things Penn did to put them in danger was they allowed Palestinian writers [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  to come and have a literary event at the University of Pennsylvania, probably including some criticism [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  of Israel that they felt threatened by. That was one of their examples. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=341.0s)]
*  Another was Penn hires rabidly anti-Semitic professors who call for anti-Jewish violence [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=345.1s)]
*  and spread terrorist propaganda, meaning that these professors criticize Israel, depict [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel in a way that they consider to be terrorist propaganda, and that Penn just didn't do enough [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=359.08s)]
*  to protect these students from all of these dangers that they faced. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=365.48s)]
*  Now students at Harvard also sued based on very similar grounds, claiming that Harvard [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  became the breeding ground for anti-Semitic violence, and in January of this year, the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=377.64s)]
*  day after Trump was inaugurated and Harvard became the subject of a lot of threats, Harvard [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  settled its lawsuit with the students accusing it of permitting anti-Semitism on campus by [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=386.8s)]
*  making all sorts of concessions to these pro-Israel students at Harvard, including all kinds of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=392.64s)]
*  measures designed to modify the curriculum. That was the lawsuit brought by Shavas Kassenbaum. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=399.08s)]
*  But the University of Pennsylvania did not actually settle the lawsuit brought by the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=407.08s)]
*  I am not safe, I do not feel safe, let me repeat, I do not feel safe student. They contested [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=412.08s)]
*  it, and just last week, here's the Daily Pennsylvanian, the student newspaper of the University of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=419.08s)]
*  Pennsylvania reporting the following, quote, federal judge dismisses the lawsuit alleging [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=425.08s)]
*  insufficient university response to anti-Semitism. The lawsuit originally filed by 2024 college [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=429.08s)]
*  graduate Eyal Yakobi and college junior Jordan Davis on December 24th was dismissed after [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=436.08s)]
*  federal judge Mitchell Goldberg found there were, quote, no allegations that the university [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=442.08s)]
*  had taken any actions which could, quote, be interpreted as anti-Semitic with the intention [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=447.08s)]
*  of causing harm to plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, which grew to include Wharton Engineering [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=452.08s)]
*  senior Noah Rubin and the group Student Against Anti-Semitism, alleged that Penn subjected [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=458.08s)]
*  them to a pervasively hostile educational environment and sued under Title VI of the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=464.08s)]
*  Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=469.08s)]
*  origin. Now, this lawsuit went to a federal judge who is not only Jewish, Judge Mitchell [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=475.08s)]
*  Goldberg, but is also a conservative judge appointed by George W. Bush and has long been [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=485.08s)]
*  regarded as a right-wing conservative judge. I'm sure these students who were suing the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=492.08s)]
*  University of Pennsylvania and their lawyers were very happy with the fact that it got [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=498.08s)]
*  assigned to this judge. If I were their lawyers, I would certainly consider this the ideal [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=502.08s)]
*  judge, a Jewish conservative judge appointed by George H.W. Bush. And yet, the decision [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=506.08s)]
*  that this judge issued that threw this case out by concluding that it doesn't even deserve [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=514.08s)]
*  discovery, it doesn't even deserve depositions or the gathering of evidence, just even if [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=522.08s)]
*  you believe everything that's in the complaint, the judge said, it doesn't even come close [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=528.08s)]
*  to alleging that the university failed in its duty to keep them safe, that it was a [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=534.08s)]
*  laboratory for anti-Semitic hatred, and the judge made very clear his disgust for this [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=538.08s)]
*  lawsuit, for the allegations in it, and for the tactics used by the lawyers in order to [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=544.08s)]
*  try and demonstrate that any of this was true. Here's the decision. We'll just read you a [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=550.08s)]
*  part of it. It was issued on June 2, 2005. It was against the trustees of the University [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=556.08s)]
*  of Pennsylvania. It was a 100-page amended complaint. Here's what the court said, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=561.08s)]
*  The plaintiff's 111-page amended complaint sets out a variety, a wide variety of general [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=566.08s)]
*  allegations, complaints, historical and current events, and alleged anti-Semitic incidents [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=572.08s)]
*  that allegedly took place not just on Penn's campus, but elsewhere in the United States [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=577.08s)]
*  and the world. The amended complaint also includes sweeping allegations of ideological, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=581.08s)]
*  philosophical, religious, and political concerns and grievances that have nothing to do with [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=586.08s)]
*  the federal lawsuit. It is unclear why plaintiffs' counsel deemed it necessary to allege so [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=591.08s)]
*  many unrelated facts when doing so is directly contrary to federal pleading requirements. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=596.08s)]
*  The University of Pennsylvania has filed a motion to dismiss and to strike the amended [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=603.08s)]
*  complaint. After review of the plaintiff's amended complaint, I find that it fails to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=606.08s)]
*  sufficiently allege the facts necessary to plausibly state viable claims under Title [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=611.08s)]
*  6, variety of the other laws that the plaintiff cited. Consequently, I will grant Penn's motion [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=617.08s)]
*  to dismiss. In order to state a claim for relief under Title 6, a plaintiff must plead [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=626.08s)]
*  facts that would support an inference of discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=631.08s)]
*  origin, and must allege he was treated differently from similarly situated persons who are not [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=636.08s)]
*  members of a protected class. Annexed to plaintiff's response, an opposition to Penn's motion [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=641.08s)]
*  to dismiss are declarations from plaintiffs Jacobi and Davis attesting to incidents of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=646.08s)]
*  anti-Semitism which they experience personally and to the fact that anti-Semitic campus hostilities [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=652.08s)]
*  are ongoing. Turning to the allegations in the case before me, plaintiffs allege at paragraphs [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=659.08s)]
*  22 and 278 of the amended complaint that Penn is a private university which receives financial [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=665.08s)]
*  assistance and federal funding from the United States government and therefore is subjected [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=670.08s)]
*  to Title 6, plaintiffs claim that through its quote, acts and omission, Penn and its [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=674.08s)]
*  administrators intentionally discriminated and harassed them on the basis of their actual [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=679.08s)]
*  and or perceived Jewish and or Israeli ancestry, race, ethnic characteristics, or national [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=684.08s)]
*  origin and forced them to endure a hostile environment. And then this is what the court [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=689.08s)]
*  says about those allegations. While plaintiffs spend an inordinate amount of space expounding [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=696.08s)]
*  on long past injustices and incidents, some of which dating as far back as 1993, and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=702.08s)]
*  complaining that Penn did not take the actions or respond to their reports, letters, or emails [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=710.08s)]
*  in the manner which plaintiffs wanted, plaintiffs have failed to plead any facts showing either [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=715.08s)]
*  deliberate intentional discrimination or deliberate indifference on the part of the university. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=721.08s)]
*  Indeed, I could find no allegations that Penn or its administration has itself taken [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=726.08s)]
*  actions or position which, even when read in the most favorable light, could be interpreted [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=732.08s)]
*  as anti-Semitic with the intention of causing harm to the plaintiffs. And here's the key. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=738.08s)]
*  At worst, plaintiffs accuse Penn of tolerating and permitting the expression of viewpoints [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=746.08s)]
*  which differ from their own. So we're at the stage of a lawsuit. As I said, there's [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=753.08s)]
*  no depositions yet. There's no discovery of evidence that has been yet gathered. All that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=759.08s)]
*  has happened is the plaintiffs filed their complaint. And when the defendant, in this [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=765.08s)]
*  case University of Pennsylvania, asks the court to dismiss the complaint, the court [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=770.08s)]
*  is required to assume that everything in the complaint is true. Just assume that everything [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=775.08s)]
*  that plaintiffs claim happened in the complaint is true. No evidence has to be presented. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=780.08s)]
*  It doesn't mean that the court is saying it happened. The court is just saying, let me [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=785.08s)]
*  assume that everything alleged here is true. And the court is saying, even if I assume [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=789.08s)]
*  that everything they allege is true, that it happened exactly as they claim, it still [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=794.08s)]
*  doesn't even get close to proving that the university permitted anti-Semitism to thrive, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=799.08s)]
*  that they subjected these students, including the one who went to Congress, stood by Mike [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=808.08s)]
*  Johnson, and said, I do not feel safe, nothing even close to proving that they were in any [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=812.08s)]
*  way endangered. At most, it says, the worst thing that you can say that the university [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=817.08s)]
*  did, and this is why I think it's so worth delving into this lawsuit, because it says [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=822.08s)]
*  so much about this entire narrative, is that, and again, this is the worst thing that could [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=827.08s)]
*  happen, that you could say that Penn did, that at worst, plaintiffs accused Penn of [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=835.08s)]
*  tolerating and permitting the expression of viewpoints which differ from their own. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=845.08s)]
*  This the entire time has been at the heart of this attempt to concoct this false narrative, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=853.08s)]
*  this false epidemic of anti-Semitism in the United States in general, on college campuses [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=859.08s)]
*  and in the United States, and I'm not saying there aren't a Jewish student here or one [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=864.08s)]
*  here who has been menaced or harassed, that's true of every member of every group, every [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=868.08s)]
*  day, in every college, every place. But overwhelmingly, this entire narrative has been based on [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=874.08s)]
*  the fact that not Jewish students, but pro-Israel students at colleges have to go to their college [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=882.08s)]
*  and they're not comfortable criticizing and complaining about and engaging in activism [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=890.08s)]
*  against a country that they love. And when they hear that foreign country that they love [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=895.08s)]
*  being criticized harshly, inside of them they feel uncomfortable, they feel unsafe. And [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=901.08s)]
*  a lot of students, not just Jewish students, who feel uncomfortable with ideas that they [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=911.08s)]
*  have heard in colleges, especially if you're 18, 19, 20, just going to college for the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=917.08s)]
*  first time, start saying, this seems like it's an attack on me. And we have re-checked [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=921.08s)]
*  consensus in society, at least we had, that that kind of discomfort is part of life, that [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=926.08s)]
*  you're not entitled to have authorities protect you from feeling uncomfortable because you're [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=931.08s)]
*  exposed to ideas that you dislike. That's part of the experience of going to college [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=936.08s)]
*  and becoming an adult. And yet in this case, when it came to this one group of people, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=940.08s)]
*  the American Jews and Jewish students, suddenly all of that was thrown out the window and [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=945.08s)]
*  it all got treated as some kind of epidemic of violence that required basically a rewriting [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=950.08s)]
*  of our civil liberties in order to avoid. And finally you have this court, a Jewish [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=955.08s)]
*  conservative judge, not just throwing this lawsuit out, which is throwing out the entire [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=961.08s)]
*  narrative that we've been subjected to, but mocking it as nothing more than a complaint [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=967.08s)]
*  from the Jewish and Jewish students that Penn permitted the expression of viewpoints [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=972.08s)]
*  that these college students disagree with. And that, said the court, was the entire basis [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=978.08s)]
*  of the lawsuit. And then the court goes on. The amended complaint acknowledges that Penn [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=984.08s)]
*  has responded to the anti-Semitic incidents and expression of anti-Semitism on its campus [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=989.08s)]
*  and has made efforts to address these problems. Many of the more than 300 paragraphs in the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=994.08s)]
*  amended complaint contain language which is unnecessarily inflammatory and impertinent [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=999.08s)]
*  and immaterial allegations that have virtually nothing to do with the claims which plaintiffs [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1005.08s)]
*  are endeavoring to raise. Filing of yet another amended complaint would be plaintiffs' [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1010.08s)]
*  third bite at the apple. Plaintiffs are cautioned that if they choose to file a third [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1016.08s)]
*  complaint, the additional allegations must be alleged in good faith and in compliance [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1022.08s)]
*  with rules 8A and 11. Rule 11 is basically what a court does is if you file a lawsuit [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1027.08s)]
*  or other process and have no good faith basis for doing so, if you are really doing it in bad [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1033.08s)]
*  faith, the court can sanction you. It can sanction you and your attorneys. It can impose monetary [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1039.08s)]
*  fines on you or other types of punishment. This is basically the court saying, look, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1045.08s)]
*  there's nothing here. The University of Pennsylvania did nothing wrong. You're just [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1051.08s)]
*  patchy entitled children upset that you had to hear views about Israel that you disagree [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1057.08s)]
*  with. And if you really want to try and for a third time rewrite this complaint and submit [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1063.08s)]
*  it and say, oh, this time we have incidents that justify our lawsuit, be cautioned that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1069.08s)]
*  unless you really have something this time and so far you're not even close, I will not only [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1076.08s)]
*  throw this lawsuit out again, but I will impose punishments on you, fines on you and your [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1082.08s)]
*  lawyers for abusing the time and the energy of the court and filing lawsuits in bad faith. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1088.08s)]
*  That's a pretty extreme threat for a judge, especially in a case like this to make. And yet [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1097.08s)]
*  finally there has been an institutional recognition of what has been going on for so long [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1103.08s)]
*  over the last almost two years since October 7th in the United States, where one particular [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1108.08s)]
*  minority group that wields a lot of power in Congress and in other sectors of American [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1114.08s)]
*  power were able to claim for themselves an entitlement that no other minority group has [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1120.08s)]
*  succeeded in claiming, which is the right not to have to hear or be exposed to criticism of [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1126.08s)]
*  foreign country that they love. And here's finally a court saying, your complaint, your grievance [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1133.08s)]
*  is not that you have been made unsafe. It is not that the administration permitted anti-Semitic [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1140.08s)]
*  threats or violence against you. Your complaint is nothing more than the childish view that you [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1146.08s)]
*  have the right to be protected from views that you dislike, that you think the administration [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1152.08s)]
*  should have silenced and censored those views. And because instead these views were allowed to be [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1156.08s)]
*  expressed by other students, you're so upset about it that you have filed a frivolous lawsuit in [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1160.08s)]
*  court that if you continue to pursue, you're going to end up not just having your case thrown out [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1167.08s)]
*  again and scorn heap on your claims again, but you will actually be punished this time. This is [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1173.08s)]
*  not aberrational. This has been what this entire movement has been about. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4UVxbxRug4&t=1181.08s)]
