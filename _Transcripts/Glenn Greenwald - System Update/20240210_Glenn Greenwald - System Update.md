# Mark Cuban Melts Down Over Mean “X” Comments
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA)
*  So imagine if you're a billionaire, obviously everybody around you constantly is just yesing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=0.0s)]
*  you to death because they live off of and depend upon your largesse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=12.72s)]
*  When you're a billionaire, you're funding probably hundreds if not thousands of people's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=17.16s)]
*  jobs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And one of those billionaires is Mark Koobman, who's the founder of AOL or the co-founder [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=24.16s)]
*  of AOL back in the 1990s. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=28.88s)]
*  That's where he made his first fortune and then he bought the Dallas Mavericks and he's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=29.88s)]
*  worth eight or ten billion dollars. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=33.92s)]
*  Turned himself into a celebrity and a public figure by owning the Dallas Mavericks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=36.32s)]
*  Did a by all accounts good job, brought them an NBA championship. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  But what happened was he stuck his head up on X in order to defend DEI, which are the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=44.92s)]
*  equality and inclusion programs that corporations have adopted and academia has adopted and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=52.919999999999995s)]
*  media has adopted. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=59.28s)]
*  Basically to say that we're only going to hire people who meet our racial and ethnic [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=61.44s)]
*  and gender quotas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=69.12s)]
*  So we're only going to hire more black people for these jobs or more Latino people or more [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=71.7s)]
*  women but not white men. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=75.96s)]
*  And obviously it's created a lot of anger among a lot of people, not just white people [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=77.96s)]
*  but a lot of people who find it offensive. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=81.96s)]
*  And Mark Koobman appeared on Twitter to respond to Elon Musk who was criticizing his programs [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  in order to defend them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  And when he defended them, he heard a lot of people, thousands of them vehemently denouncing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=90.6s)]
*  his ideas. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Which is exactly what you want billionaires to have to be exposed to given their extraordinary [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=99.16s)]
*  power, not just financial power but political power. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=103.36s)]
*  As a result, he went on a campaign where he suddenly began whining that Elon Musk and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=108.08s)]
*  X allow unique levels of hate speech unlike any other platform because they don't censor [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=112.84s)]
*  enough. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=119.08s)]
*  Here's what he said in an interview on February 6th, which was a couple days ago, about his [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=120.08s)]
*  experience on Twitter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=125.44s)]
*  Social media has changed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=128.28s)]
*  It's no longer social. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=129.28s)]
*  And since Twitter became X, I mean like I was telling you, Yasmin, like when I get Jew [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=131.68s)]
*  ban, I get you're not white, you're Jewish. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=139.76s)]
*  I get tell the Jew to shut the fuck up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=144.76s)]
*  And I just bookmark them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=147.84s)]
*  Twitter has become just a cesspool for hate. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=149.76s)]
*  And so trying to go there and change people's mind, I mean I've seen people try and then [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=152.82s)]
*  everybody just gangs up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=158.0s)]
*  And Instagram, just people avoid it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=161.0s)]
*  And then same with Lincoln, it's just not that platform. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=163.04s)]
*  Social media, I don't see as being that place. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=166.34s)]
*  I think you've got to go face to face. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=168.68s)]
*  That's why when I have these conversations, I go where I know people are going to disagree [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=174.4s)]
*  with me, whether it's DEI or whatever. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=178.76s)]
*  Imagine being worth $8 billion. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=183.32s)]
*  Just think about what $8 billion is for a second. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=186.96s)]
*  Sometimes I think that these numbers are so abstract, they are difficult to process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=188.8s)]
*  So imagine you have $10 million for most people, that's an extraordinary amount of money. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=194.56s)]
*  And then you multiply that by 10, so you have 10 of those $10 million. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=200.08s)]
*  You're only up to $100 million. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=205.24s)]
*  You have to multiply it by 10 again. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  You have $100 million, stacks of $100 million. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=212.12s)]
*  You have to multiply it by 10. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  You have 10 of those in front of you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  Only then do you get to a billion. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=218.0s)]
*  He has eight of those stacks. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=219.76s)]
*  $8 billion. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=222.28s)]
*  It's obviously more money than you can ever spend in your lifetime. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=225.8s)]
*  I remember when we founded The Intercept and the person who was funding it was the multi-billionaire [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=228.36s)]
*  who founded eBay, Pierre Omidyar, and he gave an interview and he announced, oh, over the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=237.08s)]
*  course of several years, I'm going to devote $250 million to this new media company. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=242.32s)]
*  Not only to The Intercept, but he wanted to create a media company and did that, had a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=247.84s)]
*  lot of other different components to it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=250.72s)]
*  And the media went wild. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=253.44s)]
*  Like oh my God, he's going to spend $250 million on this new media outlet, which was the same [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=255.08s)]
*  price Jeff Bezos had just paid for The Washington Post, $250 million. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=262.32s)]
*  And I remember early on talking to his chief financial officer when we were creating The [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  Intercept and he said to me, you know, it's so funny, the media reacted to Pierre Omidyar [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=271.36s)]
*  saying he's going to spend $250 million when for someone who's worth $8 billion, it's like [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=275.8s)]
*  pocket change. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=281.12s)]
*  Just by having $8 billion, you make a billion dollars every year from interest, from return [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  on investments, very safe investments. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=287.04s)]
*  Like $250 million, you don't even notice. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  But that's the scale of the kind of level of financial power that then turns into political [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=293.48s)]
*  power that people like Mark Cuban have. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=297.56s)]
*  Imagine amassing that level of wealth and that level of power and then going on an interview [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=301.52s)]
*  in front of cameras and whining about the fact that social media enables people to criticize [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=307.4s)]
*  you and sometimes criticize you in ways that you think are unfair or is too harsh. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=313.0s)]
*  And he singled out Axe because he has been gunning into conflicts with Elon Musk. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=319.92s)]
*  But this is a common accusation against Axe that by allowing free speech, there's a overflow [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=326.32s)]
*  of all sorts of hate speech and disinformation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=330.96s)]
*  I saw this and what happened here was incredibly obvious to me. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=334.64s)]
*  I had seen it many times. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  It was the dynamic I just explained. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  And I tweeted the following, quote, elites of all kind have been whining that social [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=343.38s)]
*  media platforms are, quote, full of hatred since social media existed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  That Axe is somehow uniquely fostering hate speech is solely because Musk refuses to censor [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  as much and because of Mark Cuban's anger that he's not universally adored here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=359.56s)]
*  And over my tweet, he posted the following. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=367.36s)]
*  He said, we disagree. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=370.56s)]
*  It's not about censorship. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=372.70000000000005s)]
*  I've never asked for censorship. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=373.70000000000005s)]
*  It's about hate speech crowding out people who don't want to be where hate is. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  And if I wanted to be adored, this is not the place to go. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=379.58000000000004s)]
*  LOL. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's but that's what he's saying. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  He's saying he's not going to use X anymore. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=385.44s)]
*  He prefers threads because threads or LinkedIn or I guess Instagram is a place where people [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=386.84s)]
*  disagree peacefully. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  Have you ever looked at a threads argument? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=397.96s)]
*  There have been media reports claiming that threads has hate speech on it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=401.96s)]
*  People block comments all the time in Instagram because they're mauled by all. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=406.55999999999995s)]
*  This is human nature. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=410.17999999999995s)]
*  This is not causing hate social media. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=412.76s)]
*  It's reflecting how people respond. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=415.16s)]
*  And in particular, they respond especially to powerful people and they don't treat them [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  deferentially. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=423.8s)]
*  And these powerful people interpret that as some kind of moral crime. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=424.8s)]
*  He then went on. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  And if I wanted to be adored, this is not the place to go. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  LOL. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=434.12s)]
*  Despite Elon Musk being a nonstop joyride of positivity to me? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=435.12s)]
*  Question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  And while so... [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=441.6s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=442.6s)]
*  Those are emojis. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a laughing emoji. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=446.44s)]
*  Like, he made a big joke. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=447.44s)]
*  Like, haha, Elon Musk is a joyride of positivity toward me. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=448.8s)]
*  And while social media as a whole may reflect the world, this platform certainly does not. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=452.12s)]
*  It's not only become an echo chamber. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=457.0s)]
*  In many cases, it's hard to know whether a post is originated by a bot. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=458.48s)]
*  I've been active here for a long time. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=462.44s)]
*  The nature of conversations in my replies and shown to me has changed considerably, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=464.0s)]
*  including many people who used to be active here rarely are no longer posting. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=468.16s)]
*  I think it's because the algorithm is designed to reward the largest account and those who, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=471.44s)]
*  particularly paying users, who engage with it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=475.36s)]
*  To some, that is a huge positive. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=478.32s)]
*  To me, the platform would have better served if Elon kept on posting but removed himself [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=479.8s)]
*  from the algo. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=483.64s)]
*  His posts influence what the entire site sees. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=485.24s)]
*  Removing them from the algorithm would democratize the site considerably. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=487.9s)]
*  Every entrepreneur makes their own decisions and time to tell if they are right or wrong. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=491.44s)]
*  So we will see. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=494.96s)]
*  Now, you heard what he said. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=495.96s)]
*  Did it have anything to do with that much more selfless and high-minded point about [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=498.2s)]
*  which would better serve, how well X does in the future? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=505.52s)]
*  No. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=509.8s)]
*  He was winding in here, complaining that so many people were cursing at him and hurling [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=510.8s)]
*  invective at him. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=514.4399999999999s)]
*  Now what is amazing about this is if you go and look at anybody who is even in the public [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=517.16s)]
*  eye a little bit, people have nothing to do with politics. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=522.76s)]
*  People who write about food or TV or sports or culture, they get just as attacked with [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=526.12s)]
*  invective. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=534.28s)]
*  In fact, I have never seen the kind of invective that tennis players get on Instagram or other [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=535.28s)]
*  athletes get on Instagram, largely from people who bet on them, like bettors who just bet [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=542.2s)]
*  all day on, bet their paycheck on competitive sports competitions and when they lose, they [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=547.88s)]
*  go to these tennis players' sites and they just heap immense amounts of scorn on them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=553.08s)]
*  Just the most hateful things you've ever seen. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=557.72s)]
*  I mean, vile spewing, like accusing them of being drug addicts and cheating and fixing [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=561.6s)]
*  and losing on purpose because they're paid to lose, just like intense rage. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=568.64s)]
*  And there's this new podcast called the Changeover Podcast which is by and about tennis players [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=574.2800000000001s)]
*  who are ranked 300 in the world or 500 in the world, 800 in the world, they basically [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=581.16s)]
*  make no money. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=586.2s)]
*  They find ways to get money to go around the world and play in tournaments but they don't [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=587.36s)]
*  ever climb up the rankings to make a lot of money. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=590.8s)]
*  They're poor, basically. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=592.64s)]
*  They're just grinding on the lower levels of the tennis tour and they get a lot of this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=593.64s)]
*  invective and hatred too. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=598.72s)]
*  And here was three of these tennis players or four of them all ranked in the very low [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=599.92s)]
*  end of the ranking, making no money, talking about the hate they get on Instagram when [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=604.32s)]
*  they lose and just listen to the difference in their attitude about the hatred they get [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=609.48s)]
*  compared to what Mark Cuban was whining about when he went on that interview. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=614.28s)]
*  Alright, we have a few Instagram questions. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=618.28s)]
*  So the first one is from Henry. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=621.6s)]
*  How do you handle the pressure and expectations from being a rising star? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=624.36s)]
*  Do you even feel like you have? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=627.64s)]
*  I don't know if I handle it or not. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=631.12s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=632.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=633.12s)]
*  I guess I don't take input from what other people think. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=635.64s)]
*  I think that it's an internal struggle to try and be as good as you can. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=639.6s)]
*  So when I think about my goals, I think there's like zero of it is predicated on how other [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=643.84s)]
*  people expect me to do or how other people want me to do. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=650.28s)]
*  I think it's all an internal drive. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=652.96s)]
*  So if I don't do well, then I'm kind of like, oh, it sucks. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=655.8000000000001s)]
*  I didn't do well but I must have done something not good enough. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=659.76s)]
*  Or if I do do well, then it's like, that's great that I did something well and I can [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  keep on going. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=667.0s)]
*  But I don't think that any of it is based on how other people think. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=668.0s)]
*  Even though there's a lot of Instagram haters out there. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=674.28s)]
*  I kind of like that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  Quite a lot today. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=678.9200000000001s)]
*  Evan's going crazy today. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=679.9200000000001s)]
*  No way. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  Got a lot today. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and the close matches sometimes, it's just brutal. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  I think they gave up on me. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=686.32s)]
*  I don't get that many anymore. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=687.32s)]
*  The best are the ones when they're like, they hate you and they start like, they start cussing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=689.32s)]
*  you out and then their friend like hops on like, yeah, like this guy blah blah blah. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=694.48s)]
*  And then you actually end up like winning. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=699.24s)]
*  You were up like five two and now it's like five six. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=701.24s)]
*  You suck. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  Quit tennis forever. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=706.0400000000001s)]
*  And then the guy's like, let's go. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  You won the set. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  One day later, you're sitting there like scrolling your phone like, wow, these people are insane. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  We had a funny one today. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=713.8000000000001s)]
*  I didn't tell you. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=715.4000000000001s)]
*  The funny one today was so on the Instagram page. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=716.8s)]
*  So we have a partnership with pro stringer. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=720.4599999999999s)]
*  So you know, Ruben Statham is who owns pro stringer, I guess. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=722.56s)]
*  So like a couple of weeks ago, I guess he lost a match and we have like on Instagram, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=726.38s)]
*  we have a collab with pro string on one of our posts. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=731.12s)]
*  So I see like, oh, Ruben Statham so trash, blah, blah, blah, blah, talking about Ruben [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=733.76s)]
*  Statham. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=737.7199999999999s)]
*  And I guess I wasn't paying attention. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=738.7199999999999s)]
*  Normally I delete them, but I just didn't delete this one. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=740.0s)]
*  And then today you played and they came to the same post and the same responses. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=742.4799999999999s)]
*  And also Evans was just trash. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=746.68s)]
*  So two people get to burn on the same post. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=749.9599999999999s)]
*  The double whammy on the post that's not even. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=752.56s)]
*  That's two birds, one stone. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=754.92s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=756.4s)]
*  And people that don't understand it, like some of like even like family friends sometimes. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=757.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=761.64s)]
*  So they're laughing about it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=762.64s)]
*  They're saying, ha ha, these people are insane. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=763.64s)]
*  They come and hurl the most disgusting and vective at us. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  And these are like poor tennis players who make no money. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=768.8399999999999s)]
*  And Mark Cuban is whining endlessly about the unfair treatment he gets on X. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=771.88s)]
*  And again, it's really because and I've seen this dynamic so many times before that people [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=779.76s)]
*  who are media elites or political elites or financial elites think that they're supposed [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=786.4s)]
*  to be treated by the public the way the people they surround themselves with treat them. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=790.4399999999999s)]
*  And when they find that they express opinions and they people get angry at them, they really [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=796.88s)]
*  think some kind of moral crime has been committed, that there's something wrong with social media, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=802.48s)]
*  that there's something wrong with journalism, with with the Internet. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=807.64s)]
*  And I told you I've seen journalists for so long before the Internet. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=813.32s)]
*  Think about what it was like to be a corporate journalist. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=817.38s)]
*  You worked the New York Times, you worked at ABC News. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=818.96s)]
*  You never heard any criticisms from the public for anything that you did. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=821.68s)]
*  The most you got was like a letter to the editor to the New York Times that would criticize [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=826.88s)]
*  an article and they would throw it into the garbage and laugh at it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=836.56s)]
*  And so it's easy to understand why people like this would end up hitting the Internet [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=840.2399999999999s)]
*  because for the first time they actually had to hear criticisms from the public. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  This is what's behind the drive to control the Internet, to censor social media. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  Are people like this who can't stand the fact that they have to hear criticism? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=857.0s)]
*  And for me that's the biggest benefit of Internet era journalism is that you do have to hear [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=860.94s)]
*  from people telling you that you're wrong, telling you that you're biased, telling you [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=865.7600000000001s)]
*  that you're terrible. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  And even if it sometimes goes onto the edge of excess or invective or hatefulness, it's [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=872.06s)]
*  nonetheless the case that overall it's much healthier to err on the side of having our [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=881.7399999999999s)]
*  most powerful elites hear more criticisms rather than less or none. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTpTOFbSlSA&t=886.38s)]
