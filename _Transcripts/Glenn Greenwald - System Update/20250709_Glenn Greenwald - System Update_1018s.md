# Trump's Ukraine 180: Continuing Biden's Policies?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY)
*  One of the other main issues that had united and defined and shaped the Trump movement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=0.0s)]
*  over the last four years was a very strong, close to unified and unanimous opposition [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=13.88s)]
*  among MAGA populists to the Biden administration's policy of arming and financing Ukraine in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=20.76s)]
*  this war against Russia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=30.800000000000004s)]
*  I had many MAGA influencers and pundit. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  I had members of Congress who are MAGA on my show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=36.96s)]
*  And one after the next, they all vehemently denounced US funding and arming of the war [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  in Ukraine, arguing it was futile. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=44.72s)]
*  It's not our war. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=46.96s)]
*  It's not our business. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=47.96s)]
*  We have to use our resources to take care of our own people at home. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=49.16s)]
*  That's what America first was. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  And President Trump was highly critical of that Biden policy, on top of which he repeatedly [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=55.04s)]
*  promised he would get a deal done, not, I'm going to try and get a deal done. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=62.44s)]
*  He said, I'll solve it in 24 hours, even if that was a little hyperbolic, as he now claims. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=66.16s)]
*  He's had four months, five months. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  He's not even close to getting it done. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=72.28s)]
*  And a lot of people were saying, when he kept saying, I'm going to get it done in 24 hours, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  they kept saying, Putin's not going to sign whatever deal you tell him to. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=78.44s)]
*  He's winning the war. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=82.24s)]
*  They've spent enormous amounts of money, lost tens of thousands, if not more, Russian lives [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=83.64s)]
*  in pursuit of a war that they believe is in their existential interest to win. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  They're going to just give up because you tell them to. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=97.44s)]
*  And he was like, no, no, they will. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=100.68s)]
*  Now, just at the beginning of this month, we were told that the Trump administration [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=104.2s)]
*  was going to pause sending munitions and other missiles to Ukraine because the US doesn't [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  have them to give. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=117.64s)]
*  We're low in our own stockpiles, in part because we've sent so much to Ukraine, we've sent [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=118.88s)]
*  so much to Israel, we use them to protect Israel from ballistic missiles sent by Iran. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=124.16s)]
*  We've used them to bomb Yemen for whatever reason for a full month. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=128.94s)]
*  We just don't have it to give, we were told. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=134.42s)]
*  And as a result, Politico July 1st, this is last week, US pauses some munitions shipments [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=136.32s)]
*  to Ukraine, including air defense missiles. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=141.64s)]
*  Senior White House official says, quote, The Pentagon has halted shipments of some air [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=143.74s)]
*  defense missiles and other precision munitions to Ukraine due to worries the US weapons stockpiles [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=147.74s)]
*  have fallen too low. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=152.78s)]
*  The decision was driven by the Pentagon's policy chief, Elbridge Colby, and was made [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=155.1s)]
*  after a review of Pentagon munitions stockpiles, leading to concerns that the total number [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=159.38s)]
*  of artillery rounds, air defense missiles, and precision missile munitions was shrinking. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=164.5s)]
*  According to three people familiar with the issue, White House Deputy Press Secretary [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=170.38s)]
*  Anna Kelly said in a statement, the decision was, quote, made to put America's interests [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=173.54s)]
*  first, following a DOD review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=178.26s)]
*  across the globe. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=183.22s)]
*  The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=184.46s)]
*  Just ask her on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=187.58s)]
*  Just ask her on if you have any doubts. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=190.22s)]
*  They do, she went on, they do want to have the anti-missile missiles, as they call them, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=191.94s)]
*  and we're going to see if we can make some available. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  Trump said at a news conference at the end of the NATO summit in The Hague on Wednesday, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=199.5s)]
*  quote, they are very hard to get. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=202.74s)]
*  So this is what we were told. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=206.26s)]
*  Remember, we did reporting on this as well right after Trump negotiated the ceasefire [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  between Iran and Israel, that basically Israel needed this war to end. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=214.62s)]
*  Israel's own air defense system was going down to zero. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  Iran's missiles were getting through at a much higher rate. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=221.94s)]
*  They were not even sending that many missiles, and yet there was all kinds of contact and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=223.94s)]
*  impact and destruction. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=228.14s)]
*  Trump himself said Israel was getting pounded, especially in the last several days, and the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=229.48s)]
*  US didn't have any to give them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=233.78s)]
*  They didn't have any to replenish. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  The US was running out of its own missiles to protect Israel, and so Israel needed an [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=236.22s)]
*  end to this war. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=239.78s)]
*  I know we all believe that it was a great triumph. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=240.78s)]
*  The United States and Israel kicked Iran's ass. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=243.38s)]
*  We pounded them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=246.7s)]
*  We won. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=247.74s)]
*  You know, that's always war propaganda. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=248.74s)]
*  I remember growing up, I was told the US never lost a war, never lost a war in its history, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=251.34s)]
*  and I was hearing this after the Vietnam War. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=257.38s)]
*  So this stockpile depletion is very real. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=262.94s)]
*  NBC News, July 4th, just four days ago, Pete Hegseth halted weapons for Ukraine despite [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=266.46s)]
*  a military analysis that the aid wouldn't jeopardize US readiness. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=272.38s)]
*  Quote, the Defense Department held up a shipment of US weapons for Ukraine this week over what [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=275.38s)]
*  officials said were concerns about its low stockpiles, but an analysis by senior military [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=280.34s)]
*  officers found that the aid package would not jeopardize the American military's own [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=285.42s)]
*  ammunition supplies, according to three US officials. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=288.86s)]
*  The move to halt the weapons shipment blindsided the State Department, members of Congress, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=292.1s)]
*  officials in Kiev, and European allies, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  matter. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=298.94s)]
*  Suspending the shipment of a military aid to Ukraine was a unilateral step by Defense [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=299.94s)]
*  Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to three congressional aides and a former US official [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=303.54s)]
*  familiar with the matter. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=307.82000000000005s)]
*  All anonymous sources just backbiting one another. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=308.82000000000005s)]
*  Elbridge Colby said, we did a review of our stockpile. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=312.42s)]
*  It's way too low to be able to risk sending more to Ukraine. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=317.06s)]
*  We don't have it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  Pete Hegseth made that same decision. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  The White House confirmed it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=321.78s)]
*  And then a bunch of anonymous cowards inside the Pentagon who obviously want the US to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  continue its bipartisan Biden-Trump policy of arming Ukraine ran to NBC and was like, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=327.78s)]
*  yeah, that's not true. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=334.78s)]
*  We can send them all the missiles at once. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't threaten our stockpile. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=337.53999999999996s)]
*  Everyone's anonymous in this article. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=339.38s)]
*  Quote, it was the third time Hegseth on his own has stopped shipments of aid to Ukraine, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=341.17999999999995s)]
*  the sources said. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=345.7s)]
*  Here is Trump at the White House yesterday. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=346.86s)]
*  Again with Netanyahu, as always, third time, five months that Netanyahu has visited the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=357.02s)]
*  US. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=363.5s)]
*  No other world leader has visited twice as Netanyahu's third trip. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=364.5s)]
*  And here is what Trump said when asked about Ukraine. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=368.38s)]
*  Are you planning to send more weapons to Ukraine? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=371.38s)]
*  We're going to send some more weapons. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=374.38s)]
*  We have to. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=376.98s)]
*  They have to be able to defend themselves. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=377.98s)]
*  They're getting hit very hard now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=379.62s)]
*  They're getting hit very hard. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=381.9s)]
*  We're going to have to send more weapons. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=382.9s)]
*  You have defensive weapons primarily, but they're getting hit very, very hard. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=384.26s)]
*  So many people are dying in that mess. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=390.9s)]
*  Now so ironically, revealing what Fox News is, let's go back to that, please. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=395.26s)]
*  The graphic, the onscreen graphic, the whole time Trump was speaking was Netanyahu nominates [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=401.26s)]
*  Trump for Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=409.34s)]
*  And it just stays up the whole time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=412.58s)]
*  So you have one leader, an Israeli leader, who has completely destroyed civilian life [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=415.7s)]
*  in Gaza, killing tens of thousands of children and other innocent people by huge amounts [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=422.02s)]
*  with the goal of ethnically cleansing Gaza as they're now being explicit. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  And you have another president, the one in the United States, who like his predecessor, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=433.74s)]
*  Joe Biden, has been paying for what the overwhelming consensus of human rights groups around the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=437.82s)]
*  world say is a genocide. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=444.3s)]
*  And Fox News has the audacity to say he's been nominated, Trump has, for a Nobel Peace [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=447.82s)]
*  Prize. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=452.1s)]
*  There's no such thing as a nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=453.1s)]
*  I believe it was a national review writer, I think it might have even been Joel Nagoldberg, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=459.54s)]
*  who used to put in his bio, nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize or something like that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=464.06s)]
*  Anyone can nominate anyone, it's completely meaningless, that's not a thing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=469.14s)]
*  It's not like being nominated for an Academy Award, where the Academy picks the five top [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=472.22s)]
*  actors but you don't win, so you're like, oh I was nominated. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=476.66s)]
*  That's not how this works. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=480.7s)]
*  But Netanyahu knows he can flatter Trump and get whatever he wants. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=482.58000000000004s)]
*  He comes with the letter saying Mr. President, I've nominated you for the Nobel Peace Prize [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=486.62s)]
*  and Trump is like, oh, it's so important. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=489.74s)]
*  And then Fox News acts like it's some huge accomplishment. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=491.9s)]
*  It's like state TV to an insane level. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=496.82s)]
*  But also the whole time that's on there, Trump is talking about arming Ukraine so they can [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=500.9s)]
*  continue this war. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=504.74s)]
*  And yeah, defensive weapons is what he's saying, although not only defensive weapons, but that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=506.66s)]
*  was the Biden administration policy as well. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=514.74s)]
*  Here's the next part of this, where Trump is again asked about Ukraine and this is what [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=518.1s)]
*  he says. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=523.58s)]
*  Mr. President, you have sent more weapons to Ukraine as you said last night. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=524.58s)]
*  Last week the Pentagon paused some shipments of weapons to Ukraine. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=528.58s)]
*  Did you approve of that pause? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=532.1400000000001s)]
*  We want to put defensive weapons because Putin is not treating human beings right, he's killing [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=533.1400000000001s)]
*  too many people. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=540.26s)]
*  So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine and I've approved that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=541.66s)]
*  So who ordered the pause last week? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=546.78s)]
*  I don't know, what did you tell me? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=548.58s)]
*  So Trump's basically saying, I didn't know anything about this pause, I didn't do it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=551.3s)]
*  I just want to pause for a second on the dark and sick irony that Donald Trump is accusing [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=556.14s)]
*  of killing too many civilians while he's sitting across the table from his extremely good friend [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=566.66s)]
*  and close ally whom he loves, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has killed infinitely more innocent people [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=571.38s)]
*  in Gaza with the US paying for it and the US arming it and the US protecting it under [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=578.26s)]
*  two consecutive presidents, one a Democrat, one a Republican. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=583.9s)]
*  And Putin isn't treating human life well. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=587.56s)]
*  And that's why Putin is this bad person who means that Trump has to now continue the Biden [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=592.78s)]
*  policy that he said for so long he opposed of arming Ukraine. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=599.1s)]
*  Did he just discover this? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=604.18s)]
*  That people in Ukraine are getting killed as a result of this war? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  Is that like a new thing he just found out in the last few days that made him do a 180 [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=609.62s)]
*  and now want to send weapons and arm the Ukrainians? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=615.1s)]
*  Here's more of Trump explaining this policy reversal. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=619.66s)]
*  I mean, again, this idea that, oh, Putin spouts a lot of bullshit in Trump's words, he's very [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=649.66s)]
*  nice to me, but it's meaningless, he can't be trusted. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=671.6999999999999s)]
*  This is what all the people who favored arming Ukraine all these years were telling Trump. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=675.74s)]
*  Putin's a bad guy, he can't be trusted, he wants this war, he doesn't value human life, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=681.1s)]
*  we have to protect the Ukrainians. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=684.42s)]
*  All of Maug was against this. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=686.22s)]
*  And Trump gets into office and he starts talking like Michael McFaul or Ann Applebaum or David [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=688.38s)]
*  Frum. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=695.7s)]
*  You could give Trump a New York, an Atlantic article, an Atlantic column with him saying [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=697.14s)]
*  this stuff about Ukraine, he would fit right in. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=702.58s)]
*  Here in addition to Trump talking about sanctions, which might just be a stick he's holding up [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=708.22s)]
*  to get Putin back to the negotiating table, the New York Times last week said this, quote, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=712.74s)]
*  lack of new US sanctions allows restricted goods and funds into Russia. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=717.5s)]
*  So the New York Times is complaining that there are no new US sanctions on Russia and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=722.5400000000001s)]
*  that's somehow helping them. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=727.1s)]
*  Now just to give you a sense, Trump is acting like he alone sees what Putin really is, he [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=729.7s)]
*  just discovered that Putin is not trustworthy. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=734.38s)]
*  This isn't to all what these neocons have been saying, all these people who are fanatical [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=737.22s)]
*  supporters of the war in Ukraine who have been accusing Trump of being a Putin asset [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=740.82s)]
*  or Russian asset because he won't support the Ukrainians. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=745.34s)]
*  Here's Michael McFaul, Obama's former ambassador to Russia, February 19th, 2025, quote, when [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=748.38s)]
*  it comes to Putin, Trump is out of step with the American people and overwhelming majority [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=754.26s)]
*  of voters, 81% think the United States should not trust Vladimir Putin, while 9% think the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=758.06s)]
*  United States should trust him. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=763.0999999999999s)]
*  Garry Kasparov, the anti-Putin fanatic who's a Russian chess player, said, quote, Trump [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=765.9399999999999s)]
*  said yesterday that he trusts Putin. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=771.9399999999999s)]
*  Making that fallacy clear now is important for all future decisions by the Trump administration, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=774.42s)]
*  whatever strange hold Putin has on him. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=778.3399999999999s)]
*  Trump doesn't like to be laughed at as a sucker, Musk won't be blamed, Trump will. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=780.9s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren, showing how bipartisan this is, March 3rd, first, Donald Trump blames [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=786.22s)]
*  Zelensky for Putin's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=790.58s)]
*  Then he says he, quote, trusts Putin. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=793.3s)]
*  Now he's frozen bipartisan military aid. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=794.9399999999999s)]
*  It's clear that Donald Trump is putting his fragile ego before our national security, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=797.66s)]
*  siding with Putin over US allies in Europe. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=801.14s)]
*  So Trump now sounds exactly like all of those people. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=806.18s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren, Michael McFaul, the whole gang. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=811.18s)]
*  Not just continuing their policy of arming Ukraine, but also talking about the rationale [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=815.4599999999999s)]
*  in exactly the same manner. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=822.1s)]
*  Here was Trump at just one of his countless campaign rallies where he talked about the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=825.02s)]
*  war in Ukraine. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=828.06s)]
*  This was September 24th, 2024, so barely a month before the election. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=829.64s)]
*  Here is what he said. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=836.0600000000001s)]
*  He was in Savannah, Georgia. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=837.34s)]
*  Biden and Kamala got us into this war in Ukraine and now they can't get us out. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=839.42s)]
*  They can't get us out. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=846.14s)]
*  I watched him. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=847.8199999999999s)]
*  We will win. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=848.8199999999999s)]
*  We will. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=850.02s)]
*  He's been saying that for three years. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=851.02s)]
*  Every time Zelensky comes to the United States, he walks away with a hundred billion dollars. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=854.46s)]
*  I think he's the greatest salesman on Earth. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=859.46s)]
*  But we're stuck. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=863.14s)]
*  Everybody booing. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=864.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh boo. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=865.9399999999999s)]
*  We don't want to give money to Zelensky. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=866.9399999999999s)]
*  No more arms to Ukraine, not like Joe Biden wants to do. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=868.34s)]
*  This is the MAGA faithful in Savannah, Georgia, and Trump is telling them that's how he thinks [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=871.9200000000001s)]
*  too. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=876.22s)]
*  In that war, unless I'm president, I'll get it done. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=877.22s)]
*  I'll get it negotiated. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=880.58s)]
*  I'll get out. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=881.58s)]
*  We got to get out. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=882.58s)]
*  Biden says we will not leave until we win. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=883.58s)]
*  What happens if they win? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=889.1600000000001s)]
*  That's what they do is they fight wars. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=891.7s)]
*  As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=895.18s)]
*  They beat Napoleon. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=897.4599999999999s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=898.8599999999999s)]
*  They fight. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=899.8599999999999s)]
*  And it's not pleasant, but we've given them close to $300 billion. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=900.8599999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=907.3399999999999s)]
*  Europe has given them, which is approximately our size when you add up the countries together, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=908.3399999999999s)]
*  their economy, it's very close to our size. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=912.66s)]
*  They've given them a small fraction of that number, just a small, very small fraction. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=915.38s)]
*  That wasn't true. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=921.18s)]
*  Europe hasn't given a very small fraction. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=922.5s)]
*  They may have given about half. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=924.34s)]
*  And I do think that's a valid complaint that Europeans should have paid more. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=926.22s)]
*  But the critique was you're not going to beat the Russians. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=929.7s)]
*  Russia is going to win eventually anyway. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=934.54s)]
*  We're draining our own citizenry to fund this war in Ukraine with no end in sight. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=936.7s)]
*  And Trump said, I'm going to get out. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=942.66s)]
*  And the audience booed when he mentioned that Biden wants to keep funding them and arming [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=944.9399999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=948.1s)]
*  And now that's Trump's policy. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=949.42s)]
*  Just like bombing Yemen was something that Trump criticized Biden for doing during the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=951.4599999999999s)]
*  campaign and then he did it and escalated it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=955.4599999999999s)]
*  He continuously warned that Obama was going to bomb Iran because there's no other go. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=959.78s)]
*  She can't get a deal done. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=965.26s)]
*  Trump then decides he can't get a deal done, bombs Iran. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=967.42s)]
*  Exactly what he mocked Obama for doing. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=969.62s)]
*  The Epstein files, obviously. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=974.26s)]
*  There's a lot going around that they're going to do an amnesty for a lot of people who are [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=977.14s)]
*  in the country illegally but work for interests that Donald Trump considers important. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=980.62s)]
*  And now here's Trump saying, yeah, we got to keep arming Ukraine because you can't trust [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_axBgTxTXY&t=986.0600000000001s)]
