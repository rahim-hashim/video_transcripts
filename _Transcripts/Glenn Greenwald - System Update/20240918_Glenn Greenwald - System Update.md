# Are Michigan Voters Ditching Dems? With Journalist Jordan Chariton
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0)
*  What the time that we have left I do want to ask you and we'll obviously put [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=0.0s)]
*  the the book which I highly recommend in our notes the link to it and and and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=10.98s)]
*  it'll be promoted as well as part of our show but speaking of Michigan since you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=16.4s)]
*  know that state I imagine almost as well as you do any other state at this point [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=22.52s)]
*  in the United States you've been spending a lot of time there this year as part [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=25.84s)]
*  of an attempt to understand how this crucial voting bloc in Michigan other [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  states as well but particularly Michigan which are Arab Americans and Muslim [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=34.76s)]
*  Americans are thinking about the US support for the role for the Israeli war [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=37.96s)]
*  in Gaza for Israel in general that has been supported basically limitlessly by [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=44.16s)]
*  Joe Biden and now by Kamala Harris and I wonder if you could give us a sense for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=49.6s)]
*  there's a lot of talk about people who wrote Democrat traditionally who aren't [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=54.64s)]
*  gonna vote for Democrats this time who might vote for Democrats if they see [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  something that they're unlikely to see who might vote for Jill Stein what is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=63.8s)]
*  your sense not just anecdotally but if you give us kind of a broader sense [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=67.04s)]
*  given how much time you spent there of what you've been hearing and what you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=71.64s)]
*  think is likely to happen in those communities. Yeah so Michigan I think has [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=74.0s)]
*  a lot more cascading factors than Pennsylvania or Wisconsin there is the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=80.4s)]
*  Arab American community in Dearborn there's also a decent Arab American [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=88.28s)]
*  population in the city of Detroit in Flint so people rightly focus on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  Dearborn because it's the largest but there there are decent Arab American [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=97.72s)]
*  population throughout Michigan and I was just in Debra on a few weeks ago after [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=102.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris you know replaced Joe Biden and the sentiment I was getting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=106.76s)]
*  and this was not from a few people this was from quite a lot was you know your [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=111.48s)]
*  sympathy is not going to stop the bombs and most people I spoke to either were [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  not voting in the presidential election or we're looking into Jill Stein or [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=122.0s)]
*  Cornel West and some of the top activists I spoke with talked about that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=127.12s)]
*  people they know are not going to vote for Kamala Harris of course this is not [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=133.6s)]
*  the entire Arab American population but that was a sentiment I was getting and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=138.16s)]
*  polls that have come out since then seem to support that outside of the Gaza [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=142.32s)]
*  issue you know I think Trump generally you know in this evolution of 2016 to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=147.76s)]
*  now both on the national level and state level but there's been a pattern of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=153.32s)]
*  under polling him and for whatever reason them missing his base by one to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=157.44s)]
*  2% and I think that would apply to Michigan as well because from what I'm [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=162.72s)]
*  seeing from interviews I did in Detroit in particular which traditionally if a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=166.6s)]
*  Democrats gonna win in Michigan they have to do very well in Detroit there's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=171.36s)]
*  a not insignificant number of black men that seem to be moving over to Trump [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=175.6s)]
*  variety of reasons but some of the men I spoke with it was as simple as you know [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=181.52s)]
*  prices were lower under Trump you know obviously there's context and different [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=186.44s)]
*  factors for that but they're not political diehards and they just look at [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=191.28s)]
*  it simply you know costs were lower under Trump and I'm tired of the high [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=194.72s)]
*  prices others had specifics they liked the child tax credit under Biden Harris [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=198.4s)]
*  but that was only for a year and they're mad it expired which goes to kind of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=204.8s)]
*  neoliberalism why would you create this program for a year and allow it to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=209.24s)]
*  sunset without fighting for it which you're talking to actual voters you [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=214.24s)]
*  know black voters Arab voters Muslim voters and one of the things that always [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=221.24s)]
*  strikes me is this gigantic gap between sort of the elite pundits who are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=224.72s)]
*  anointed or the NGO leaders or group leaders who are anointed to speak on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=229.56s)]
*  behalf of this people these people and the huge gap between what they insist is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=233.72s)]
*  important the way they'll have the prism through which they see things and the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  prism through which ordinary voters who aren't as politically connected who [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=241.34s)]
*  don't work as perfect political professionals see things as well and I [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  think a lot of times people do forget as they're watching the migration of black [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=248.16s)]
*  and Latino voters to the Republican Party despite all these claims that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=251.64s)]
*  Trump is a white supremacist is that these people have the same exact [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=255.28s)]
*  concern as everybody else including white ordinary voters which is they're [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=257.84s)]
*  worried about inflation they're worried about health care costs they're worried [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=261.0s)]
*  about the the economy for their kids and and you know I don't know that they're [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=263.64s)]
*  so focused on these kind of racially divisive issues that oftentimes are [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=268.56s)]
*  emphasized by the elite to our self-anointed to speak for them and we [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=274.6s)]
*  see that in polls we see that a lot of the journalism you're doing let me ask [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  you the last question um I think part of the Biden Harris strategy heading into [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  the 2024 election because remember now we're a full year into the war in Gaza [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=288.72s)]
*  is they really assumed that the war would end before the election so it [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=291.8s)]
*  kind of be on the back burner it would be out of people's minds or at the very [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  least they could pressure the Israelis to try and end it before the election [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=299.72s)]
*  I mean they've been claimed this kind of breakthrough that they did on behalf of the people in Gaza I think they're still trying that but I don't think [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=303.7s)]
*  the Israelis care very much about what the Biden Harris administration thinks [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  they've demonstrated that multiple times I certainly don't think they care about [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=313.94s)]
*  their political prospects in fact they would love to probably see them lose [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=316.86s)]
*  which is ironic since they've been so loyal to them but leave that aside [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  since this war does not seem to be ending anytime soon certainly not before [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=324.3s)]
*  the election and now we have things like an expanding war this this horrific [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  attack today in Lebanon by Israel do you think that the more that kind of happens [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=331.7s)]
*  with Israel and its neighbors and these conflicts and wars the worst this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=337.78s)]
*  problem gets for Democrats when it comes to Muslim and Arab voters who had [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=341.21999999999997s)]
*  traditionally supported the party yes and I also think going back to black [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=344.74s)]
*  voters I spoke with people also are just kind of sick of spending all this money [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=352.34s)]
*  everywhere else as their groceries are $200 for just a few items I've spoken [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=357.1s)]
*  with so many not just black voters but all voters in Michigan and elsewhere who [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=362.94s)]
*  are like why are we giving all this money to Ukraine and Israel and etc but [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=368.74s)]
*  you know prices gas is a little lower now but it's been high groceries I mean [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=373.06s)]
*  housing rent so not just on the moral aspect I think that train has left the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  station I think if there's there was a ceasefire announced today they would [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=385.26s)]
*  still lose a significant portion of the Arab American population understandably [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=389.26s)]
*  so I mean I spoke with people in Dearborn that have left lost 15 to 20 [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=393.86s)]
*  family members but then again but then on top of that there's the financial and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=397.86s)]
*  pocketbook issues of people are just sick of spending all this money and being [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=404.18s)]
*  told you know we have to do this to save democracy and the world alliance because [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=408.34s)]
*  they don't care about that they care about food on the table so I think if [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=414.42s)]
*  this continues I think it could be the deciding issue the defining issue that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=417.06s)]
*  reelects Trump and defeats Harris I totally agree and I mean I think they're [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=422.5s)]
*  right to care more about the issues that affect them in their immediate [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=426.18s)]
*  neighborhoods in their lives and their lives of their children then some foreign [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=428.86s)]
*  wars overseas so they're told for some reason they have to pay for Jordan the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=432.1s)]
*  book is we the poison exposing the Flint water crisis cover-up and the poisoning [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=435.46000000000004s)]
*  of a hundred thousand Americans I think the thing I appreciate most about your [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=439.74s)]
*  book is that you are somebody who despite whatever ideological views that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=443.14s)]
*  you have when it comes to your reporting you just follow it wherever it goes [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=447.78s)]
*  whose ever doorstep it lands at and I think that's what journalism is missing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=451.18s)]
*  more than anything and I think you do that extremely well and I think like I [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=454.34s)]
*  said this book is kind of an insight not just in the Flint water crisis but to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=457.14s)]
*  the problems with our US political house in general so congratulations on writing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=460.94s)]
*  it and thanks so much for coming on talk about it I appreciate it hey thank you [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGyONs5bbs0&t=463.82s)]
