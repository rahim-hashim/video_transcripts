# Oscar-Winning Film CENSORED in the U.S.?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I)
*  Last night, the film No Other Land won the Oscar for Best Documentary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=0.0s)]
*  The film, which stars Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham and Palestinian activist Baso Adra, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=11.88s)]
*  chronicles the occupation and destruction of Masafir Yatah, a Palestinian village in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=17.88s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=23.0s)]
*  The film has been described as a testimony to friendship, solidarity, and resistance. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=24.32s)]
*  While much of the film documents Israeli attempts at land grabs and violence from Israeli military [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=29.64s)]
*  and settler forces from 2019 through 2023, it also juxtaposes snippets from old videos [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=34.76s)]
*  recorded by Adra's family and neighbors. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=40.72s)]
*  No Other Land features footage of protests filmed by Baso Adra when he was just seven [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=43.4s)]
*  years old. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  As he sits with his mother in a field, his father is violently assaulted and then arrested [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=49.38s)]
*  by the Israeli army. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=53.72s)]
*  Here's a clip from the trailer. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=54.72s)]
*  The Masafir Yatah is the place I grew up in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=84.72s)]
*  The beginning of my photography is the beginning of our end. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=87.72s)]
*  Do you hear that? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=93.72s)]
*  I'm dead! [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=99.72s)]
*  I'm claiming my life. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=115.72s)]
*  This is what's happening in my village now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=139.72s)]
*  Soldiers are everywhere. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=141.72s)]
*  I'm not a soldier! [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=144.72s)]
*  It would be nice if you could come and visit me. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=154.72s)]
*  You can come and visit me later. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=159.72s)]
*  I'm not visiting you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=161.72s)]
*  Or not? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=164.72s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=170.72s)]
*  I want to make a movie. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=171.72s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=201.72s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=202.72s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=203.72s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=204.72s)]
*  We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=229.72s)]
*  because together our voices are stronger. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=233.72s)]
*  We see each other. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=237.72s)]
*  The atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=240.72s)]
*  The Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7th, which must be freed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=244.72s)]
*  When I look at Basel, I see my brother, but we are unequal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=249.72s)]
*  We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law, and Basel is under military laws [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=254.72s)]
*  that destroy his life and he cannot control. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=259.72s)]
*  There is a different path, a political solution, without ethnic supremacy, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=262.72s)]
*  with national rights for both of our people. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=267.72s)]
*  And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=270.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=284.72s)]
*  Can't you see that we are intertwined? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=285.72s)]
*  That my people can be truly safe if Basel's people are truly free and safe. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=287.72s)]
*  There is another way. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=293.72s)]
*  It's not too late for life, for the living. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=297.72s)]
*  There is no other way. Thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=300.72s)]
*  Rachel Schorr, Hamdan Balal, Igalia Huda, Plaza Peniserev. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=303.72s)]
*  Now here's the rub. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=307.72s)]
*  Every other film awarded an Oscar last night had US distribution. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=309.72s)]
*  No other land, despite winning the most prestigious accolade in Hollywood, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=314.72s)]
*  could not obtain a US distributor. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=318.72s)]
*  It is only shown in small and independent theaters. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=320.72s)]
*  Hopefully this award changes that, but the situation reflects an ongoing form of systemic censorship in American media. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=323.72s)]
*  Here's how the New York Times described the dynamic. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=330.72s)]
*  Despite a string of honors and rave reviews, no distributor would pick up the film in the United States, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=333.72s)]
*  making it nearly impossible for American filmgoers to see it in theaters or to stream it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=339.72s)]
*  This shortcoming made no other land part of a broader trend in recent years [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=344.72s)]
*  in which topical documentaries have struggled to secure distribution. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=349.72s)]
*  Now this claim about quote unquote topical documentaries struggling to obtain distribution obscures the reality. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=353.72s)]
*  Let's take a look at the last decade or so of Oscar winning documentaries. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=362.72s)]
*  The winner last year, 20 Days in Maripol, about Ukrainian forces fighting Russians, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=366.72s)]
*  that's a film that certainly revolved around a topical issue area, and yes, they had a major distributor. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=371.72s)]
*  The year before that, the best documentary went to Navalny about the Russian dissident, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=379.72s)]
*  another topical documentary that again had a distributor, in this case Warner Brothers. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=384.72s)]
*  In 2019, the winner was the film produced by the Obamas, American factory, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=389.72s)]
*  about a Chinese owned factory in Ohio and its struggle with union organizers and a culture clash about the nature of work. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=394.72s)]
*  Again, no problem finding a distributor. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=400.72s)]
*  Even the very controversial documentary Citizen Four about Edward Snowden, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=403.72s)]
*  which featured our esteemed host Glenn Grunwald, which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2014, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=408.72s)]
*  that film, which enraged the U.S. national security state, had a major distributor and the film was widely shown in U.S. theaters. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=414.72s)]
*  No, the issue is not topical documentaries failing to obtain distribution or streaming deals. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=421.72s)]
*  The issue is the aggressive and often successful attempt by pro-Israel pressure groups to prevent audiences from viewing films that are critical of Israel. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=427.72s)]
*  We've seen pressure campaigns for Netflix to remove Farha, the Jordanian film about atrocities committed during the 1948 war in Israel. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=436.72s)]
*  There have been similar challenges for other films critical of Israel, including Tantura, 200 Meters, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=444.72s)]
*  Little Palestine, Diary of Siege, and Nailah and the Uprising. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=450.72s)]
*  Recently, the Israeli doc, the American documentary Israelism, produced by left leaning American Jews, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=454.72s)]
*  investigates how American Jewish communities educate their members about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=460.72s)]
*  often in ways that erase the existence of Palestinians. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=466.72s)]
*  The film has faced an ongoing campaign of censorship. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=470.72s)]
*  The University of Pennsylvania refused to allow a Jewish student group to screen the movie, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=473.72s)]
*  and Hunter College similarly canceled a screening. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=478.72s)]
*  Eventually, Hunter College allowed a screening, but only if a rabbi was featured to host a discussion after the film. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=481.72s)]
*  And he was criticized for refusing to take student questions. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=488.72s)]
*  Screenings for the film have been blocked in other colleges and universities since October 7th. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=492.72s)]
*  The other incredible example of film censorship that really has no parallel in recent modern American history [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=498.72s)]
*  is that of Al Jazeera's explosive documentary, The Lobby. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=505.72s)]
*  This multi-part series featured an undercover reporter who infiltrated a pro-Israel lobbying group [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=509.72s)]
*  with a hidden camera and gained unprecedented access to strategy sessions from a constellation of pro-Israel organizations [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=515.72s)]
*  that touted their work covertly censoring, surveilling, and intimidating American activists and student groups. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=522.72s)]
*  The film also shows the close coordination with the Israeli government. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=529.72s)]
*  Regular meetings with the Israeli embassy, along with explicit direction and support from Israeli intelligence groups operating in the US. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=533.72s)]
*  Let's watch a brief clip from the film. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=541.72s)]
*  We are all on the defensive, and I think we should move to the offensive. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=543.72s)]
*  Using especially cyber and internet tools to try and defeat this ugly movement. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=549.72s)]
*  I'm really honored to present my partners here, Brigadier General Sima Vapendil, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=563.72s)]
*  the Director General of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs, Sima Vapendil. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=569.72s)]
*  The fact that the Israeli government decided to be a key player means a lot, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=580.72s)]
*  because we can bring things that usually are not existing in NGOs or civilian entities that are now enrolled in this thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=585.72s)]
*  The Israeli government can look at the big picture and actually create this coordination and cooperation. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=601.72s)]
*  But this explosive film was removed from the internet in 2018. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=606.72s)]
*  In 2018, as the Qatari government, which funds Al Jazeera, faced a military blockade from the Saudi Arabian and UAE government, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=610.72s)]
*  negotiated a settlement of that conflict, Max Blumenthal and others reported that as part of the deal with the US, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=619.72s)]
*  along with the first Trump administration, they called for removing the lobby film in exchange for it lifting the blockade and restoring normal relations. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=626.72s)]
*  Pro-Israel organizations with influence with the Trump administration, who were angered by the film and its many exposés, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=635.72s)]
*  helped play a key role in the negotiations. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=642.72s)]
*  And finally, I have my own story to tell that has not been previously reported. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=645.72s)]
*  In 2023, I worked with a Norwegian film company to produce Praying for Armageddon, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=650.72s)]
*  a documentary about the role of Christian Zionism in fueling the crisis in Israel. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=655.72s)]
*  Many pro-Israel lawmakers here in the US and policymakers have explicitly endorsed the removal of Palestinians from Israel [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=660.72s)]
*  and encouraged violent conflict as part of their interpretation of a biblical doomsday prophecy [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=668.72s)]
*  in which the second coming of Christ requires Jewish control of the Holy Land and a new world war that ends up killing or converting the world's Jewish population. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=674.72s)]
*  While it may sound like an anti-Jewish belief system, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=683.72s)]
*  some of these Christian Zionists and allied pro-Israel groups encourage this belief because it builds American support for Israel's continued expulsion of Palestinians from their homes and communities. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=686.72s)]
*  Here's a brief clip from the movie. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=698.72s)]
*  We're talking to members of Congress about Israel and the US's relationship. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=707.72s)]
*  The US has an intrinsic interest in making sure that Israel not only receives our best prayers and offers of success, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=711.72s)]
*  but our armaments, our money, and our ability to make sure that in a very dangerous reason, this democracy survives. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=725.72s)]
*  There are some biblical prophecies that say that control of Jerusalem by the Jews is important for the second coming of Christ. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=734.72s)]
*  This entire matter is based upon faith of our Maker, of our Creator, but it's also faith of a chosen people. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=742.72s)]
*  Can you ask why the Democrats are using our law enforcement officers as political pawns? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=754.72s)]
*  The Democrats who have been campaigning to defund our law enforcement as their people, BLM and Antifa, riot and loot in the streets. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=759.72s)]
*  There's a new government in Israel. Can you talk a little bit about the importance of the US relationship with Israel? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=769.72s)]
*  There have been two nations created to glorify God, Israel and the United States of America. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=776.72s)]
*  I will bless both, I will honor both, I will do all I can to stand and defend them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=783.72s)]
*  Thank you, Congresswoman. Take care. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=789.72s)]
*  Here, again, it was virtually impossible to find a single US distributor or streaming partner. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=792.72s)]
*  Many European television networks and distributors showed the film. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=798.72s)]
*  However, after months and months, no one here in America said yes. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=802.72s)]
*  And I can say that again, fear of angering pro-Israel pressure groups played a major role in why this film could not find a single American platform, a streaming network or a distributor. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I&t=806.72s)]
