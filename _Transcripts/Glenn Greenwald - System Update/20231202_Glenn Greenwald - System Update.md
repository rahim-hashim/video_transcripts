# Round 2: Taibbi/Shellenberger *Clash* w/ Censorship Regime
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4)
*  If you stop and think about it, it's actually quite amazing that there have now been not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=0.0s)]
*  one but two federal court cases holding exactly the same thing that the Biden administration [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=11.6s)]
*  engaged in one of the most serious, one of the gravest direct frontal attacks on the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=17.88s)]
*  free speech guarantee of the First Amendment by continuously not just pressuring or coercing, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=23.96s)]
*  but threatening big tech companies that they must censor a wide variety of political speech that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=30.68s)]
*  are disliked by various agencies in the Biden administration, including the FBI, the CDC, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=38.56s)]
*  and others, including the Biden White House. Or else, the Biden administration said, and for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  failure to censor that content, these companies will suffer all sorts of legal and retaliatory [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=50.24s)]
*  reprisals. Obviously, the executive branch has enormous control over big tech and punish them [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=55.64s)]
*  in all sorts of ways. And with regarding numerous crises, there has been all sorts of censorship [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=60.96s)]
*  that nominally was implemented by big tech, but in fact was pressured and cajoled and directed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=66.8s)]
*  by the Biden administration. And there's all kinds of case law we've covered before, which holds that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=77.04s)]
*  the federal government cannot indirectly censor what they would be barred constitutionally from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  censoring, meaning they can't threaten private actors to censor for them. And yet that's exactly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  what the Biden administration has done. And the court was clear, first the district court and then [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=93.2s)]
*  the three judge appellate court, that this is not some small or tactical violation of the First [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=98.84s)]
*  Amendment. According to the court, this is one of the gravest violations arguably in the history [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=104.6s)]
*  of the judiciary to take the internet and try and systematically censor it in this manner. And yet [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=109.55999999999999s)]
*  there's been almost no media coverage of this. The people who claim to be the safeguards and the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=115.88s)]
*  guardians of American democracy who have been found to have been supporting this have said [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=122.52s)]
*  almost nothing. Media outlets have barely covered this at all. And so just this week, the independent [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=128.28s)]
*  journalist Matt Taibbi and Michael Schellenberger, which who have done great work in exposing a lot [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=136.16s)]
*  of the censorship regime, including the Twitter files, published a new joint article, investigative [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=139.8s)]
*  article that is also byline by Alex Gudentag at the joint substack that they have to publish these [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=145.08s)]
*  articles. And there you see the article on the screen is from the CTI files number one, they have a whistleblower. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=154.44s)]
*  And the title is US and UK military contractors created a sweeping plan for global global censorship in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=159.6s)]
*  2018. New documents show a whistleblower makes troves of new documents available to public and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=167.04s)]
*  racket showing the birth of the censorship industrial complex in reaction to Brexit and Trump [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=173.32s)]
*  election in 2016. Now, this is the key point. The history of censorship is exactly this. This type of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=178.72s)]
*  censorship really did not exist prior to 2016. It's all new. Of course, there were some big tech [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=187.16s)]
*  censorship here and there. But for the most part, the entire system and the vast bulk of what we're [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=194.36s)]
*  discussing, people being banned off off the internet for their political speech really emerged in the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=199.28s)]
*  wake of 2016. And that's because the Western establishment suffered two severe blows in 2016. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  First, when subjects of the United Kingdom, a majority of them voted to leave the EU by approving the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=211.84s)]
*  Brexit referendum. And then just a few short months later, when they delivered the real traumatic [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=219.6s)]
*  blow, which was rejecting Hillary Clinton and electing Donald Trump to the Oval Office. And in the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=225.12s)]
*  wake of those two events, Western elites, especially American elites decided that the internet can no [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=230.6s)]
*  longer be free that once the internet is free, people are free to make up their own minds and no [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=236.76s)]
*  longer under the control of Western elite. And that's when they began to implement this systemic [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=242.04s)]
*  censorship regime as a way of getting people under control to control the flow of information that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  they can receive, which in turn allows them to control behavior. That is why I spend so much time [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=251.04s)]
*  in this issue why it's such a central cause of mine. If you can dictate what populations can and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=256.16s)]
*  can't hear, that is a level of control and authoritarianism that makes elections irrelevant. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  Because if people are going and voting for who they're told to vote for because they've only been [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=269.92s)]
*  allowed to hear the information that power centers want them to hear, which is what the system is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=274.24s)]
*  designed to do, the elections are basically illusory. That's why the First Amendment of the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=279.12s)]
*  Constitution guaranteed free speech, really in so many ways, is one of the rights on which all the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=285.76s)]
*  others depend. And here's what they write, quote, a whistleblower has come forward with an explosive [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=292.24s)]
*  new trove of documents rivaling or exceeding the Twitter files and Facebook files in scale and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=298.96s)]
*  importance. They describe the activities of a quote anti-disinformation group called the Cyber [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=303.76s)]
*  Threat Intelligence League or CTIL that officially began as the volunteer project with data scientists [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=309.36s)]
*  and defense and intelligence veterans, but whose tactics over time appear to have been absorbed [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=317.36s)]
*  into multiple official projects, including those of the Department of Homeland Security. Now, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  remember the whole emergence of the disinformation industry, the people who are disinformation [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=328.32s)]
*  experts who decree what is disinformation and what is not to allow big tech to censor to allow [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=332.96s)]
*  governments to justify or demand that censorship quickly emerged overnight. There is no expertise [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=338.56s)]
*  called a disinformation expert. That is a concocted and made up field of discipline. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=347.12s)]
*  And it emerged in order to justify the censorship regime to make it seem like it was the byproduct [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=352.56s)]
*  of data analysis rather than what it is, which is suppression of political speech based on ideology. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=357.84s)]
*  Quote, lock your shit down, explains one document about creating quote your spy disguise. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  Another explains that while such activities overseas are quote typically done by the CIA and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=370.96s)]
*  NSA and the Department of Defense, censorship efforts against Americans have to be done using [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=375.44s)]
*  private partners because the government doesn't have the quote legal authority. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=380.64s)]
*  The whistleblower alleges that a leader of the CTI League, a former British intelligence analyst, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=385.12s)]
*  was quote in the room at the Obama White House in 2017 when she received the instructions to create [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=390.72s)]
*  a counter disinformation project to stop a repeat of 2016. Now a larger trove of new documents, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=396.16s)]
*  including strategy documents, training videos, presentations and internal messages reveal that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  in 2019, US and UK military and intelligence contractors led by a former UK defense attorney [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=408.72s)]
*  named Sarah Jane S.J. Terp developed this sweeping censorship framework. Those contractors co-led [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=414.16s)]
*  CTIL, which partnered with CISA in the spring of 2020, that is the department inside the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=421.68s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security. CTIL's ultimate goal, said the whistleblower, quote, was to become [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  part of the federal government. In our weekly meetings, they made it clear they were building [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=432.8s)]
*  these organizations within the federal government, and if you built the first iteration, we could [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  secure a job for you. Terp's plan, which she shared in presentations to information security [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=442.48s)]
*  and cyber security groups in 2019, was to create, quote, misinfosec communities that would include [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=446.96s)]
*  government. This is the creation of the disinformation industry right before your eyes, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  which in turn is intended to provide a justification, a cover, a pretext for how Big Tech censors [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=460.64s)]
*  political speech at the dictates of the government, not by claiming that it is [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=468.8s)]
*  suppressing ideological dissent, but instead disinformation. Who wants false claims being [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=474.8s)]
*  circulated? The problem, of course, is that the people who are in control of determining [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=479.92s)]
*  what is true and false are the government officials themselves. That's in whose hands [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  this censorship regime resides. Now, CTIL's plan was to create a new system [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  here is a video of Congressman Dan Bishop, who's a Republican on the committee, and we're going to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  include this because he provides such an impassioned and clear and articulate summary of what has [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=506.16s)]
*  happened with these judicial findings about the Biden administration directly violating free speech [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  in a systematic way. And the witness who's on this panel with Schellenberger and Tehibi [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  is named Olivia Troye. She's a former advisor to former Vice President Mike Pence, who has decided [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=526.08s)]
*  to rebrand as an anti-Trump conservative. She goes around talking about how dangerous Donald Trump is. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=531.36s)]
*  And so they had her there, the Democrats did. The Democrats often ignored Tehibi and Schellenberger, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=538.4s)]
*  didn't want to hear about this censorship regime, of course, to have Olivia Troye, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=543.44s)]
*  Vice President Pence's former aide, talk about the evils of Trump. But in doing so, she also, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=548.4s)]
*  they ripped her in into defending the censorship regime. So listen to Congressman Bishop. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=553.28s)]
*  You're aware that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has reviewed that, found that the findings [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=558.4s)]
*  of the district court were well supported by evidence and modified and substantially [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=562.88s)]
*  affirmed the preliminary injunction against the government entered by. Are you aware of all that? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=568.48s)]
*  And does it affect your view that all of this is a figment of imagination? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=573.36s)]
*  I am aware of the decision. I also want to clarify that I have not actually, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=577.84s)]
*  did never said that this is a conspiracy. You've not heard that comment from me. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=585.12s)]
*  So you believe there's there is censorship going on by means of the federal government on social [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=588.88s)]
*  media platforms or has been? I can only speak to my experience and I will say that I've sat in a [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=593.2s)]
*  lot of these interagency meetings with social media companies and ultimately it was their decision. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=597.84s)]
*  Okay, so that already is an incredible omission if you think about it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=602.88s)]
*  She as Vice President Pence's representative in these intra-agency meetings with the National [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=608.88s)]
*  Security State was frequently sitting in on meetings where the U.S. government would meet [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  with Big Tech and would instruct Big Tech on what content they wanted censored. This wasn't the Trump [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=620.4s)]
*  administration or Biden political actors in this case doing it. It was the CIA and the FBI and the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=629.04s)]
*  CDC trying to remove content that they disliked. And in order to defend this, because she's there [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=634.88s)]
*  as a Democratic Party witness, she tries to say ultimately it was the tech companies that pushed [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  the delete button or the censor button. But of course the courts found that they did so at the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=645.36s)]
*  direction of the federal government. And ultimately it was their decision and I will say that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=651.28s)]
*  when content was removed it was ultimately up to them. We followed. Yeah, but see that's what the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  court has said is the problem is that the agencies have engaged in this subterfuge where they say [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  well we want you to make the decision but they're all over them to the point that their constant [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  involvement makes it government involvement. That's the threat. Mr. Schellenberger, let me [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=675.36s)]
*  turn to you because I was thinking about where we are. Twitter files revealed these connections, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=680.48s)]

*  companies. And then your further reporting and yours Mr. Taibbi revealed the next layer which [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=691.12s)]
*  is what you call the censorship industrial complex. The connection between CISA funding these adjacent [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=696.24s)]
*  agencies, people at Stanford, people at the University of Washington. And so they could [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=702.24s)]
*  offload this exact subterfuge and they could pre-bunk stuff and stop whole narratives from [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  taking hold. And now your CTI league shows yet another dynamic in two ways it seems. You've got [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=714.8s)]
*  this guy, we want to get his name out there for folks, Pablo Brewer you said, a commander with [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=722.7199999999999s)]
*  the special operations command I believe and he's involved in this CTI league but they got [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  Israeli, you mentioned British intelligence, and you say this in part of your report the authors, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=735.4399999999999s)]
*  and talking about one of their reports, advocated for police, military, and intelligence involvement [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=740.72s)]
*  in censorship across five eyes nations and even suggested that Interpol should be involved. Why [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=745.52s)]
*  is that significant Mr. Schellenberger? Because it's not blinding the obvious. Do it as quickly [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=753.2s)]
*  as you can because I've got one other thing I really want to get to if we can. Well because [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean we don't want the police and the military to decide what we can say and read and that's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=763.36s)]
*  what makes our country amazing is that our founding fathers they said speech comes, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=770.1600000000001s)]
*  it's the first amendment, it comes before governments where it's not in Europe, the king [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=774.96s)]
*  would decide whether you could say things. We didn't want it that way, we said we want to decide. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=780.0s)]
*  Here's what it tells me that's chilling. Ms. Subramanya, I'm reminded of your presence here as [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=784.32s)]
*  a Canadian. So if they can't do it directly from the FBI then they get institutions, academic, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  pseudo-academic institutions involved. If they find that that's going to be blunted because we [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  can go take their funding away because there's US agency funding then they get the five eyes involved. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=798.96s)]
*  If they can't stop it here in the United States they can go get the European Union or the other [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=803.6s)]
*  governments to say we're not or Canada to deem this stuff to be threatening. That's what in the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=808.0s)]
*  dynamic deepens and deepens. This is a big deal and here we are every person on the minority side [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=814.4000000000001s)]
*  has talked about Donald Trump. I would think Ms. Troy and others that if you're concerned, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=819.76s)]
*  if you're genuinely concerned about Donald Trump as a threat, what we're talking about today should [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=824.8s)]
*  be all the more threatening to you because we're talking about setting precedents in diminishing [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=830.16s)]
*  the ability of Americans to express themselves. Why? Why is it that only Republicans in Congress [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=835.12s)]
*  are willing to say this? You know obviously I've been accused many times over the years [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=843.4399999999999s)]
*  of having switched sides or moved to the right and I'm listening to this and it describes in [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=851.2s)]
*  detail how the US security state in the five eyes countries which is the subject of the Snowden [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=859.04s)]
*  reporting, the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, that's the five eyes alliance, the spying [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=864.32s)]
*  alliance are working with outside contractors, military contractors to create systems [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=869.84s)]
*  to explicitly with the goal of controlling speech on the internet. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=876.24s)]
*  And the only people who care in the slightest about this in the Congress, the only people who [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=881.68s)]
*  are willing to object to it are conservatives like Congressman Bishop. While every single time this [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=885.76s)]
*  arises, this topic, Democrats don't just ignore it, they affirmatively defend it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=893.04s)]
*  And so yes, I'm a defender of free speech, I'm opposed to the US security state's censorship of [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=900.08s)]
*  the internet in conjunction with large corporations and neoliberal billionaire funded [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  disinformation agents. How does this become a right wing principle? How does this become a right [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=913.44s)]
*  wing cause? Why is Matt Taibbi on the right? Because he's reporting on the efforts of Western [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=919.0400000000001s)]
*  military agencies and law enforcement agencies and security state agencies to control speech on the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=926.0s)]
*  internet. The last time they were there, it was extraordinary to watch as every single Democrat, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=931.84s)]
*  every last one of them on this committee, including AOC and Dan Goldman and that non-voting [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=939.04s)]
*  delegate who pretends she's a congresswoman, Stacey Plaskett, every last one of them, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=946.64s)]
*  Colin Allred, affirmatively defended the right of the CIA and Homeland Security and the FBI to determine what content [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=950.8s)]
*  shouldn't be on the internet. This is what left liberals do in the Congress. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=963.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to show you one more exchange here. This is with Dan Goldman. This wasn't on the censorship [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=970.0799999999999s)]
*  issue itself, but it was on the fact that right before the 2020 election, the CIA created an [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=977.04s)]
*  outright lie, which was that the material from the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=985.68s)]
*  a lie that was ratified by the corporate media. We've been over that many times [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=992.24s)]
*  because what Taibbi and Schellenberger are saying is that this new censorship program is designed to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  manipulate and interfere in the 2024 election that's coming up. It's designed to [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1001.2s)]
*  propagandize the public to make sure they vote how they want, which is of course to make sure [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1008.08s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't get re-elected and Joe Biden does. And here's Dan Goldman, I think, in a very [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1012.32s)]
*  kind of futile and pathetic way even trying to engage Michael Schellenberger on the question [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  of whether we really know for sure whether the Hunter Biden laptop, all this time later, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  when everyone, even the newspapers that he agrees with, like the New York Times that [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1029.2s)]
*  is responsible for his election by endorsing it because the Salzberger family that owns it [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1033.3600000000001s)]
*  is friends with his billionaire family, of which he's an heir, even the New York Times [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1037.92s)]
*  acknowledges that the Hunter Biden laptop is completely authentic, not Russian disinformation. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1044.0s)]
*  And here's Dan Goldman not ready to acknowledge that, in fact, fighting tooth and nail to cling [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1048.0s)]
*  to this conspiracy theory that somehow it was manufactured or fraudulent. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1054.48s)]
*  Talked about the Hunter Biden laptop and how the FBI knew it existed. You are aware, of course, that [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1059.44s)]
*  the laptop, so to speak, was actually, that was published in the New York Post, was actually a [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1067.3600000000001s)]
*  hard drive that the New York Post admitted here was not authenticated as real. It was not the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1072.72s)]
*  laptop the FBI had. You're aware of that, right? It was the same contents. How do you know? Because [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1079.92s)]
*  it's the same. I mean, you would have to authenticate it to know it was the same contents. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  You have no idea. You know hard drives can be manipulated. Are you suggesting the New York [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1091.44s)]
*  Post could participate in a conspiracy to construct the contents of the Hunter Biden laptop? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1095.52s)]
*  No, sir. The problem is that hard drives can be manipulated by Rudy Giuliani or Russia. What's [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1100.64s)]
*  the evidence that that happened? Well, there is actual evidence of it, but the point is it's [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1105.6000000000001s)]
*  not the same. There's no evidence for it. So you're engaging in a conspiracy theory. I'm glad you agree with me, Mr. Schellenberger, that transparency [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1109.76s)]
*  is the most important thing. And my last question for you is, do you think it would be transparent [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1116.0s)]
*  if Hunter Biden came to this Congress and testified in a public hearing and more [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1122.0s)]
*  transparent than if he testified privately? It's, I mean, literally, I've never thought about that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1127.04s)]
*  I have no idea. You don't know? I've literally never thought about that. Public testimony, more transparent than private testimony? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1132.16s)]
*  Are you familiar with the First Amendment? Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Congress shall take no action to abridge [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1137.28s)]
*  freedom of speech. Yeah. And that's what you just described. Mr. Schellenberger, is 13 percent censorship [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1143.6s)]
*  still censorship? Absolutely. And the other 87 percent is what we call the chilling effect that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1149.04s)]
*  the courts have long recognized that they engaged in. That is the problem. There's a broad, by the way, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1154.3999999999999s)]
*  part of the operation, Congresswoman Goldman, part of the operation was to change the terms of service. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1160.0s)]
*  So you see them constantly trying to change the terms of service. You see them, it was 35 percent [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1165.44s)]
*  of all of the URLs that were going to EIP were labeled. So there it is. I mean, it was mostly [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1170.96s)]
*  the Democrats on the hearing decided to ignore this reporting in order to talk to Mike Pence's [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1178.56s)]
*  aide to talk about all the ways Donald Trump is dangerous. And that is their posture. They defend it, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1184.96s)]
*  they ignore it. And I think it is amazing that we have two court hearings now [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1189.36s)]
*  preliminary finding that the Biden administration engaged in this mass constitutional violation. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1198.4799999999998s)]
*  And of course, the people who care so much about American democracy have no interest at all in [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV62utJJX4&t=1202.7199999999998s)]
