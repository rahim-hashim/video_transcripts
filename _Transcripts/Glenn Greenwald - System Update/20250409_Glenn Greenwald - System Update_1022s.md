# Tucker Carlson & Charlie Kirk's WARNING Against War with Iran
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8)
*  Here was Trump yesterday also at the White House sitting next to Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=0.0s)]
*  when he was asked about Iran and Trump has said look I hope to get a deal with [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=12.24s)]
*  Iran remember there was a deal with Iran that Obama negotiated with the Iranians [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=19.68s)]
*  with the help of the Russians that provided for inspections of their nuclear [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=23.72s)]
*  facilities and Trump thought that was an inadequate deal so he ran on a campaign [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=28.44s)]
*  promise in 2016 to pull out of it and then did so now there's no more deal [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=34.28s)]
*  with the Iranians there's no more inspectors that was the framework that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=38.52s)]
*  we had that was nullified in the first term because the Israelis hated that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=42.44s)]
*  deal so Trump is now saying look I'd like to get another deal with them a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  better deal for them to dismantle their nuclear program to prove to us they've [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=52.56s)]
*  exploded it things in Iran will never do its form essentially humiliation [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=57.84s)]
*  but he says we don't have much time and if they don't quickly enter to a deal [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  with us this is what's going to happen. I think if the talks aren't successful [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=65.44s)]
*  with Iran I think Iran is going to be in great danger and I hate to say it great [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=70.48s)]
*  danger because they can't have a nuclear weapon you know it's not a complicated [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=77.0s)]
*  formula Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon that's all there is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  right now we have countries that have nuclear power that shouldn't have it but [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=86.36s)]
*  I'm sure we'll be able to negotiate out of that too as part of this later on down [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=92.8s)]
*  the line but Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and if the talks are successful I [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=97.32s)]
*  actually think it'll be a very bad day for Iran if that's the case yeah. So [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=105.36s)]
*  that's not really a veiled threat that's very explicit threat saying look [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  you know either Iran agrees to a deal or we're gonna you know make Iran it's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=116.8s)]
*  gonna be a very bad day for Iran it's gonna be a very dangerous situation for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=123.72s)]
*  Iran obviously threatening to bomb them which is what the Israelis have been [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=127.8s)]
*  trying to get the United States to do forever remember Trump's already paying [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=132.24s)]
*  for the Israeli war in Gaza he resumed and then escalated Biden's campaign of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=136.44s)]
*  bombing the Houthis in Yemen you'll see that yesterday he talked about deploying [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=141.28s)]
*  American troops to Gaza to basically clear it out of all Palestinians also an [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=147.2s)]
*  Israeli dream putting actual American troops on the ground in the Middle East [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=152.2s)]
*  and now he's talking about bombing Iran hear from Reuters on March 30th he's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=154.96s)]
*  been doing this for a while Trump threatens a bombing if Iran does not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=162.44s)]
*  make a nuclear deal quote in Trump's first remarks since Iran rejected [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=165.8s)]
*  direct negotiations with Washington last week he told NBC News that the US and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=169.04s)]
*  Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate quote if they don't make a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=173.16s)]
*  deal there will be bombing Trump said in a telephone interview quote it will be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=176.16s)]
*  bombing the likes of which they have never seen before there's a chance that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=180.56s)]
*  if they don't make a deal that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=185.04s)]
*  years ago he added now I understand very well that Trump threatens things in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  negotiations he you read the art of the deal that's very basic to it it's not [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=196.68s)]
*  just Trump that's what people do I used to be a litigator people say either you [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=202.28s)]
*  settle we're gonna litigate against you until the end of time we're gonna [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=206.36s)]
*  bankrupt you we're gonna destroy you you have to put the other side in some kind [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=210.44s)]
*  of fear to incentivize and gain leverage in negotiations that I totally understand [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  but the United States can't go around promised to bomb the crap out of a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  country like Iran if they don't get a deal and then not do it if there's no [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=225.36s)]
*  deal it's not that clear that there's going to be a deal here's rent Yahoo [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=229.12s)]
*  basically giving marching orders to the US we'll see whether or not Trump takes [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  in that way about what he says has to happen before a deal with Iran can be [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  done he said I've just finished my second visit to the US in two months a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=244.56s)]
*  very warm visit with my friend president Donald Trump you could be impressed from [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=253.68s)]
*  the great closeness and friendship between us which was expressed in the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  issues we discussed first of all Iran we agreed that Iran will not have nuclear [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  weapons this can be done by agreement but only if this agreement is Libyan [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  style they go in blow up the installations dismantle all of the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=272.72s)]
*  equipment under American supervision and carried out by America this would be [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=276.48s)]
*  The second possibility that will not be is that they drag out the talks and then [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  there is the military option everyone understands this we spoke about this at [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  Great Lane so Netanyahu came to the US spoke to Trump about the military [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  option against Iran Israel's biggest enemy in the Middle East now Trump's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=296.68s)]
*  argument that look we just can't allow Iran to have nuclear weapons India has [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=303.24s)]
*  nuclear weapons Pakistan has nuclear weapons North Korea has nuclear weapons [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=308.92s)]
*  Israel has nuclear weapons to say nothing of France and the UK and China why is it [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=314.2s)]
*  so uniquely threatening to the US not to Israel but to the US for is Iran to have [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=326.12s)]
*  a nuclear program as well to offset the Israeli one professor Mearsheimer was [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  asked about this this week and he made the point that he thinks nothing would [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=336.48s)]
*  be more stabilizing to the Middle East than if Iran gets nuclear weapons one of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=339.92s)]
*  the things the United States has shown the world is that if you don't have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=344.8s)]
*  nuclear weapons there's a good chance we're going to attack you and bomb you [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  and invade you and blow everything up whenever we want change your government [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=354.56s)]
*  the only protection against that is if you get nuclear weapons then we won't [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=358.76s)]
*  mess with you we don't mess with Pakistan we don't mess with India we [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  don't mess with North Korea we don't mess with China I mean we do a little bit [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=365.28s)]
*  with all this country but we're very constrained because they have nuclear [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=370.28s)]
*  weapons we've created a world in which a country would be crazy not to consider [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  getting nuclear weapons but between Israel and Iran Iran has shown more [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=379.32s)]
*  restraint than Israel we talked about this many times before and in terms of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=384.96s)]
*  their attacks on Israel they were very rational they were very constrained [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=390.52s)]
*  they've never demonstrated that they're a quote suicidal or apocalyptic religious [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=394.28s)]
*  cult I would say Israel is closer to that now than Iran is I agree you don't [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  want Iran to get a nuclear weapon all the things being equal although [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=406.52s)]
*  professor Mearsheimer argues convincingly that it would be good for [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  the Middle East because then the Israelis and the Americans couldn't [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=412.08s)]
*  constantly be threatening to bomb everyone in the Middle East bomb Iran [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=417.76s)]
*  in the Middle East because Iran would be on equal footing to Israel but either [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=420.64s)]
*  way it's much more Israel's problem than the US but Israel problem by definition [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  is the US's problem and Trump says and Netanyahu says this is gonna have to be [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=429.76s)]
*  America that goes in and America that does this and Trump's like yes absolutely [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=434.2s)]
*  even though the whole Trump movement over the last 10 years supposedly has [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=440.36s)]
*  been about getting out of the Middle East getting out of endless wars Trump [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=445.24s)]
*  already has two in the Middle East the bombing of Yemen the one in Gaza now [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=449.72s)]
*  we're talking about a third with a much bigger and more powerful country and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=453.76000000000005s)]
*  military the second issue is this idea of a Libyan model you know what Netanyahu is [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=458.12s)]
*  talking about in 2003 Colonel Gaddafi the Libyan leader agreed to denuclearize [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  to demilitarize the West said look this is what you need to do to become more [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=474.64s)]
*  integrated into the international community and he did and then in the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  next presidency which was Obama's there's no more Gaddafi the US went in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=488.96s)]
*  with the French and the British utterly obliterated Libya got Gaddafi out onto [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=494.8s)]
*  the street where he was raped and murdered and ever since Libya has been [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=502.36s)]
*  ridden with the return of the slave trade with anarchy with ISIS with immense [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=506.88s)]
*  instability that caused an immigration problem for Europe you think anyone's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=512.24s)]
*  gonna be convinced oh yeah do it Gaddafi did look how well it worked out for him [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=517.88s)]
*  you should do that just be militarized then we won't bother you it's the Libyan [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=521.72s)]
*  model says Netanyahu that's the only thing that will work there are some [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=526.96s)]
*  very well connected figures in the MAGA movement meaning well connected to the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=531.9200000000001s)]

*  away from Middle East quagmire's for good we shouldn't throw that opportunity [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=606.52s)]
*  away so that some DC has beens can feel tough by sending young Americans to die [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=610.0s)]
*  yet again couldn't have said that better myself in fact one thing for [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=614.92s)]
*  me or something mentioned when he was on our show last week was that not only is [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  the US stockpile or the US stockpiles being depleted by feeding our Ukraine [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=624.52s)]
*  the weapons they're using to kill Russians and not only are our stockpiles [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=628.8399999999999s)]
*  being depleted because of all military weaponry we've been giving to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel that they've used to destroy civilian life in Gaza but the bombing [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=639.04s)]
*  campaign against Yemen which is very intense but not very successful for a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=643.96s)]
*  lot of reasons we've been bombing Yemen for 20 years and the Houthis have gotten [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=648.0400000000001s)]
*  stronger that's getting very expensive as well it's already up to about a [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=651.1600000000001s)]
*  billion dollars or will be very shortly and it too is worse bombing so much that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  it too is depleting our stockpile so we're depleting our own stockpile for [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=660.6s)]
*  Ukraine for Israel to bomb Yemen and obviously that will thin out American [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=665.92s)]
*  military resources but also it will thin out our resources in general and the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=674.04s)]
*  only reason why Charlie Kirk would go and say something like that is because [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=679.56s)]
*  he's very well connected to the White House and hears what I know other [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=682.36s)]
*  people are hearing which is that at a very high level there is very serious [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=685.64s)]
*  talk about bombing Iran a war with Iran remember Netanyahu does not just want [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=690.24s)]
*  the nuclear installations blown up just like limited bombing he wants regime [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=694.92s)]
*  change in Iran they want to reinstall the Shah of Iran monarchy the son of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=699.68s)]
*  the Shah of Iran remember the whole problem with Iran in the first place [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=705.3199999999999s)]
*  with respect to the United States came because we overthrew their government in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  1954 and we replaced him with the Shah of Iran a US Israeli puppet who was a [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=715.4s)]
*  savage brutal dictator savage and obviously everyone in Iran knows that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=722.12s)]
*  and he lasted for 25 years until the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the reason [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=729.48s)]
*  why that revolution then turned to the US Embassy where they kidnapped our [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=736.04s)]
*  diplomats at the US Embassy which had been there to deal with the Shah is [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=741.32s)]
*  because they knew that their 25 years of dictatorship was backed by and caused by [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=743.92s)]
*  Americans that's why they disliked the United States not because they hate us [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=748.44s)]
*  for our freedom because we all women to walk on the beach with bathing suits but [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=751.28s)]
*  because we interfered in their country we overthrew their government we imposed a [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=754.68s)]
*  tyranny on them for 25 years and now the Netanyahu's of the world and all [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=758.56s)]
*  these other people supporters of Israel throughout the West that guy that that [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=763.36s)]
*  son of the Shah of Iran goes everywhere and Israeli supporters treat him like [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=767.6s)]
*  he's the legitimate ruler of Iran they want to reinstall him they want to do [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=772.12s)]
*  regime change in Iran not just bomb nuclear facilities and this benefits [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=776.16s)]
*  whom as JD Vance argued even the bombing of Yemen has a very little benefit for [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=781.76s)]
*  the US interest we don't have much shipping there it's all for Europe [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=788.76s)]
*  Yemen's not attacking American ships the Houthis are not attacking American [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=793.4s)]
*  ships they're only attacking Israeli ships they stopped the attacks with the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=797.16s)]
*  Gaza ceasefire they resume them only against Israeli ships when is really [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=801.16s)]
*  Israel began blocking the humanitarian aid required by the ceasefire [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=807.8s)]
*  agreement into Gaza this is not our war these are not our interests and yet [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=810.52s)]
*  we're back to fighting and threatening new Middle East Wars for the antithesis [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=816.7199999999999s)]
*  of what America first agenda was supposed to be another person very very [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=821.88s)]
*  well connected in the Trump White House is Tucker Carlson and four days after [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=824.92s)]
*  Charlie Kirk's tweet he posted something very similar even a little more dire he [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=829.96s)]
*  said quote whatever you think of tariffs it's clear now it's the worst possible [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=834.4399999999999s)]
*  time for the United States to participate in a military strike on Iran [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=839.36s)]
*  we can't afford it thousands of Americans would die we lose the war that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=843.24s)]
*  follows nothing would be more destructive to our country and yet we're closer than [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=847.76s)]
*  ever thanks to unwinding unruly pressure from neocons this is suicidal anyone [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=852.08s)]
*  advocating for conflict with Iran is not an ally of the United States but an [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=858.04s)]
*  enemy Tucker wouldn't be sounding that alarm nor would Charlie Kirk unless [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=861.64s)]
*  there was a genuine plan and momentum in the White House to go and do exactly [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=866.52s)]
*  that people mocked him for saying thousands of Americans would die they [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=871.48s)]
*  were like what is Iran gonna invade the United States no these people don't seem [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=873.9599999999999s)]
*  to know that we have military bases all throughout the Middle East in Jordan in [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=879.28s)]
*  Syria and Iraq they've been attacked multiple times by Iran controlled proxies [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=883.5200000000001s)]
*  by Iraqis and American troops have died repeatedly which why are we in Syria why [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=891.48s)]
*  are we in Iraq why are we in Jordan but obviously if we attack Iran those are [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=898.6s)]
*  all very vulnerable targets for Iran we have oil rigs and all kinds of bases [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=903.32s)]
*  throughout the Middle East you think Iran's gonna sit there and take it [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-azFUwQWu8&t=912.68s)]
