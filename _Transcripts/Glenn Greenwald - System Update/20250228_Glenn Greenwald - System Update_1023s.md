# How Does Russia Define Victory in Ukraine?: With Russian Analyst Aleksandr Dugin
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM)
*  Let me ask, let me just go back to Ukraine for a minute because I wanted to, I got sidetracked [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=0.0s)]
*  with some interesting things that I wanted to ask you about anyway. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=10.98s)]
*  But obviously there's a desire on the part of the Trump administration to end the war. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=13.24s)]
*  Trump has said that during the campaign. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=21.48s)]
*  He said that over and over and over again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=23.04s)]
*  He's saying that now as well. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=24.6s)]
*  The question of course is how such a war might end. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=26.72s)]
*  NATO from the beginning defined victory in a way that always seemed to me to be designed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=32.12s)]
*  to ensure their humiliation, which was we want every Russian troop out of every inch [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=37.8s)]
*  of Russia, of what had previously been recognized as Ukraine, including Crimea. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=43.44s)]
*  It seems obvious now that's not going to happen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=49.16s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, the new defense secretary said we're never going to go back to the pre 2014 [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  years. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=56.24s)]
*  There was a lot of anger that he said that, but it seems true. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=57.24s)]
*  There are a lot of people in the West who still think that the motive for the war, the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=61.68s)]
*  goal of Putin, is not only to take all of Ukraine but to exert in a pre-1989 way authority [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=66.4s)]
*  over large parts of Eastern Europe as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=80.36s)]
*  Then there are a lot of people who say no, it seemed like what Putin and the Russians [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=84.12s)]
*  want is some buffer zone to ensure safety between NATO and encroaching NATO moving eastward [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=87.44s)]
*  and Ukraine. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=95.0s)]
*  How do you see the real Russian goal, the longer term Russian goal when it comes to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine and Eastern Europe? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  I think that if we consider the real capacity of Russia, of modern Russia, for example, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=104.6s)]
*  to put Eastern Europe under control, as was the case of the Second World War, we arrive [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=116.24s)]
*  immediately after serious consideration that it is absolutely impossible. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  Maybe it was desirable. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=128.56s)]
*  Maybe we would rave of that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  We would do everything to accomplish that by strategical and historical reasons in order [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=135.6s)]
*  to reinforce our security, but that is absolutely out of our capacities. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  Nobody could say in Russia that we are able to do that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  We will be obliged to put in a situation a necessity to fight with Europe, with NATO, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=159.24s)]
*  and maybe this war will give some positive results, but it is a very, very small possibility. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=166.44s)]
*  People in Russia recognize that, not just you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=175.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=178.52s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=179.52s)]
*  That is common opinion. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=180.52s)]
*  For example, few would say that we would desire that, but all would agree that we are in capability. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  The capability is not there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  More than that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  We may be, it is now very difficult to us to establish full control over Ukraine, and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  we see that, but we would prefer to have at least neutral Ukraine, neutral, not hostile, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=199.08s)]
*  not friendly, but just neutral, as was in the case of Kuchma, Yanukovych, working with [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=210.36s)]
*  the West, having good relations with us, and we would let Ukraine alone with Crimea, with [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=218.28s)]
*  Donbass. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  We didn't want that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=228.24s)]
*  That was our government tried to avoid military intervention. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=230.0s)]
*  That is absolutely clear. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=238.32s)]
*  But we could, when we started more powerful way to keep Ukraine back, our conflicts, there [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=241.76s)]
*  was this war, and in this war, we see some absolutely certain points. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=254.88s)]
*  First of all, NATO, as you have said, could not overcome Russia. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=261.32s)]
*  So, the goal to liberate, so-called liberate Crimea or eastern part of Ukraine is impossible [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=266.32s)]
*  by the, on the level of the powers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=274.92s)]
*  So we stand strong against all the sanctions, all NATO weapons given to Ukrainians, and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=278.24s)]
*  we will stay in that and maybe progress until the end, until the last Russians. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=287.92s)]
*  We are very decisive on that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=296.24s)]
*  But at the same time, we see how difficult to us is to progress. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=297.64s)]
*  So we would satisfy, at least now, with keeping back these territories, assuring that Ukraine [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=303.76s)]
*  is not going to become the part member of NATO. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=313.64s)]
*  When you say keep back, do you mean that, and I realize you're not necessarily negotiating [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=317.44s)]
*  for the government, or even if you were, you wouldn't do it with me. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=321.84s)]
*  But is there a scenario, do you think, in which Russia would be willing to give back [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=324.68s)]
*  to Ukraine some or all of the land it has come to occupy over the last three years? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=332.92s)]
*  It's absolutely zero chance for that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=339.12s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=343.24s)]
*  By, first of all, we have paid big price for that, and nobody in Russia, in Russian society, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=344.36s)]
*  no warriors, no people who have lost their children, their people, their parents, they [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=351.56s)]
*  would accept that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  So Putin has said... [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=361.76000000000005s)]
*  Because otherwise the loss of their children would be for no reason? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=362.76000000000005s)]
*  In other words, it depended on the people who lost their... [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=367.48s)]
*  Because that was the kind of great patriotic war, and it is continuing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=370.6s)]
*  Putin has put his authority on the scale of the victory. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=377.76s)]
*  So without victory, no, no, no, no. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=383.88s)]
*  No legitimacy, historical legitimacy of... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=387.32s)]
*  What is victory? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  That depends, in my opinion, there are different scales. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  So it could be, it could be a control over Ukraine with Putin. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=400.74s)]
*  of Ukraine, putting some not pro-Russian but neutral figure on the top, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=406.8s)]
*  dismantling military potential and Nazi ideology, Russophobia, this hatred to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=414.0s)]
*  Russian Orthodox Church, Russian language. So that would be maximal [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=422.92s)]
*  victory. If we liberate what we call Novorossiya, the territory that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=428.24s)]
*  include four regions we have already have taken and... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  All the provinces in eastern Ukraine that you... [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=441.8s)]
*  As well. So these four provinces and new four provinces around Odessa, Kharkov, Nikolaev and Dnepropetrovsk. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=444.52s)]
*  But that could be annexed to Russia and it could be victory as well. So if we [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=455.8s)]
*  manage to do that or to take Kiev and to divide Ukraine into parts, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=463.48s)]
*  western and eastern. And less possible, the smallest victory that we could [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  maybe afford, I'm not sure, but maybe it is in the plans, it is to keep the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=480.64s)]
*  territories, the provinces we have already in Russia and Crimea, obviously, and to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  give all the Ukraine, all the rest of Ukraine to accept that and to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=495.68s)]
*  demilitarize and promising not to enter NATO. But I think that as well, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  this smallest, smallest victory could provide a huge reaction from the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=511.16s)]
*  population and normal victory, the victory that will immediately satisfy [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=515.52s)]
*  everybody here and that is very important to the future period because we need to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=521.28s)]
*  assimilate, to integrate these new territories, old, in our history, old [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=526.04s)]
*  earths. So that will be accepted by everybody. The smallest, smallest victory [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=532.76s)]
*  that is inconceivable for the West, for Zelensky, I think maybe for Washington [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=540.76s)]
*  now, that could create critical turmoil inside of Russia. So it will be very, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=549.72s)]
*  very, very difficult to present as victory in that level. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=557.64s)]
*  Just maintaining what you have. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=562.76s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=564.36s)]
*  Let me ask you about that because there's a lot of times there is, in western [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=564.72s)]
*  propaganda, a kind of cartoon version of Russia that's presented, which is that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=569.56s)]
*  Putin is not just, as you call him or describe to him, maybe the father figure [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  of the country, but he's a totalitarian leader. Only his will rules everything. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=581.04s)]
*  There's no dissent. There's no opposition. There's no questioning permissible. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=587.0s)]
*  My sense following Russian politics as best as I can from a distance is that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=591.76s)]
*  there's actually been a lot of disagreement in Moscow and in political circles about [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=597.76s)]
*  what this war ought to achieve. You're obviously laying out different views of [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=602.76s)]
*  people have of what it is. Is there a certain kind of political pressure on [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  President Putin inside Russia not to give away too much? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=615.6s)]
*  I think that is not so much political pressure from concrete political groups, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=621.24s)]
*  but rather the general opinion, a kind of moods of people in the front, the people [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=628.64s)]
*  here in the country. So the patriotism is now a kind of common position of the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=636.92s)]
*  absolute majority of the Russians. And patriotism, that is sociological, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=646.72s)]
*  cultural, ideological, psychological, psychological, absolutely. And that creates [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=653.32s)]
*  much more pressure on Putin than any fraction around him. And what is interesting, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=659.44s)]
*  there are people who are in tune with this patriotism and close to Putin, but they are [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=665.96s)]
*  still not the absolute majority. The many representatives of the Putin's elite [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=676.4s)]
*  still believe in the end of the conflicts and restoration of the pre-war relations [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=684.4s)]
*  with the West. So they accepted this patriotic line of Putin and majority of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=690.24s)]
*  the population, but they still have the second thought. And I think they are [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=698.52s)]
*  making the pressure on Putin in order to stop as soon as possible the war. So the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=705.16s)]
*  pressure on Putin is not from the side of the pro-war, towards the goal of Ukraine. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=712.12s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. But from stop it immediately. Stop it in any way and accept any... [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=720.88s)]
*  Who are those people? How would you describe people with those views? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=729.4s)]
*  I'm calling them sixth column. There is fifth column. Fifth column, they are [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=733.84s)]
*  liberals, pro-Western, who openly protest and protest against Putin. Now they are [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=739.6s)]
*  mostly outside of Russia. If they are here, they don't show themselves because [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  it is over with them. So fifth column doesn't exist here as the... [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=756.32s)]
*  Is that because they've been suppressed or imprisoned or just driven out because [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=762.4s)]
*  of public opinion or a combination of both? A combination of both. Not too much [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=767.76s)]
*  repressed, but not too much, and despised by majority of population, but not until [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=771.88s)]
*  the moment to beat them, to heed them, to aggress them. So they preferred to run [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=780.64s)]
*  away before the real repression in their opinion would start. So they have fled [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=788.64s)]
*  the country. So we could not know whether it would be repressions or not, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=798.24s)]
*  severe or not so severe because they are outside. But there is sixth column. So [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=804.44s)]
*  they are liberals, they're representative of this 90s, Yeltsin's time, oligarchs, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=814.16s)]
*  some bureaucrats who really hate patriotism, who hate our people, sovereignty. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=820.36s)]
*  They had very good life during these good relations with the West, and they still [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=830.4399999999999s)]
*  keep the same mood, the same attitude. But instead of... In spite of the rebellion [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=841.32s)]
*  against Putin, they prefer to be on his side. And they... Because they keep their [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  influence that way, but not really share the visions. Six columns. So he are now [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=861.4s)]
*  advocates of Putin, but they dream about stopping the war and return to the pre [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=868.64s)]
*  war period. So that was... I think that is a very interesting situation. They are [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=874.2s)]
*  powerful. They try to influence Putin. They try to make pressure on him, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=880.84s)]
*  and they are part of this globalist network. Maybe they were paid by USAID [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=887.24s)]
*  because now it is manifested that USAID has helped to write Russian constitution. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=892.88s)]
*  We are living under USAID product and many other norms and laws in the beginning [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=903.44s)]
*  of the 90s. So Russia was the part of this network, and the people from this USAID [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=910.24s)]
*  paid network in different levels. Now many of them are the part of people [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=918.76s)]
*  close to... Of our elite, close to Putin. So they weren't purged because Putin [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=924.72s)]
*  is very, very mild, to say the truth, very, very gentle. He prefer to convince [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  someone than to fire or to punish him or her. So he is very, very humanistic, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=938.72s)]
*  and he has conserved almost all the core of this pro-Western liberal elite. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  Only most radical were fired or put outside, but that is the real danger [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=956.0s)]
*  because the mentality of this liberal Six column is much more as Schultz, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=964.48s)]
*  Macron, Stammer, and not Trump. So they want now, they are in a very awkward position. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=971.5999999999999s)]
*  They want peace with the West, but they don't like absolutely Trump because in [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  Trump, they see maybe they fade, they do. If Putin would start something like [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENoISFsZVEM&t=985.3599999999999s)]
