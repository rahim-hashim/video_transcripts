# Biden Authorizes MAJOR ESCALATION With Russia
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg)
*  This war has risked escalation of a very dangerous kind for a long time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=0.0s)]
*  Putin has been constrained, thankfully. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=10.92s)]
*  And now Joe Biden, after his party loses the election, in part because Trump said we have [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=12.64s)]
*  to finish this war in Ukraine and get it resolved, in part because people are sick of endless [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=19.56s)]
*  wars, as a lame duck, as somebody whose party was just vehemently rejected by the American [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=25.12s)]
*  public, makes a decision, or again, when I say Joe Biden, I mean, whoever is acting in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  his name, makes a decision to radically escalate this war on his way out in a way that even [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  the United States previously admitted would be too dangerous to do because it would mean [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  direct U.S.-NATO involvement in the war, where we become direct belligerents against Russia, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=45.84s)]
*  which is by not just giving the Ukrainian long-range missiles, attackums, but authorizing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=51.72s)]
*  their use deep into Russian territory. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=57.64s)]
*  And it isn't just authorizing the Ukrainians to do it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=60.04s)]
*  The Ukrainians cannot operate these missiles on their own. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=63.8s)]
*  They need the satellite and guidance systems of the U.S. or other native countries, and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  that means every missile that's launched, the United States or the Western European [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=72.08s)]
*  militaries will be directly involved in the launching of these missiles to Russia. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=76.72s)]
*  And Putin has said, as a result, we will absolutely regard the first missile that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=80.36s)]
*  lands on our territory to be a direct war with the United States and NATO. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=84.28s)]
*  We will treat it as such. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=88.92s)]
*  And here's the game that Biden is playing from today in The New York Times. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Quote, Biden allows Ukraine to strike Russia with long-range U.S. missiles. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=95.48s)]
*  With two months left in office, the president for the first time authorizes the Ukrainian [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=100.36s)]
*  military to use the system known as attackums to help defend its forces in the Kursk region [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=104.32s)]
*  of Russia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=109.64s)]
*  The weapons are likely to initially be employed against Russian and North Korean troops in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=110.64s)]
*  defense of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of Western Russia, the official said. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=114.36s)]
*  Mr. Biden's decision is a major change of U.S. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=119.0s)]
*  policy. The choice has divided his advisers and the shift comes two months before President [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=121.6s)]
*  Donald J. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=126.92s)]
*  Trump takes office, having vowed to limit further support of Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=127.4s)]
*  The official said that while the Ukrainians were likely to use the missiles first against [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  North Korean troops of threat, Ukrainian forces in Kursk, Mr. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=136.56s)]
*  Biden could authorize them to use the weapons elsewhere, meaning deeper inside Russia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=139.76s)]
*  Some U.S. officials said they feared that Ukraine's use of the missiles across the border [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=144.56s)]
*  could prompt Putin to retaliate with force against the United States and its coalition [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  partners. But other U.S. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  officials said they thought those threats were overblown. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=154.56s)]
*  Now, we don't know what Putin is going to do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=157.2s)]
*  Putin isn't suicidal. He's not stupid, as he's proven repeatedly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=160.32s)]
*  He's not going to pursue a direct military attack on the United States and NATO unless he considers [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=163.44s)]
*  it absolutely necessary. He understands the risk of that very well, especially with a new [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=167.92s)]
*  president, Donald Trump, coming into power in just two months, who has promised repeatedly and won [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=172.24s)]
*  on a campaign pledge of ending the war, not escalating it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=179.28s)]
*  Still, this decision by Biden is so reckless. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=184.32s)]
*  It's so politically unethical. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  On your way out, as an 81-year-old man who doesn't really care that much about the future, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  you just say, ah, screw it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=197.84s)]
*  Let the Ukrainians bomb deep inside Russia in a way that we or our European allies have to help [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=200.24s)]
*  them do it, knowing that Putin has said that this is a direct attack on Russia. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=206.56s)]
*  And remember, this is all being done to help the Ukrainian forces that have invaded Russia and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=213.6s)]
*  occupy an increasingly smaller part of their land. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=218.4s)]
*  And what really is going on here is that it is now inevitable that NATO and the US will be [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=223.6s)]
*  humiliated. From the start, they defined victory in a way that could never be accomplished, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=229.04s)]
*  namely driving out all Russian troops out of every inch of Ukrainian soil. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=236.4s)]
*  There is zero chance that that will happen. Nobody believes that will happen. Everyone knows that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=241.92s)]
*  won't happen. NATO and Biden said, we will fight until the end to ensure victory against Russia. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=245.68s)]
*  We will not let Russia win. Russia has won the war. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=253.12s)]
*  This is all about trying to save face and get a better deal from the Russians, who inevitably [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=257.6s)]
*  are going to occupy part of Ukraine. But it's also, it's really about this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=264.56s)]
*  I really believe it's about this, which is Trump has vowed and promised to do what should be done, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=268.72s)]
*  something Tulsi Gabbard favors, a lot of Republicans favor, which is not escalating that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=278.08s)]
*  war further, not funding it further, not arming it further, but instead negotiating a deal with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=286.24s)]
*  Russia, which of course will involve Russian control over Ukrainian land. They've paid a huge [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=290.08s)]
*  price to get that. They're not giving that up. And when that happens, there's going to be an [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=296.24s)]
*  effort on the part of the media and the Democratic Party to say, look, Trump gave away Ukraine, parts [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  of Ukraine to his friend Vladimir Putin. When in reality, we're on that road anyway, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  European capitals, American officials, even Ukrainian officials understand that this war [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  has to end. It's far too destructive and there's no chance of achieving victory. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=321.2s)]
*  But they're going to get to fabricate this narrative that it was Trump who gave away parts [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=326.64s)]
*  of Ukraine, when in reality, it was the Biden administration and NATO officials who wanted this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=330.32s)]
*  war, who could have averted it early on with a buffer zone and promise of neutrality, no joining [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=336.48s)]
*  of NATO, and instead purposely averted a diplomatic solution, caused this war to kill [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=342.32s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of young men, both in Russia and Ukraine. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=350.4s)]
*  And now ensure that the Russians are never going to give up territory that they paid such a steep [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=354.56s)]
*  price in order to get. It's not going to be Trump's fault. It's going to be the fault of Biden. Now, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=360.64s)]
*  here's the economist offering a very important piece of analysis earlier today about this decision [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=365.44s)]
*  by Biden. And what they're essentially saying is this was something that Biden and his advisors [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=372.32s)]
*  were adamant against doing from the beginning of the war. There was pressure from the Europeans. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=377.44s)]
*  Keir Starmer, the prime minister of Great Britain, flew to Washington to try and badger Biden into [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=384.4s)]
*  allowing and authorizing the involvement of NATO this way. And Biden was steadfast that that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=389.84s)]
*  wouldn't happen. And the reason why the US wouldn't do it is because of how serious the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=395.28s)]
*  risk of escalation are from doing this. Here's what the economists were called. The headline is [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=400.32s)]
*  Ukraine cannot last use its American missiles inside Russia. They're talking about the reasons [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=407.12s)]
*  why the US has refused to allow these attack missiles to be used until now. Quote, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=411.68s)]
*  the third reason is the risk of escalation. Ukraine has frequently used its own drones and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=417.36s)]
*  missiles to strike inside Russia. One attack in September took out three to four months worth of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=422.48s)]
*  ammunition. But a tacum strike typically require American assistance with intelligence and targeting [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=428.88s)]
*  direct American involvement. Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, has as a result said that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=436.64s)]
*  use of Western missiles in Russia would constitute, quote, direct involvement in the war, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=441.44s)]
*  which of course it would. Here was Putin back in September of 2024, as reported by Bloomberg, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=447.6s)]
*  talking about how Russia would viewed any decision of this kind. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=454.8s)]
*  The US is not in a position to do this. If this decision is made, it would mean nothing [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=465.68s)]
*  but direct involvement of NATO countries, the US, European countries in the war against Ukraine. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=472.48s)]
*  This is their direct involvement. And this would change the nature of the conflict. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=482.24s)]
*  Who can argue with that? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=490.72s)]
*  The fact that if the United States sends its military officials, its soldiers, its intelligence [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=508.72s)]
*  officials, to work directly with Ukraine on launching American-made, American-sent, American-sold [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=515.28s)]
*  missiles into Russia because Ukraine can't do it on its own, that of course the United States would [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=521.92s)]
*  now be a direct participant, a direct belligerent in attacking Russia. Why risk that? Why risk that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=527.6s)]
*  kind of retaliation, that risk of nuclear war from an 81-year-old man who doesn't know where he is, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=533.52s)]
*  whose party has just been soundly rejected and who's on his way out of the presidency in the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=539.28s)]
*  lame duck to make a decision of that consequence, of that danger, is insane. Back in September, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=544.8s)]
*  the New York Times published an op-ed with the title, Ukraine is running out of optimists. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=552.4s)]
*  And it essentially talked about how even the hardest-core boosters of the war are now admitting [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  that this war has destroyed them, that they have no chance of winning. They're wanting this war to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  end. All it's doing is killing them and destroying their country, and they know they've accepted [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=573.44s)]
*  that they cannot beat Russia, that eventually the Russians will control, as they do now, a good [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=579.44s)]
*  chunk of Ukraine. They're controlling about 24 percent of the country, and every day Russia [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=586.0s)]
*  expands further, a mile, a half mile, two miles further westward into Ukraine, headed toward Kiev. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=590.48s)]
*  And obviously the Ukrainians want to stop that. They want to stop the Russians where they are, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=600.48s)]
*  not allow them to get more territory, get the security guarantees that they need, and stop the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=605.6s)]
*  killing and dying of their citizens. Even in Ukraine, they realize this, and Joe Biden instead [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=610.0s)]
*  is saying, oh, let's just keep pouring fuel on the fire. This is a big reason the Democratic Party [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=615.76s)]
*  lost, because of the perception that the United States wants to spend its money on everything [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=621.84s)]
*  other than the welfare of American citizens. You go and look at all these exit discussions and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  exit polls about the anger. People have anger about their perception, we're spending a lot of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=634.64s)]
*  money to give benefits to people who enter the country illegally that citizens don't have, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=641.12s)]
*  but they're also very angry about the hundreds of billions of dollars going out the door to help [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=645.92s)]
*  Ukraine, to help Israel, and when people can't afford groceries or basic health care for their [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=651.52s)]
*  kids, of course that's going to make them angry. And it also is just a series of endless wars. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=658.24s)]
*  And obviously Americans don't wake up and care about who's going to rule various provinces in [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  eastern Ukraine. Why is the United States involved in that war? Again, Tulsi Gabbard questioned that, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKUfssnwdqg&t=670.96s)]
