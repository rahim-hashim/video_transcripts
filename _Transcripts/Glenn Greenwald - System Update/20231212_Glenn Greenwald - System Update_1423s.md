# Censoring Israel Critics (& Right-Wing Hypocrisy) Is Nothing New
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ)
*  But this entire time, all these years, that left liberals have been building the censorship [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  regime aimed at conservative voices, it has also been a very common and pervasive form [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=13.44s)]
*  of censorship in the United States to censor Israel critics in academia, in media, in politics, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  in corporate America. They've lost their jobs, they've been fired, they've been banned, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=27.86s)]
*  they've been punished. This is not some new thing that the American right is suddenly [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  doing against the left as tit for tat, oh, we're finally going to show them what it's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=37.46s)]
*  like to be censored. This is something that's been going on for a long time. I'm suppressing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=43.06s)]
*  a sneeze, so we'll see if I'm able to succeed in doing that. I don't know what you do when [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  have to sneeze and you're live on the air. I think I've vanquished it for the moment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=53.059999999999995s)]
*  In any event, here is just to, I want to just give you a sense for what's going on, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=59.3s)]
*  for the real historical framework for what's going on. So at the very beginning of 2023, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=65.78s)]
*  obviously way before the Hamas attack on October 7th, talking about January of 2023, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  we devoted an entire show to the question of whether the American right has an Israel [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=79.62s)]
*  exception when it comes to their belief in free speech. There you see the graphic that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=87.46s)]
*  we use, thou shall not criticize Israel. You see in the background the ADL and Harvard, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=95.22s)]
*  because back then there were attempts to claim that Harvard was allowing too much anti-Israel [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=100.82s)]
*  speech. This is not new. And you see a picture of Benjamin Netanyahu and our title, the title [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=105.46s)]
*  that we gave to our program was the right's identity politics, exploiting anti-Semitism [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  to suppress debate and defame political opponents. And it was all about how the American right loves [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=120.41999999999999s)]
*  to believe that their opponents of identity politics, they hate how they're not going to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=127.38s)]
*  they hate how the left always accuses everybody their enemies of being racist and bigot as a way [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=134.82s)]
*  of censoring and suppressing debate and ruining people's reputations and also limiting the range [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=140.02s)]
*  of political views. Oh no, you can't say that that's fascism. We're not suppressing free speech, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=146.34s)]
*  we're just fighting fascism and white nationalism and racism. And we devoted this whole show to how [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=150.34s)]
*  it is very common on some, in some sectors of the American right to do exactly that when it comes to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=155.86s)]
*  criticism of Israel, to run around accusing everybody of being anti-Semite, a racist in other [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=162.5s)]
*  words, to demand that any events at college campuses or students or professors who are [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=169.22s)]
*  anti-Israel be silenced, be barred, that events be canceled, that professors be fired. All the things [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=177.22s)]
*  that the American right has claimed it hates when the left liberals do, many people on the right [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=186.02s)]
*  particularly the pro-Israel right have been doing this not recently but for many many years now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=192.18s)]
*  This is not a new thing that's being done just to give the American left the sense for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=198.66s)]
*  what they've been doing. This has been going on forever in the United States. Here is a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=204.02s)]
*  op-ed in the Washington Post that I found very important. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=213.3s)]
*  And you can put the headline on the screen. It's by Claire Finkelstein and she is an academic at a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=215.78s)]
*  university and unlike many people on the right who are cheering censorship while pretending they're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=221.62s)]
*  not, she admits this is the real game here. There you see the amazing headline, to fight anti-Semitism [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=227.7s)]
*  on campuses we must restrict speech. This is what people are cheering who are pressuring [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=237.38s)]
*  university professors to crack down on anti-Israel speech. And yes I know all the arguments that oh [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=246.34s)]
*  this speech is genocide, that's the reason why it has to be suppressed but as we've shown before [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=256.1s)]
*  it is a fiction that there are huge numbers of students on college campuses running around [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=263.54s)]
*  chanting gas the Jews or kill all Jews or genocide the Jews. The United States has been engaged in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=268.58000000000004s)]
*  the debate over the last two weeks, a hysterical debate where a manufacturer crisis has been [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=275.14000000000004s)]
*  disseminated to justify censorship that there's all these students on college campuses going around [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  chanting gas the Jews and genocide. This is not happening. And yet the United States is [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=285.22s)]
*  I've asked over a hundred people in the last week to please just give me any examples of American [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=293.62s)]
*  students or students on American campuses chanting gas the Jews or kill the Jews [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=299.22s)]
*  and it isn't happening. The key left-wing tactic for censorship, the left liberal tactic, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=304.1s)]
*  is to take right-wing speech and say this speech is not within the bounds of decency. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  It's not real political speech, it's fascism, it's white nationalism, it's racism, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=319.54s)]
*  it's transphobic and that when conservatives say their little slogans about race or [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  LGBTs or immigrants what they really mean is kill all black people, kill all [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=335.06s)]
*  trans people, kill all immigrants and that's what we're censoring. Violent speech, that's the left [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=341.86s)]
*  wing tactic to take right-wing speech, re-characterize it as fascist white nationalist [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=347.06s)]
*  genuinely about trying to provoke violence against minority groups and only then saying [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=352.82s)]
*  well now we have to censor it. This is exactly the tactic being used to justify censorship of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=357.14s)]
*  Israel speech. I hear it every day now. Oh no this isn't really criticism of Israel, this is advocacy [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=363.78s)]
*  of genocide and it's done by taking very standard pro-Palestinian views like calling for Intifada [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=370.42s)]
*  which is the Arabic word for uprising or from the river to the sea which means all Palestinians in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=380.98s)]
*  Israel, the West Bank and Gaza should be free and yes it can have a violent connotation just like [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=388.66s)]
*  opposition to immigration might be motivated by white nationalism but it doesn't mean it always is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=396.18s)]
*  and even if it were a call for violence against Israel that is clearly protected speech you're [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=403.3s)]
*  allowed to say bomb Iran, you're allowed to say bomb Gaza, you're allowed to say use violence [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  against Israel, these are allowed. We don't have an Israel exception to the first amendment [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=412.74s)]
*  but this finally is an op-ed that is being honest about what it's actually calling for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=418.26000000000005s)]
*  in demanding that anti-Semitism on campuses be curbed. It's a curb on free speech. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=423.06s)]
*  That is what this op-ed is advocating quote we must restrict speech and here's the argument [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  quote this is because the value of free speech has been elevated to a near sacred level on [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=436.66s)]
*  university campuses that's considered bad. What is this person arguing against? That the value of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=442.02s)]
*  free speech has been elevated to near sacred level on campuses is what we have to fight against [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=449.29999999999995s)]
*  because they say quote as a result universities have had to tolerate hate speech [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  even hate speech calling for violence against ethnic or religious minorities [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=462.97999999999996s)]
*  with the dramatic rise in anti-Semitism we are discovering that this is a mistake meaning [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=467.78s)]
*  elevating free speech. Anti-Semitism and other forms of hate cannot be fought on university [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=473.78s)]
*  campuses without restricting poisonous speech that targets Jews and other minorities. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=480.73999999999995s)]
*  This is what this cause that so many conservatives are supporting is now about. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=487.29999999999995s)]
*  It is right here anti-Semitism [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=494.82s)]
*  and other forms of hate by which she means racism transphobia xenophobia [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=499.06s)]
*  cannot be fought on university campuses without restricting speech. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=507.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you see how people who think they're doing this tit for tat against leftist or liberals [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=514.34s)]
*  are really just strengthening these people who want to censor the aesthetic of the system [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=521.86s)]
*  the establishment in the United States is pro-Israel you're not getting back at the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  establishment they're happy to censor Israel critics because they're so pro-Israel these are [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=531.46s)]
*  the people on campuses who are getting strengthened by these conservative calls for [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=536.74s)]
*  restrictions on speech on campus. She goes on quote with or without the first amendment calls [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=542.1s)]
*  for genocide against Jews or even proxies for such sentiments such proxies for such sentiments [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=547.5400000000001s)]
*  such as calling for intifada or the elimination of Israel by jumping from the river to the sea [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=555.7s)]
*  are in the present context calls for a violence against a discrete ethnic or religious group [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=560.0200000000001s)]
*  such speech speech arguably incites violence frequently inspires harassment of Jewish students [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=566.26s)]
*  and without question creates a hostile environment that can impair the equal opportunity of Jewish [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=571.94s)]
*  students. Do you do you see that is the left liberal censorship case verbatim just replace [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=576.4200000000001s)]
*  Jewish students with black students or trans students or Latinos or gay students [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=583.06s)]
*  or Muslim students and you have the censorship regime that has been created what they're trying [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=588.66s)]
*  to do is now to say just let we were happy to include Jews in that that way we can censor even more. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=593.38s)]
*  This is Claire Finkelstein a tenured professor of law and philosophy at the University of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=600.9799999999999s)]
*  Pennsylvania where all these controversies are taking place. She's unbelievably a member of the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=604.8199999999999s)]
*  school's open expression committee and chair of the law school's committee on academic freedom [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=610.5s)]
*  and she's just saying outright we're taking these conservative calls [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=617.78s)]
*  to use it as an opportunity to impose even more censorship. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=621.22s)]
*  Now as I said none of this is new left-wing Palestinian defenders have been among the most [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=627.3s)]
*  censored people in the United States for many years along with conservative speakers. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=634.58s)]
*  Here is the Guardian back in 2007. It's talking about 15 years ago now 16 years ago. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=640.5s)]
*  University denies tenure to outspoken Holocaust academic. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=650.74s)]
*  This is about Norman Finkelstein. What had happened was Norman Finkelstein was teaching [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=655.62s)]
*  at DePaul University. He was a very well-known scholar. He had written scholarly books [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=659.3s)]
*  obviously very critical of Israel and Jewish activist groups like Holocaust groups that he [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=665.9399999999999s)]
*  said were exploiting the Holocaust to prevent criticism of Israel. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=672.74s)]
*  But his scholarship was well regarded. He had the approval of his tenure committee [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=678.1s)]
*  and Alan Dershowitz the fanatical Israel supporter went on a crusade [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=683.86s)]
*  to get tenure denied to Norman Finkelstein because he is a outspoken critic of Israel [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=688.34s)]
*  and Dershowitz won. Finkelstein got his tenure denied and he's really taught at any school since. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  One of the most rancorous disputes in American academic academia has ended with a prominent [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=703.78s)]
*  political scientist with controversial views on Israel and anti-Semitism being denied tenure at [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=709.06s)]
*  one of the country's largest universities. Does this sound like it's new? A political scientist [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=715.4599999999999s)]
*  with controversial views on Israel being denied tenure at one of the largest universities? This [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=722.0999999999999s)]
*  is not tit for tat what is being done now. This is just a repetition of what's been going on in [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=727.06s)]
*  the United States for many years when it comes to criticism to punishment and censorship of Israel [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=731.62s)]
*  critics. Norman Finkelstein author of the Holocaust Industry Named the Holocaust [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=738.26s)]

*  in this case, barely anyone in the American right defended Professor Salacia because they [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=916.98s)]

*  this and CNN fired her overnight. Helen Thomas for those of you who may not remember was one of the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=962.3399999999999s)]
*  most famous and accomplished White House journalists in the country. She was the first woman to cover [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=972.66s)]
*  the White House in the 60s. She was a mainstay at every press conference going back to JFK and [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=978.42s)]
*  LBJ and Nixon and Ford and Reagan and I mean just she was an institution and she had Palestinian [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=988.42s)]
*  descent and in 2010 she said that she was fired, here you see, White House columnist Helen Thomas [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=997.46s)]
*  resigns after telling Jews quote go home. Now she wasn't telling Jews in America to go home, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1011.46s)]
*  she was telling Jews in Israel to go home. Helen Thomas, a veteran columnist for Hearst newspapers, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1016.26s)]
*  announced her resignation today shortly after the White House condemned her remarks about Jews [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1021.14s)]
*  as quote offensive and reprehensible, that's the Obama White House. Thomas caused an uproar [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1026.26s)]
*  with a recent remark that Jews should quote get the hell out of Palestine and go home to Poland, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1032.9s)]
*  Germany, America and anywhere else. She was like 90 at the time by the way. I think she should and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1037.22s)]
*  has apologized, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in the Delhi briefing today. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1043.22s)]
*  Obviously those remarks do not reflect certainly the opinion of I assume most of the people in here [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1047.94s)]
*  and certainly not of the Obama administration. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1052.5s)]
*  Just case after case after case after case after case after case of people being fired [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1057.3s)]
*  in academia and media for criticizing Israel for angering pro-Israel factions in the United States. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1062.18s)]
*  Again, support of that if you want, try and find ways for some reason why this kind of cancel culture [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1068.9s)]
*  while this kind of censorship is permissible. Please don't tell me that the spate of censorship [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1075.14s)]
*  and cancellation since October 7th is something new in this country that the American right is [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1081.94s)]
*  only cheering to finally show the American left what it's like because this has been going on a [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1087.06s)]
*  long long time. In 2015, the Senate for Constitutional Rights prepared a report [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1092.26s)]
*  that was entitled the Palestine exception to free speech, a movement under attack in the United States. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1098.8200000000002s)]
*  And I use this report a lot in my reporting and it concluded the following quote, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1105.7s)]
*  this report released by the Senate for Constitutional Rights and Palestine Legal in September 2015 [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1110.5s)]
*  documents for the first time the widespread and growing suppression of Palestinian human rights [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1115.8600000000001s)]
*  advocacy in the United States. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1126.18s)]
*  Between January 2014 and June 2015, Palestine Legal responded to nearly 300 incidents of suppression. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1127.86s)]
*  85% of those incidents targeted students and professors on a total of more than 65 U.S. college [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1135.3s)]
*  campuses. This trend has significant implications for both the First Amendment and democratic [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1142.26s)]
*  principles like academic freedom not to mention the mission of higher education to help develop [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1147.2199999999998s)]
*  critical thinking. The first amendment was a major step in the history of the United States [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1152.82s)]
*  of America's democratic and democratic politics. This was a major step in the history of the United [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1157.78s)]
*  States of America and the United States of America's democratic and democratic politics. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1163.54s)]
*  This report outlines the tactics including event cancellations, baseless legal complaints, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1170.1s)]
*  administrative disciplinary actions, firing and false and inflammatory accusations of terrorism [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1175.1399999999999s)]
*  and anti-Semitism that Israel advocacy organizations, universities, government actors, and other [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1180.18s)]
*  organizations have been able to use to support the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1186.02s)]
*  United States of America. This report is an index more than 50 campus related case studies. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  In 2018, here is from NBC News, Mark Lamont Hill was fired from CNN after he gave a speech criticizing Israel [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1192.8999999999999s)]
*  and he had to say I don't support anti-Semitism, I don't support killing Jewish people, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1201.62s)]
*  I simply support the movement for Palestinian rights but he was fired by CNN. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1206.34s)]
*  Now you would be very hard pressed by the way to find any similar examples of pro-Israel advocates being [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1215.86s)]
*  fired from their jobs. Just like since October 7th almost every person fired for speaking about the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1224.1799999999998s)]
*  Israel-Gaza war or who was canceled or had events canceled by institutions under pressure from big [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1231.3s)]
*  donors, it's almost all entirely in one direction. The people being silenced and fired and canceled [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1237.86s)]
*  are pro-Palestinian advocates, people who criticize the Israeli government and its actions in Gaza, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1245.62s)]
*  almost none defending Israel. The only example I know and there may be a couple others but it's so [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1252.34s)]
*  lopsided is a UCLA professor who confronted pro-Palestinian students who are protesting [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1259.9399999999998s)]
*  in defense of Palestine and said something like kill them all, kill all Hamas and I think he was [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1266.58s)]
*  placed on leave or suspended pending an investigation and I denounce that as repressive [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1272.66s)]
*  because I'm not a free speech hypocrite, I actually believe in free speech, I don't only say that when [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1279.6200000000001s)]
*  it's views that I agree with that are being targeted but overwhelmingly it's been pro-Palestinian [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1285.14s)]
*  advocates who are being centered and silenced and that's not new that's been going on for more than [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1292.8200000000002s)]
*  a couple decades in the United States. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1297.1399999999999s)]
*  As we all know Ben Shapiro is a fanatical defender of free speech, he loves free speech so much he [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1300.98s)]
*  cannot abide censorship. When Marklemont Hill was fired by CNN for his criticisms of Israel, Ben [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1306.26s)]
*  Shapiro went on to daily wire shortly thereafter and he defended CNN, Ben Shapiro did. Why CNN's [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1314.4199999999998s)]
*  firing of Marklemont Hill was right. Can you believe it? Ben Shapiro, his defense of free [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1323.46s)]
*  speech ends at criticism of Israel just like his opposition to affirmative action ends at setting [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1331.46s)]
*  aside jobs for Jews. It is incredibly easy to cut off all empathy for other minority groups of which [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1336.74s)]
*  are not a part. Oh those little black people are whining about feeling oppressed on college [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1345.78s)]
*  campuses, oh those trans people are whining about feeling unsafe because of someone from our [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1351.14s)]
*  network saying I believe in the eradication of transgenderism from society, those poor little [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1358.0200000000002s)]
*  babies they need to toughen up, do they need a little therapy dog or a safe space or a blanket? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1362.8200000000002s)]
*  So easy to mock the grievances of other groups to which you don't belong. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1371.8600000000001s)]
*  Now when it's your group that's suddenly saying oh no we feel unsafe, we feel besieged by this speech. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1375.3s)]
*  Then you turn around and say oh yeah CNN good job for getting rid of that Israel critic, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn25DBGktgQ&t=1382.8999999999999s)]
