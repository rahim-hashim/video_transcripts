# ENTREVISTA: Roger Waters Fala sobre MÃºsica, Carreira, PolÃ­tica, Guerras, e Mais ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM)
*  Good evening, it's Wednesday, November 1st. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a new episode of System Update, our live daily show that airs every Monday [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=17.0s)]
*  through Friday at 7 p.m. Eastern, exclusively here on Rumble, the free speech alternative [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=20.92s)]
*  to YouTube. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=25.92s)]
*  The musician Roger Waters really doesn't need much of an introduction. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=27.840000000000003s)]
*  His band Pink Floyd is one of the most successful and influential in the history of all of rock [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  music. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  Albums like The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall have become among the best selling [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  and most well known albums in the last six or seven decades. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  But Waters is often at least as well known these days, if not more so for the political [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  stances he takes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=51.92s)]
*  In recent weeks, he has certainly become an extremely controversial figure, especially [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=52.92s)]
*  over the last couple of years, as he has been an outspoken voice against the U.S. and NATO [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=56.56s)]
*  war in Ukraine and a constant critic of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=61.88s)]
*  occupation of Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=66.8s)]
*  He has become someone who has been widely vilified in Western media circles and in establishment [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=68.44s)]
*  institutions of media as being an extremist, as being an anti-Semite, essentially every [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=74.26s)]
*  term that could be cast at him, including pro-Russian and pro-Kremlin, have been applied [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  to him as a means to discredit him. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=85.56s)]
*  He is currently here in Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro, where he is performing as part of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  his global tour. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  He started off in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia and then he came to Rio de Janeiro [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=94.9s)]
*  today for a show on Saturday night and we were able to sit down with him here in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  for a fascinating and often contemplative and widespread discussion about many different [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=104.56s)]
*  issues, both political and personal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=110.84s)]
*  He came to Rio de Janeiro in 2018 as part of his tour back then and I was able, along [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=113.12s)]
*  with my husband David Miranda, to spend a fair amount of time with him during the entire [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=118.92s)]
*  week that he was in Rio and got to see a side of him that I think most people don't see, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=122.76s)]
*  especially those who are subject to the vilification campaign. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=127.16s)]
*  It really, I think, shed light for me on how to think about, understand, and process the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=130.2s)]
*  views of Roger Waters and I wanted to sit down with him so that those of you who watch [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=136.6s)]
*  the show could hear the same sort of perspective, the same kind of reasoning and where his views [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  are coming from that I heard. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=147.48s)]
*  We spent some amount of time talking about things that you would expect us to talk about, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  like the Israeli war in Gaza and the role of the US in the West in supporting it, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=153.16s)]
*  ongoing war in Ukraine, a little bit about the war in Syria, but a lot of it too was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=157.72s)]
*  about his musical career, the reason why he has decided to enter these very choppy and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=161.88s)]
*  controversial political waters, what is it about him that compelled him to do so even [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  though it has resulted in a lot of difficulties for him in career loss, including the loss [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=175.08s)]
*  of a contract with his music company, criminal investigations in Germany that tried to claim [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=179.68s)]
*  that his performance of The Wall, which was always a satire of tyrannical despots, was [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=185.28s)]
*  somehow a glorification of Nazism, only for that to spread, including into Brazil where [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=190.72s)]
*  the Brazilian government warned him that if he came here and tried to perform The Wall [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=195.76s)]
*  with that uniform, he could run afoul of Brazilian law and would have federal police agents at [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  his shows making sure that he was in compliance. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=205.88s)]
*  The Brazilian government backed off of that, but he has been a person who has been kind [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=208.83999999999997s)]
*  of a lightning rod on a variety of issues that we cover here on our show, including [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=213.44s)]
*  free debate and the weaponization of anti-Semitism and what happens to you when you oppose American [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=217.3s)]
*  wars and Western foreign policy, and I really kind of did not expect the interview to go [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=222.88s)]
*  the way that it did. He was very reflective, very contemplative in a very honest way, oftentimes [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=227.24s)]
*  emotional, and it was an interview that I really enjoyed conducting, I really enjoyed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=232.72s)]
*  listening to it, and I think you'll really enjoy the interview as well. We're excited [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=238.72s)]
*  to show you my discussion in Rio de Janeiro with Roger Waters. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  Roger, welcome back to Rio de Janeiro, and it's great to see you. I'm so happy you took [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=261.0s)]
*  the time to talk to us today. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=264.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. I'm happy to be here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=266.68s)]
*  You're in Rio because it's part of a global tour for your show, and I've seen in interviews [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=269.64s)]
*  you playfully referring to this as your first farewell tour, I guess kind of slightly mocking [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=275.92s)]
*  musicians who say, this is my last tour, and then they never seem to go away. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=281.26s)]
*  Well spotted. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=285.76s)]
*  What's that? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=286.76s)]
*  Well spotted. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=287.76s)]
*  So I'm just wondering though, do you have any sense that you're kind of thinking about [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=288.76s)]
*  stopping at least these intense global tours, or are you going to keep going for as long [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=296.72s)]
*  as you like it and as long as you can? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=300.04s)]
*  I probably will stop it fairly soon. Whether this will be the very last one, I don't know. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  I've only done one show in South America so far, which was Brasilia a few days ago, and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  it does take more energy to pay to 40,000 people or 60,000 people than it does in a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  15 or 16,000 seat arena, unquestionably. But I try to stay fit, touch wood, I'm reasonably [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=324.0s)]
*  fit. I only had COVID once in Europe during that. We did 43 dates, I think, or 40 in Europe. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=335.48s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=346.6s)]
*  Well, the last time you were here was 2018, and my husband, David Moran, and I were able [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  to spend a fair amount of time with you. And one of the things I remember both of us talking [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  about was kind of marveling at how much energy it takes, not only due to the show, we saw [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  that show. And you know, it's like intense physical work on top of the music. But one [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  of the things we saw was that you're not someone who just gets to a city and stays in your [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  hotel. You were seeing a lot of communities, a lot of meeting with a lot of political activists, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=371.04s)]
*  with kids. So you're, at least from what I could tell you, somebody who comes to a place [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=376.32s)]
*  and gets to learn it, what have as much as you can, what are your impressions of Brazil [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=381.76s)]
*  as a country, Rio de Janeiro as a city? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=385.84s)]
*  The thing I was thinking, oh, by the way, I met Lula. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=388.76s)]
*  Oh, you did? Well, on this trip? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=392.92s)]
*  In Brasilia, yeah, the day before the show. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=394.84s)]
*  Because the last time you were here, he was in prison, I believe, about to go to prison, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  already in prison. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=400.32s)]
*  I tried to go to prison, and they wouldn't let me, honestly. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=401.32s)]
*  They were very keen on the idea of locking me up in Curitiba. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=406.12s)]
*  Yes, they were. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=409.48s)]
*  Because I think it was the day before the presidential election, and they said, if you [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=410.48s)]
*  say anything political after 10 o'clock, you're going to prison. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=415.36s)]
*  So we both... [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=421.6s)]
*  That was on, that was on, before this trip, or before the last one. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=422.6s)]
*  That was 2018. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=426.32s)]
*  Right, uh-huh. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=427.32s)]
*  So I was a bit sneaky. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=428.88s)]
*  I went, all right, at 9.55, wherever we are in the show, you stop the tape, we stop, and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=431.48s)]
*  I'm going to do a political bit, and we're going to do it for four and a half minutes, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=441.12s)]
*  and then we're going to start the show. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=444.84s)]
*  I remember that, that you did that exact thing in Rio, like, really observing the 10 o'clock, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=445.84s)]
*  cut off while mocking it at the same time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  How was the meeting with Lula? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=453.24s)]
*  Fabulous, you know. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  We got on like a house on fire, as you would sort of expect. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=456.12s)]
*  We're roughly the same age, and we have fairly similar politics. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=459.6s)]
*  And I did follow the whole thing, you know, with that, the previous election here, with [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=465.88s)]
*  that Bolsonaro one, and so I followed the weird political polarization in this country, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=470.32s)]
*  where that's so close. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=478.36s)]
*  The election that Lula won, in 22, I suppose. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=480.56s)]
*  2022, yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=483.52s)]
*  It was like, just barely by, not even two points. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=484.68s)]
*  Yeah, like 1% or something. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=486.88s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's very interesting to me, because this is almost could be a global phenomenon. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  And you know, it's what you get when people are in desperate straits, I think, is you [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  get polarization, because everybody is so uncomfortable. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=503.4s)]
*  Don't get me started on neoliberal, Milton Friedman, Chicago boys capitalism. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=509.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the things Bolsonaro brought in, is this kind of hardcore austerity. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=517.0s)]
*  I mean, I've definitely been a critic of Lula's domestic politics. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people have, but on the foreign stage, I think he's one of the most important voices, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  because he's steadfastly independent of the United States. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=528.08s)]
*  He insists on this kind of neutral peacemaking role, both in Ukraine and now in this new war. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=530.76s)]
*  But let me ask you, one of the things I saw, I saw a video of your show in Brasilia, the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=536.48s)]
*  first one you did, and at the beginning, you addressed the people that you describe as [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=541.4000000000001s)]
*  those who say, oh, I love Pink Floyd's music so much, but I can't stand Roger's politics. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=545.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=550.0s)]
*  And the message you sent had to them was basically, oh, go fuck off to the bar. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=551.0s)]
*  And when I heard that, I thought, oh, that's basically just being very defiant and sticking [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=555.84s)]
*  your middle finger up at those people. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=561.12s)]
*  But then I also know that you have this new song, The Bar, that is about dialogue and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=562.96s)]
*  trying to foster free debate and the like. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=569.2s)]
*  So what is that message that you intended to convey with that? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, if you actually listen, because it's a recording of me speaking to the announcement, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=576.64s)]
*  it's the same recording that when we're on the road here, it's quite clear from the tone [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=582.2s)]
*  of my voice that it's a joke. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not actually telling people to go and sit in a bar if they don't agree with my politics. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  And obviously, audiences all over North America and all over Europe, they get it completely [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=597.4s)]
*  and they all roar, either with laughter or with appreciation or with something. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=602.3599999999999s)]
*  So I have succeeded in that it is a good piece of theatre to do that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=607.4s)]
*  I'm sad to say that the... [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=614.3599999999999s)]
*  We have it translated in Portuguese and Spanish. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=616.32s)]
*  I don't know why both languages here in Brazil. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=619.12s)]
*  And they haven't translated, fuck off. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=623.5200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=626.6s)]
*  It's just said, like, kind of, remove yourself. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=627.6s)]
*  Yeah, retire, remove yourself. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=629.6s)]
*  I noticed that as well. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=631.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I only just noticed it and said, what the fuck's that? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  Retire cannot be fuck off. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=637.7600000000001s)]
*  Because it's not how you express yourself. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=639.88s)]
*  It's very British, like, oh, kindly retire to the bar, which is most definitely not. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  But the bar, the song. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=647.24s)]
*  That will be the title of my next album. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=651.76s)]
*  I'm already thinking and talking to Gus Seifert, who we've just walked together on a new version [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=654.52s)]
*  of Dark Side of the Moon that I made as a sort of homage to the 50-year-old version [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=660.72s)]
*  of it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=665.64s)]
*  And it's out now and it's doing very well, I'm happy to say. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=666.8s)]
*  People get it, which I wasn't sure. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=669.88s)]
*  What is it that you want them to get from that song? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=671.64s)]
*  From the new record of Dark Side of the Moon. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=674.56s)]
*  No, from the bar. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=676.52s)]
*  Oh, the bar. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=677.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, going on to the bar. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=678.52s)]
*  Well, the bar is a song that I wrote during COVID. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=680.52s)]
*  And just sitting there, spending a lot of time sitting at home at the piano and, you [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=686.64s)]
*  know, and kind of mucking around. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=690.68s)]
*  And also feeling mildly depressed about what's going on in the world and feeling the pain [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  everywhere and responding to it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  And I started to write about what it's like to meet people who you don't know as well [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=703.6s)]
*  as meeting your friends. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=711.2800000000001s)]
*  So the idea is if you go to the bar, the pub in England it would be, obviously, you go [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  to the pub and you meet your friends and you can have a drink and chat. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=717.2800000000001s)]
*  But you also meet strangers often because people feel that they can join in with the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=720.32s)]
*  conversation that's going on. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  So you meet people who have different opinions to you and you exchange opinions with them. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=727.0s)]
*  But you feel safe. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=733.24s)]
*  You don't feel like you often do, or I often do, that if you say something that they, that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=735.52s)]
*  the man doesn't like, you're liable to be dragged off and locked up. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=744.0s)]
*  Julian Assange, our good friend Julian Assange, a case in point. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=748.84s)]
*  They're killing him. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=753.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=755.0s)]
*  And they're trying to extradite him to the United States where they will kill him. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=755.76s)]
*  However, fast, slow, we don't know. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=759.8s)]
*  But that's what they're trying to do. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=761.84s)]
*  For speaking out, OK, he wasn't in a bar. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=764.52s)]
*  And he did organize a series of techniques to disseminate information to people who need [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=767.84s)]
*  it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=775.36s)]
*  But for that, which is not a crime, well, you know you, I mean, you are willy-nilly [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=775.72s)]
*  a publisher doing this. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=780.96s)]
*  This is a TV station, so you're publishing. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=782.84s)]
*  And for publishing the truth about things to be a crime for which you can be dragged [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=786.96s)]
*  off across the ocean and locked up forever. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=794.48s)]
*  And so because they disapprove of your opinion or your desire to share information with the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=797.24s)]
*  general public, that's a big thing. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=803.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, let me just interject there and ask you, though, because there was a report this week [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=807.4000000000001s)]
*  that came out in Globo that David and I were the target of illegal spying by the Brazilian [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=811.8000000000001s)]
*  sort of CIA or FBI, the Intelligence Agency of BEAN, during the Bolsonaro years for three [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=817.36s)]
*  years. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=822.6800000000001s)]
*  They were reading our emails and telephone calls. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  And one of the things I said when I was responding to the story on the show was I talked about [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=824.8800000000001s)]
*  how, on some level, when you're attacked and the target of reprisals by power centers, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=831.0s)]
*  on some level, even though it's not easy and can cause a lot of stress in your life, it's [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=838.84s)]
*  a tribute to the fact that you're being effective. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=843.84s)]
*  And whenever that has happened in my career when they tried to prosecute me or do anything [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=846.84s)]
*  like that, I've taken it on like that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=850.76s)]
*  I certainly think that's true of Julian. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=852.6s)]
*  The reason he's in prison is because he's the most important journalist of our generation. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=854.36s)]
*  And I'm wondering, as somebody who has been targeted with all sorts of character smears [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=859.68s)]
*  and attacks that I think have escalated in the last couple of years, the last 18 months, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=863.76s)]
*  I want to ask you about that and why. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=868.6s)]
*  But I'm wondering, are you able to, even through the difficulty of that, maintain that understanding [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=870.96s)]
*  that it's in part because you have expressed views that are threatening to people in power? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=876.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=882.24s)]
*  What you're talking about with me is the accusations of antisemitism. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=883.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=886.4s)]
*  It's because they have no answer to the argument. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=887.4s)]
*  You cannot defend the state of Israel in the genocide that's going on today and tomorrow [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=891.0s)]
*  and the day after. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=897.0s)]
*  Unless somehow you and I and all those good people who I met this morning in Rio who care [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=898.52s)]
*  about human rights intervene in some way to create enough of a noise, a loud enough choir [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=906.28s)]
*  for them to go, hang on a minute, let's just, maybe this isn't the best thing for me, which [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=913.72s)]
*  is because that's where politicians live. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=919.96s)]
*  They live in a world where how much good is this going to do me? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=923.56s)]
*  In my view. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=927.44s)]
*  That's only my view. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=928.44s)]
*  So you are right. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=929.44s)]
*  It is to some extent, and it shows that you at least have a platform and that people listen [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=932.6400000000001s)]
*  to it and that it is one that they do not want people to hear. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=937.96s)]
*  And my platform is tiny. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=943.7600000000001s)]
*  It's Paris 1948, Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=945.5200000000001s)]
*  Because I made a little video thing on the 11th of this month. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=950.48s)]
*  I was so devastated after the seventh and then eighth and then ninth and then the bombardments [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=955.8s)]
*  and Christian Garza and says, so what, how can, how do you respond to that? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=960.8399999999999s)]
*  I actually made a little video and it's had a few million views now. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=967.28s)]
*  So quite a lot of people have seen it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=971.52s)]
*  And basically I'm sitting there like that and I'm going, this is very simple. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=974.04s)]
*  You believe in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or not? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=980.9200000000001s)]
*  So it's a very small question. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=986.2800000000001s)]
*  So if I'm sitting opposite Netanyahu or somebody and he'll start talking, do you believe in [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=990.36s)]
*  the Universal Declaration, those 30 articles or not? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1000.96s)]
*  Well, now do you or don't you? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1004.5200000000001s)]
*  Because if you do, you cannot be following the foreign policy and domestic policy that [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1007.28s)]
*  you do because you don't, you believe in human rights for you, but not for them. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1015.4s)]
*  And the irony of this is a lot of these concepts of protecting civilians and the laws of war [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1021.9599999999999s)]
*  and crimes against humanity came after World War II as a response to the fact that we had [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  these two horrific wars and as weapons are getting more potent, we decided we needed, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1033.1200000000001s)]
*  we couldn't just say, oh, well in war everything is fair game. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1037.44s)]
*  We needed concepts that everybody was bound by and it was in part a response to the Holocaust [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1039.8s)]
*  and the murder of Jews, although not only. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1045.8s)]
*  And so to watch Israel then kind of turn around and become the leaders and insisting that [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1048.48s)]
*  that framework be abandoned or that it doesn't really apply to them is the height of irony. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1053.28s)]
*  But let me ask you, because you've always been a critic of the Israeli occupation of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1059.4s)]
*  the West Bank and the blockade of Gaza and the treatment of Palestinians and you've always [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1064.4s)]
*  been called anti-Semitic for that reason as any of us are who defend Palestinians. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm an opponent of the whole Zionist exercise. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1072.68s)]
*  Right, but I have, in my perception, these attacks on you have gotten a lot more escalated [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1075.88s)]
*  and a lot uglier and a lot more widespread and a lot more intense than let's say the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1082.52s)]
*  And you're not just somebody who speaks on Israel, you speak on the dirty war by the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1086.8s)]
*  CIA in Syria and the US NATO war in Ukraine. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1090.76s)]
*  Why do you think, first of all, do you agree it's gotten worse and if so, why do you think [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1094.32s)]
*  that's happening? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1097.2s)]
*  I think they're getting frightened. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1099.52s)]
*  I think critics of this, of that whole area of international politics get scared of people [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1102.9199999999998s)]
*  telling the truth. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1112.12s)]
*  I try to be as careful as I can to read as much, make sure I'm educated on whatever it [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1113.4399999999998s)]
*  is that I happen to be talking. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1119.84s)]
*  There's something, as I've explained before, that I learned from my mother. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1121.84s)]
*  One specific incident was I'm 13 years old and I'm trying to figure something out and [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1125.9599999999998s)]
*  my mother looks at me and she thinks, that boy's trying to figure something out. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1130.9199999999998s)]
*  So she says, come here, you know. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1135.12s)]
*  She said, oh, it's just something, she said, you're going to come across lots of difficult [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1136.9199999999998s)]
*  and knotty problems during your life, Roger. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1141.68s)]
*  And this is what you do. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1145.68s)]
*  If you'll take my advice, okay, mom, what is it? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1146.76s)]
*  She said, you read whatever it is you're trying to figure out. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1149.0s)]
*  Read, read, read all sides of the story. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1152.92s)]
*  Don't just read the things that affirm your views. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1155.5600000000002s)]
*  Read everything. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1158.8s)]
*  So that you, and ground yourself in it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1159.8s)]
*  For instance, if it's an international thing, look at the geography, read the history, find [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1162.52s)]
*  out. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  When you've done that, you've done all the heavy lifting, the hard work is over. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1168.08s)]
*  Well, what do I do then, mom? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1172.84s)]
*  And she said, the next bit's easy. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1174.96s)]
*  You do the right thing. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1177.6799999999998s)]
*  And there was a schoolmaster in the thing in the town hall in Rio today and he was talking [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1180.28s)]
*  about working with his children and about education and things like that. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1188.04s)]
*  I said, my mother was a teacher like you, you know, and you were teaching your children [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1193.12s)]
*  in your school exactly the same thing that she tried to teach me when I was a teenager. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1197.9599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, I'm digressing a bit. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1203.6799999999998s)]
*  What I wanted to ask you is, when I speak to, say, younger people who are entering journalism [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1206.52s)]
*  or finding a public platform for the first time and they ask me for advice, I always [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1212.1599999999999s)]
*  try and tell them, look, when you get attacked in these ways that are ugly and unjust and [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1215.7199999999998s)]
*  unfair, do your best not to take them personally because it's just how the game is played. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1220.32s)]
*  The reason that's happening is because you're saying things that they find threatening and [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  they don't want to engage with the argument. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1230.32s)]
*  As you said, they want to destroy your reputation. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1231.72s)]
*  But as somebody who has been called anti-Semitic thousands of times in the last two and a half [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1234.08s)]
*  weeks or so by condemning Israel's aggression in Gaza, I know that's easier said than done. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  So I'm wondering, are there times even when you have the confidence from having done all [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1244.56s)]
*  of this reading and you have the confidence that what you're doing is right, when these [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1248.84s)]
*  attacks and these accusations bother you? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1253.1599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  When they come close to succeeding, as for instance on my European tour recently, the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  Germans, the Israeli lobby in Germany, which is extremely powerful in Germany, you know, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1264.56s)]
*  they've made public protests for Palestine illegal. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
*  It's illegal in Germany now. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1277.68s)]
*  And in France, just all pro-Palestinian protest bands. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1279.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's all illegal. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1281.96s)]
*  So they're very hot on it. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1283.96s)]
*  And they tried to cancel my tour in Germany. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1287.5800000000002s)]
*  Moi. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1290.48s)]
*  Cancel him? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1291.48s)]
*  You know, what? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1292.48s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1293.48s)]
*  And on the grounds that I, two grounds, one that I'm a raging anti-Semite and two that [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1297.04s)]
*  I glorify the Third Reich. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1304.76s)]
*  What? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1307.4s)]
*  What? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1308.4s)]
*  I want to base that on his works of art. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1309.4s)]
*  There you see he has dressed in a leather coat. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1313.8000000000002s)]
*  And I go, well, hold on a minute. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1318.96s)]
*  It's satire. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1320.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, this is theater. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1321.3200000000002s)]
*  Which everyone has known. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1322.72s)]
*  Everyone knows the wall. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1323.96s)]
*  Everyone knows that character that you've been doing for years and suddenly they decided [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1325.1200000000001s)]
*  to pretend you were paying tribute to dictators in Hitler. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1328.68s)]
*  I've been doing it for 40 years, you morons. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1332.48s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1336.32s)]
*  And yeah, I had to go to court to get them off my back because in the Festhalle in Frankfurt, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1337.48s)]
*  the local council had canceled my show. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1345.48s)]
*  And I said, you can't do that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1349.32s)]
*  And luckily I went to court and I won the case and we did do the show. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1350.84s)]
*  But on the back of those attacks, the ADL, which is an American organization, the Anti-Defamation [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1355.44s)]
*  League that's been there for, I mean, I'm happy to say I've survived a number of presidents [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1364.2s)]
*  or directors of that. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1369.8400000000001s)]
*  I had lots of to and fro with Abe Foxman when he was still working. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1371.0800000000002s)]
*  Jonathan Greenblatt, the new bloke, I hardly know, whatever. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1375.56s)]
*  What did Jonathan Greenblatt, the new bloke, I'm making a new record of Dark Side of the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1379.92s)]
*  Moon Redux, it's called, and I've done a deal with BMG, which is Bertelsmann's music group. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1384.48s)]
*  They're going to release it because Sony, my record label, didn't want to release it [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1390.84s)]
*  because it would be seen to be in competition with what Pink Floyd are doing for the 50th [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1394.84s)]
*  album. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1399.92s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1400.92s)]
*  BMG are a good record. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1401.92s)]
*  Greenblatt got about 10 different organizations, like, I've forgotten what they're called, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1404.76s)]
*  the ones in Canada. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1412.04s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1413.64s)]
*  From all over, Stand With Us and Creative Something for Peace, you know, all of those. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1414.92s)]
*  They're all Israeli lobby house, but are organized. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1420.0s)]
*  They wrote a joint letter to Bertelsmann's, the parent company of BMG, and said, you cannot [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1423.32s)]
*  work with this man. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1428.48s)]
*  He's an anti-Semite. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1429.64s)]
*  And if you do, we're going to remind the public that you collaborated with the Nazis in World [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1430.72s)]
*  War II. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1436.92s)]
*  That threat, they threatened them with that. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1437.92s)]
*  No, it's such a potent threat. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1440.44s)]
*  Sorry, to finish this up. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1443.92s)]
*  Did they say, fuck you, Jonathan Greenblatt, we're a proper company and this is a great [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1446.4s)]
*  artist and we have his publishing and we supported him and he's a wonderful, you know, makes [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1453.4s)]
*  great records. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1458.4s)]
*  And no, they didn't. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1459.4s)]
*  They went, OK. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1460.4s)]
*  And they fired me. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1461.4s)]
*  Boom. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1463.4s)]
*  Well, when that happens, and they're sniffing around the door in Parliament, no less, in [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1464.4s)]
*  England, some awful MP stood up in Parliament and suggested that my shows in the O2 in London [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1471.64s)]
*  and in Manchester should be canceled just because of this. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1478.44s)]
*  So yes, so that was to answer your question. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1484.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it is uncomfortable at those points, particularly having a recording contract removed [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1487.92s)]
*  from under your nose because the ADL, they're a protection racket. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1497.36s)]
*  The ADL is a protection racket. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1503.76s)]
*  No, they openly say if we accuse you of antisemitism and you pay us $500,000 as they did with that [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1505.6399999999999s)]
*  NBA star, Keir Irving, who recommended a book. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1511.8799999999999s)]
*  And then they said, oh, there's a way out of it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1515.08s)]
*  Just pay us $500,000. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1516.6s)]
*  Which is pitiful, obviously. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1519.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's so blatant out in the open and they're exploiting what, you know, obviously [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1521.3999999999999s)]
*  they are these very strong and valid residual feelings about the Holocaust to essentially [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1525.96s)]
*  go around bullying this way by just threatening to destroy people's reputations unless you [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1530.6000000000001s)]
*  pay them. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1534.68s)]
*  And that is classic extortion. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1535.68s)]
*  There is, I don't know if you saw, I think we chatted about it briefly, but all that [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1537.64s)]
*  made its way to Brazil because here in Brazil, there are a lot of debates about the extent [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1542.96s)]
*  to which free speech should be permitted, whether things that are called hate speech [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1547.68s)]
*  or disinformation ought to be criminalized and barred. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1553.1599999999999s)]
*  And there's a kind of pro censorship movement, I think, in Brazil that is similar to Western [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1555.96s)]
*  Europe and in some way even worse. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1560.12s)]
*  And when that was happening, the justice minister here in Brazil, Flavio Dino, said, we think [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1561.56s)]
*  that if Roger Waters wants to come here and wear that uniform, that he may very well end [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1568.0s)]
*  up being arrested. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1574.1999999999998s)]
*  And what happened was the Brazilian left, who are supporters of yours, and obviously [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1575.56s)]
*  the base of Lula's government went ballistic and said, what do you, it was the first time [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1579.88s)]
*  I heard them with a backlash against censorship and only then did they rescind it, did he [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1584.6000000000001s)]
*  say like, obviously we're going to consider the context of what the message is. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1589.2s)]
*  Have you had any kind of messaging or communication from the Brazilian government about the possibility [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1592.8400000000001s)]
*  that you're being watched? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1597.2s)]
*  I think they said they're going to put federal agents at your show. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1598.2s)]
*  Ho-ho. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1601.64s)]
*  I did notice that story as it came up and I confess that I was somewhat disgruntled. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1603.16s)]
*  I thought, well, hold on a minute. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1609.64s)]
*  My mate Lula, who I tried to go and visit in prison as the bloody president of the government, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1611.76s)]
*  his justice minister, is conniving with others in this nonsense because the powers that are [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1616.24s)]
*  behind these attacks, it's worse in Argentina and some other countries. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1625.3600000000001s)]
*  The Israeli lobby is very, very powerful. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1633.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, what's happened to me over the last 20 years or so is the thing that pisses me [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1637.6000000000001s)]
*  off most, if I'm honest about it, I am honest about it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1643.52s)]
*  For instance, I was involved in a charity because I was asked to, working for a thing [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1647.52s)]
*  called Stand Up Heroes. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1654.48s)]
*  So it was stand up, it was comedians going to the Beacon Theatre once a year in New York [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1658.52s)]
*  raising money for badly wounded vets. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1665.08s)]
*  And Bob and Lee Woodruff are the names of the lovely couple who run it. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1668.4s)]
*  And they asked me if I would sing a song or something. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1673.68s)]
*  And I went, I'm not sure I want to be standing on a stage showing off around all these people [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1677.04s)]
*  with no arms and legs. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1683.0s)]
*  You know, and they said, well, we're having a cocktail party at the Natural History Museum. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1684.48s)]
*  Would you come along? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1690.28s)]
*  And so I went, yeah, OK, I can do that. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1691.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1694.72s)]
*  And have a look and meet a few people. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1695.72s)]
*  Yeah, OK. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1696.72s)]
*  So I walked into the big room with whales in it and stuff. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1697.72s)]
*  And there were all these vets and whatnot. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1701.04s)]
*  And there was one bloke sitting in a wheelchair, no legs, no only one arm, looking a bit on [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1703.4s)]
*  his own in his dress blues, a marine. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1708.8400000000001s)]
*  So I went over and I walked up and I kind of stood by his chair and I went, hello, how [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1712.24s)]
*  are you? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1717.52s)]
*  Have you got a drink or whatever? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1718.52s)]
*  And he was a bit like that. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1720.3999999999999s)]
*  And then he looked at me and then he went and he recognized me. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1721.84s)]
*  And he went, it's and I went, yeah, it is. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1726.8s)]
*  His name is Dom. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1729.12s)]
*  I'm good friends with this man now. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1730.12s)]
*  And he went and before he could think about anything, he went, well, I play the guitar. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1732.56s)]
*  And I thought that's a bit of a stretch. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1739.4799999999998s)]
*  And he saw me thinking that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1742.6399999999999s)]
*  And he went, well, I used to play the guitar. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1745.56s)]
*  And I went, yeah, well, and it was just about to get into whatever the hell we were going [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1749.44s)]
*  to talk about, right? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1755.3200000000002s)]
*  When he went, yeah, I don't play the guitar anymore. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1757.3200000000002s)]
*  And I went, no, obviously. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1759.96s)]
*  And he went, now I play the drums. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1761.24s)]
*  Which could work. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1763.4s)]
*  He had nothing here. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1766.4s)]
*  Here was from there. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1768.4s)]
*  He had a little bit stump here. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1771.64s)]
*  He had a prosthesis on it with a hole in the end for a drumstick. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1773.3600000000001s)]
*  And he's a bloody good drummer. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1778.32s)]
*  And you've seen him drum since? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1779.32s)]
*  Of course I have. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1781.12s)]
*  He's in a band called The Resilient. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1782.12s)]
*  And it's him and a guy called Tim Connolly. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1784.08s)]
*  And I'm not going to be able to produce the names of the other two guys who are in the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1787.48s)]
*  band now. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1791.52s)]
*  But Gee Smith and I used to go to Walter Reed every couple of weeks and work with these [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1792.52s)]
*  guys and we put on a show at the Beacon. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1797.3999999999999s)]
*  This was the point of the story. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1799.96s)]
*  Then we did it again the next year. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1801.52s)]
*  We moved into the theater upstairs at Madison Square Garden. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1804.04s)]
*  And the next year, which was 2014, so we did it 12, 13, and we were about to do it [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1807.28s)]
*  14. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1812.84s)]
*  When suddenly it was the middle of the summer, I realized I hadn't had the phone call. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1813.84s)]
*  And I thought, that's odd. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1818.56s)]
*  So I called a guy called Andrew Forgotten-His-Name, who had produced those two shows, and said, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1820.2s)]
*  why haven't I had the phone call asking me about dates in early November to do stand-up? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1826.0s)]
*  And he went a bit quiet. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1832.8799999999999s)]
*  I went, get your ass over here. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1833.8799999999999s)]
*  I need to know. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1836.36s)]
*  And he came over. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1837.36s)]
*  They said, we won't give you a single dollar more money if you work with Roger Waters. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1841.24s)]
*  He's an anti-Semite. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1847.96s)]
*  But what about the band? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1848.96s)]
*  What about the wounded men? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1852.04s)]
*  Fuck them. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1853.96s)]
*  They can't be on. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1854.96s)]
*  Because if they are, people will ask, well, where's Roger? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1857.04s)]
*  Who was the bloke called Cohen who paid them a billion dollars so he didn't have to go [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1861.08s)]
*  to prison? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1865.84s)]
*  Oh, I don't know what story you mean. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1866.84s)]
*  Oh, well, he was an exchange in control or whatever. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1872.04s)]
*  It was insider trading. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1878.56s)]
*  It was a big insider trading. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1880.28s)]
*  I'll find out and I'll send you his name. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1882.4s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen that. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1884.24s)]
*  It's a long time. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1885.24s)]
*  It's 10 years ago now. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1886.24s)]
*  Oh, Steve Cohen is the... [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1887.24s)]
*  Steve Cohen. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1890.24s)]
*  Steve Cohen. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1891.24s)]
*  That came from the control room. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1892.24s)]
*  He was the big sponsor of that year's thing. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1893.96s)]
*  He said, not a penny. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1898.44s)]
*  Oh, and that's who basically said, no Roger Waters. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1899.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1902.6000000000001s)]
*  So, first of all, let me just ask you about these issues with anti-Semitism for a second. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1903.6000000000001s)]
*  You talked about the horror and sickness and disgust you feel watching what the Israelis [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1909.8s)]
*  are doing in Gaza. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1914.88s)]
*  And I have to say for me, just... [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1915.88s)]
*  And maybe it's just a byproduct of things I focus on, but I honestly don't recall anything [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1917.8400000000001s)]
*  that has made me sicker or more disgusted than seeing the level of suffering that's [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1922.64s)]
*  taking place in Gaza right now and knowing that we're only at the beginning, way closer [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1927.8000000000002s)]
*  to the beginning than the end. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1931.48s)]
*  It's one of the worst crimes, if not the worst one I've seen in my life. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1933.3600000000001s)]
*  But when the attack on October 7th in Israel happened from Hamas, what was your reaction [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1937.64s)]
*  to that? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1943.8400000000001s)]
*  Let's wait and see what happened. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1944.8400000000001s)]
*  What was my first reaction? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1946.5600000000002s)]
*  My second reaction was, how the hell did the Israelis not know this was going to happen? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1948.84s)]
*  And I'm still a little bit down that rabbit hole. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1953.6s)]
*  I mean, didn't the Israeli army in those 10 or 11 camps hear the bangs when they blew [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1957.08s)]
*  up whatever they had to blow up to get across the border? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1964.1999999999998s)]
*  There's something very fishy about that. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1968.76s)]
*  Yeah, we had an Israeli Knesset member on who said, it seems inconceivable. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1970.6s)]
*  This is one of the most surveilled places on the planet. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1974.84s)]
*  And there's obviously going to be a lot of investigation, maybe not an honest one, but [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1978.2s)]
*  Israelis are angry about that as well. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1982.1200000000001s)]
*  What I'm asking about though is, do you think what Hamas did on October 7th can be justified? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1984.28s)]
*  Well, A, we don't know what they did do, but was it justified for them to resist the occupation? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=1991.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2000.24s)]
*  But again, it's what you said, it's the Geneva Conventions. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2001.24s)]
*  They are absolutely legally and morally bound to resist the occupation since 1967. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2004.8s)]
*  It's an obligation. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2012.96s)]
*  But are there limits on the way in which they can resist? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2014.3999999999999s)]
*  As I said in the statement that I put out after it, I said if war crimes were committed, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2017.36s)]
*  I condemn them. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2023.28s)]
*  I don't care who it is. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2025.28s)]
*  And here we are now three weeks or so after, do you think there's been evidence that's [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2026.72s)]
*  emerged that suggests they committed those? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2031.04s)]
*  There may have been individualist things. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2034.0s)]
*  I was reading a new story this morning, which Grazem, our friend Max Blumenthal, so there's [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2035.92s)]
*  a long story which I read this morning, but Haaretz have finally come out with figures [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2044.28s)]
*  of how many people were actually killed and who they were. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2050.68s)]
*  On that day, yeah. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2053.64s)]
*  On that day, yeah. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2054.64s)]
*  And so probably the first 400 were Israeli military personnel. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2055.8s)]
*  Who are? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2061.16s)]
*  That is not a war crime. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2062.16s)]
*  No, clearly everyone thinks military officials and military targets or soldiers in Israel [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2063.56s)]
*  are military targets. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2070.08s)]
*  Well, it depends if you believe in the Geneva Conventions or not. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2071.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2074.2s)]
*  Or the United Nations. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2075.2s)]
*  But what about targeting civilians or abducting them? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2076.2s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2079.6s)]
*  No, of course I don't condone that. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2080.6s)]
*  But the thing was thrown out of all proportion by the Israelis making up stories about beheading [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2084.72s)]
*  babies. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2093.12s)]
*  They even got the President of the United States, dotard that he is, to claim that he [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2094.12s)]
*  had seen photographs. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2100.88s)]
*  Of the beheaded babies. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2103.6s)]
*  Of the beheaded babies. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2104.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2105.6s)]
*  And then admitted that he actually didn't. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2106.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2108.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's, but what we do know is whether it was a false flag operation or [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2109.6s)]
*  not or whatever or whatever happened and whatever story we're going to get to, and we don't [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2116.6s)]
*  know if we will ever get much of a real story. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2122.8s)]
*  It's very, it's always hard to tell what actually happened. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2126.04s)]
*  They're calling it their 9-11. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2129.6000000000004s)]
*  What the hell happened on the American 9-11? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2131.6800000000003s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2134.44s)]
*  Clearly the official narrative has huge holes in it. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2135.44s)]
*  And anyway, let's not go into the 9-11. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2141.2400000000002s)]
*  But I guess the, I guess the, when people, there are two kinds of people I think who [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2144.4s)]
*  raises anti-Semitism accusation against not only you, but people like you, but let's say [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2148.94s)]
*  in your case, one is because you criticize the Israeli government. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2154.5800000000004s)]
*  The other is the claim that you seem to value Palestinian lives more than Israeli lives. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2157.6600000000003s)]
*  That's absolute patent nonsense. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2164.78s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2168.2200000000003s)]
*  What is your, how do you say? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2169.2200000000003s)]
*  Complete rubbish. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2170.2200000000003s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2171.2200000000003s)]
*  This is the whole point of the difference between my platform and the Israeli government. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2173.94s)]
*  I believe in equal human rights for all our brothers and sisters all over the world, irrespective [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2180.2999999999997s)]
*  of their ethnicity, religion or nationality. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2188.7s)]
*  The Israeli government doesn't. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2193.66s)]
*  For instance, just in that locale there, what we could call the holy land if we wanted to, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2197.1s)]
*  they consider that people who are of the Jewish religion have completely different set of [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2204.58s)]
*  rights to everybody else. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2211.9s)]
*  This is fundamentally important. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2215.22s)]
*  That's why in my message I go, do you subscribe to the idea of equal human rights or not? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2217.18s)]
*  Because as soon as you don't, you are a Nazi. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2225.78s)]
*  And I know people, you can't say Nazi. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2230.2200000000003s)]
*  The Nazi ideology is not unique to Germans. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2233.3s)]
*  It could be anybody who adopts that view that some human life is more valuable than others. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2235.9s)]
*  Anybody who is supremacist is whatever you want to call it, a fascist. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2240.7000000000003s)]
*  Or you just say, oh, he's, she, they are those people who consider themselves superior to [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2246.42s)]
*  That's why they call them animals. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2254.42s)]
*  That's why they dehumanize them. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2256.38s)]
*  That's why they are committing genocide on them today. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2258.94s)]
*  I'm sorry to grit my teeth, but I weep at you. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2263.94s)]
*  No, it's horrific. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2266.2200000000003s)]
*  You're saying this is the most horrific thing in your life. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2267.2200000000003s)]
*  It is in my lifetime. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2269.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm 80 years old. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2270.98s)]
*  This is the most horrific thing to happen in front of my eyes. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2272.6600000000003s)]
*  And yet the government of the United States of America where I live. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2278.6600000000003s)]
*  The end of the UK. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2283.18s)]
*  And, and yet the UK, I don't live there anymore. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2284.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2288.8999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2289.8999999999996s)]
*  But and all the vassal states in the European community are all just giving the Israelis [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2290.8999999999996s)]
*  cop watch to murder two men. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2299.14s)]
*  Why are they doing that? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2301.4199999999996s)]
*  You tell me, Glenn. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2303.62s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2304.8199999999997s)]
*  It has something to do with some kind of political expediency that I don't understand. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2307.42s)]
*  Well, we just had, I just about two weeks ago, we interviewed Professor Stephen Walt [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2313.2200000000003s)]
*  and then yesterday we interviewed Professor John Mearsheimer, both of whom co-wrote the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2318.2200000000003s)]
*  book The Israel Abbey in 2006. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2322.34s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure you do, which purported to explain where this kind of influence comes [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2323.94s)]
*  from and they were very clear that it's not just the standard obvious response of, well, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2330.78s)]
*  there's a lot of American Jews and Western Jews who exercise a lot of political influence. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2335.78s)]
*  There's also, you go to Congress as one of my friends who's a journalist, Lee Fong did, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2339.6600000000003s)]
*  and we interviewed him last night too. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2344.1000000000004s)]
*  And he went and interviewed a bunch of members of Congress and said, why is your posture [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2345.98s)]
*  that you want to give the Israeli government anything at once, that there's no criticism [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2350.5800000000004s)]
*  permitted, that they'll never say no to the Israelis? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2355.46s)]
*  What kind of country has that posture toward others? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2358.1600000000003s)]
*  And a lot of them will openly say it's because we believe religiously that Israel has to [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2360.0600000000004s)]
*  be strong because only then can Jesus return and have this like rapture-like event. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2365.7s)]
*  So they're Christian fascists. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2370.62s)]
*  Well, they're, yeah, they're hardcore Christian Zionists who somehow are Christians and yet [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2371.62s)]
*  don't value Palestinian life. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2376.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, because they don't subscribe to my view, which is that we're all equal. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2378.62s)]
*  We're brothers and sisters. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2382.8599999999997s)]
*  We're all African. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2383.8599999999997s)]
*  It was 150,000 years ago. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2385.8599999999997s)]
*  There were very few of us and we were from Africa and we spread out over this world and, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2388.66s)]
*  you know, various of us settled in different places and because of the weather and because [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2394.46s)]
*  we intermarried, some of us look different from others. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2398.78s)]
*  But we now know because of the genome, human genome, we know that we're all cousins. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2401.7s)]
*  We're all related. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2407.1s)]
*  And my goodness, particularly the Jewish people who claim that their ancestors are from the [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2408.58s)]
*  Holy Land are incredibly closely related to the Palestinians whose ancestors, they're [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2417.06s)]
*  all Semites. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2422.94s)]
*  If they have geographical associations with Israel and or Palestine, they are all cousins. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2425.38s)]
*  They're close cousins. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2433.2200000000003s)]
*  So this is bizarre. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2435.2200000000003s)]
*  And do you know what? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2437.86s)]
*  I think it simply has to do with wealth and power. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2438.86s)]
*  Those are the two defining invasions. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2443.94s)]
*  Well, why does this close relationship with Israel and this kind of obsessive support for [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2447.2200000000003s)]

*  Well, they need to promote disharmony all over the world. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2454.3s)]
*  The United States foreign policy is basically about promoting disharmony as best it can, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2458.38s)]
*  creating mayhem, causing wars like the one in the Ukraine, which you've spoken to me, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2464.94s)]
*  Isham or whatever, and you've done your reading. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2472.3s)]
*  You know the history. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2475.5s)]
*  You know the history of Ukraine. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2477.1000000000004s)]
*  You know that Khrushchev did all that when the USSR was going full circle in 1955 or [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2479.62s)]
*  six or whenever it was, the Ukraine was. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2485.1s)]
*  You know all of this stuff, but most people have no idea. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2487.54s)]
*  Most people buy the idea that Russia unprovoked invaded the Ukraine on February 24, 2022 or [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2490.72s)]
*  whenever it was. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2501.9s)]
*  I saw an interview with George Lucas, the producer and director of Star Wars, among [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2503.9s)]
*  other things, and he was being interviewed by James Cameron. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2510.3s)]
*  It was probably about 10 years ago. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2512.54s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever seen this, but he was confessing something amazing, which [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2513.7000000000003s)]
*  was that when he made Star Wars, the empire that he had in mind that everybody was supposed [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2518.7400000000002s)]
*  to root against was the United States and the scrappy kind of guerrillas who were using [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2524.6600000000003s)]
*  inferior weapons but had this kind of spirit that would let them bring down the empire [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2530.06s)]
*  were the North Vietnamese. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2534.58s)]
*  And this was, the film was released in 1976. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2537.02s)]
*  Imagine what Americans would have thought had they known that. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2539.7s)]
*  And it was kind of this very subversive message buried in Star Wars. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2543.34s)]
*  Were there political themes or political messages from the start in Pink Floyd's music as you [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2548.62s)]
*  saw them in the 60s and 70s? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2554.98s)]
*  Let me tell you this. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2560.82s)]
*  I think, you know, because at the beginning of our career, 65, 66, whatever, when Sid [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2562.9s)]
*  came up to London to share an apartment with me and blah, blah, blah, and Sid started to [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2569.82s)]
*  write songs, thank goodness, and great songs they were, were we very politically motivated? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2575.02s)]
*  Not in terms of the music that we were doing. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2583.86s)]
*  We were a blues band until we branched out, mainly because of Sid's songwriting. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2586.06s)]
*  I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like, it's got a basket, a bell that rings and things [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2591.98s)]
*  to make it look good. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2596.42s)]
*  I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2597.42s)]
*  We don't need to go there into kind of with the seminar about what a great songwriter [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2601.3s)]
*  Sid was. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2605.22s)]
*  Was I political? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2607.02s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2608.02s)]
*  I marched from Aldermaston to Trafalgar Square once and from Finchingfield to Trafalgar Square [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2609.02s)]
*  once in the CND. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2614.18s)]
*  I was the chairman of the Young Socialists in Cambridge when I was 15 years old, and [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2617.2999999999997s)]
*  also of the YCND there and blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2622.4199999999996s)]
*  My parents, my father was dead, he was killed at Anzio. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2625.74s)]
*  My mother was a communist up until 56 when she left in protest of the Russian invasion [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2628.66s)]
*  of Budapest in 1956. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2637.1s)]
*  So yeah, my background is steeped in attachment. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2640.62s)]
*  The bottom drawer of the desk in our front room was full of hidden, forbidden books with [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2647.98s)]
*  photographs of what Bogan Belson and Auschwitz were like in the case of Auschwitz when the [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2654.22s)]
*  Russians went in and freed everybody who was in there. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2660.2999999999997s)]
*  And so one of my mom's best friends, Claudette Kennedy, you know, she's got the Auschwitz [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2666.02s)]
*  thing on her wrist and she was in a state of total turmoil and terror. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2671.5s)]
*  And I was like, I'm this little kid watching this going on. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2677.14s)]
*  Her kids were never allowed out of her sight because she was so traumatized. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2681.06s)]
*  I'm getting quite emotional even thinking about it because even talking about Claudette [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2686.9s)]
*  Kennedy and her children 75 years ago brings up into me what's happening in Gaza today. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2693.02s)]
*  When you see that Al Jazeera chief holding his dead son in his arms, they killed his [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2702.14s)]
*  whole family. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2707.82s)]
*  And that happened to family after family after family. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2708.82s)]
*  And Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak are going, oh, they have a right to defend. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2713.34s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2719.58s)]
*  Defend themselves? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2722.94s)]
*  This is arron nonsense and everybody knows it. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2724.54s)]
*  And by the way, if you go back and read Lord Balfour's letter from 1970, it's only that [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2728.34s)]
*  long. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2735.1s)]
*  It's not. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2736.1s)]
*  It's that long. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2737.1s)]
*  And the first bit says, Her Majesty's government looks with favor on the plan for make a homeland [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2738.1s)]
*  for the Jewish people in Palestine, British Mandate Palestine. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2743.82s)]
*  And then the second paragraph says, So long as there in no way interferes with the religious [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2748.18s)]
*  or civil rights of the indigenous people who non-Jewish who are now living there. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2754.52s)]
*  That's the second half of the Balfour letter. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2761.7799999999997s)]
*  And I know you're humming me, but... [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2764.3799999999997s)]
*  No, I'm not humming you in the sense that I want you to stop. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2766.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm humming you in the sense that I agree and I understand and I want people to hear [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2769.8599999999997s)]
*  this. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2774.4199999999996s)]
*  And then, and that's a year after Mr. Sykes and Mr. Pico had drawn the arbitrary shape [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2775.42s)]
*  of Iraq and Syria and all those things in the middle of the bloody First World War. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2781.34s)]
*  So yeah, what I'm saying is that Zionism failed before it started because it was not a desert. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2787.7400000000002s)]
*  It was a flourishing cosmopolitan, many different faiths and peoples and blood and it had exchanged [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2799.18s)]
*  hands umpteen times and the Ottomans and the Crusaders and maybe King David at some point. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2807.66s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2814.54s)]
*  But this was not an empty spot on the map where you could take a few million people [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2815.54s)]
*  and say, there you are, now built. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2820.94s)]
*  Oh, and there was all kinds of peaceful and thriving interactions between Muslims and [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2822.82s)]
*  Jews and Palestinians. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2828.54s)]
*  Always. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2830.02s)]
*  But, so obviously there's a group of people who think that simply to be opposed to Zionism, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2831.02s)]
*  a brand new ideology that didn't even exist until the beginning of the 20th century, is [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2836.46s)]
*  to be anti-Semitic. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2841.54s)]
*  And I just, part of me even hates kind of asking you about this accusation because I [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2842.9s)]
*  feel like I'm dignifying it when I do, but the other side makes me feel like, look, people [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2848.58s)]
*  have heard this about you and so I think it's important to always give you the opportunity [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2853.7799999999997s)]
*  to defend yourself even though I wish that wasn't necessary, but it is. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2858.1s)]
*  So you talk- [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2862.42s)]
*  Do you know how many people there are in the world who know whether I'm an anti-Semite [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2863.42s)]
*  or not? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2866.7799999999997s)]
*  A small portion. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2867.7799999999997s)]
*  One. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2868.7799999999997s)]
*  Do you know who that is? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2869.7799999999997s)]
*  You. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2871.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2872.06s)]
*  I live in this body. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2873.06s)]
*  This is my heart. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2874.7799999999997s)]
*  You think I wouldn't know if I was an anti-Semite? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2876.5400000000004s)]
*  What? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2880.46s)]
*  We know what our feelings are. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2883.1000000000004s)]
*  But I want to ask you about that because this moment that you just had a few minutes ago [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2884.6200000000003s)]
*  where you got emotional thinking about a Holocaust survivor, these books that you said you read [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2887.94s)]
*  and were obviously moved by about the horrors of Auschwitz and the like. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2891.7400000000002s)]
*  Do you have, and have you always had, Jewish people in your life who are important in your [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2898.5400000000004s)]
*  life who- [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2903.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2904.66s)]
*  Like I said, I even hate asking that, but I think I want people to know that. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2905.66s)]
*  Yes, of course I have. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2911.74s)]
*  And do you know what's a weird thing? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2913.74s)]
*  Here's a weird thing. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2914.74s)]
*  Part of the accusations, there was some weird saxophone player who played in my band for [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2917.22s)]
*  about three minutes in 2002 or something, 20 years ago, and came out and was explaining [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2922.54s)]
*  how, all kinds of weird stuff, which I didn't recognise at all in any way. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2929.26s)]
*  Why am I telling you this? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2938.5s)]
*  I know why. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2941.3s)]
*  Because this came out into conversation here. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2943.54s)]
*  There's a guy, I'm not going to tell you who he is, but there's a guy who's working for [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2946.02s)]
*  me in my crew now. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2950.5s)]
*  He's been working for me for well over 20 years. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2951.86s)]
*  And I was talking to my production manager about another kid who was an Israeli kid who [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2956.5s)]
*  was on the crew for the whole of the war tour that I did, and who had concerns about some [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2961.66s)]
*  of the things I would say about Israel. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2969.38s)]
*  He was an Israeli, obviously Jewish, and so he confronted me about it. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2971.22s)]
*  And I talked to him, and I've got a lovely letter he wrote when he left saying, this [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2975.98s)]
*  was the best years I've ever spent in my life. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2980.42s)]
*  I don't agree with you about absolute everything, but I admire you. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2983.14s)]
*  And I really look forward to seeing you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and stuff [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2987.7s)]
*  like that. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2991.54s)]
*  And my production manager said, well, yeah, I like... [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2992.7799999999997s)]
*  And then he mentioned another name, and I went, who? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2995.2999999999997s)]
*  And I went, oh, and mentioned a specific job. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=2999.1s)]
*  And the guy said, you know what, you know he's Jewish. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3003.2599999999998s)]
*  And I said, no, I had no idea. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3007.7799999999997s)]
*  It never crosses my mind what somebody's religion is or their ethnicity. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3011.14s)]
*  I couldn't care less. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3016.22s)]
*  That's how I know that I'm... [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3018.3399999999997s)]
*  That's how I'm the one person who knows whether Roger Waters is 90% or not, and I'm not. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3022.14s)]
*  Why, like I said, you do talk about other issues, Syria and Ukraine and US foreign policy, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3027.86s)]
*  Western foreign policy, a lot of different things, but this is an issue of great passion [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3032.66s)]
*  for you, as I can see here watching you talk about this. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3037.54s)]
*  They're committing genocide. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3040.5s)]
*  Why is this issue, how did this become such an important issue to you of the all sort [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3042.0600000000004s)]
*  of very different types of human suffering on the planet? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3047.6600000000003s)]
*  It's no more important to me than the Rohingya, or the slaughter in Indonesia after Suharta [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3051.78s)]
*  of anybody who was communist for it. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3061.5s)]
*  They just curled them and threw them in the... [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3063.78s)]
*  That's no worse than the Israelis bombing Gaza. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3066.82s)]
*  It's exactly the same. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3070.22s)]
*  It's murdering people for gain is what it is. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3073.06s)]
*  It's either gain of power or gain of their property or gain of their land. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3078.54s)]
*  It's stealing something. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3083.2599999999998s)]
*  And it disgusts me whoever or whatever it is. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3086.4599999999996s)]
*  And I wasn't there at the time, but if I... [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3090.02s)]
*  But for instance, United States, we know that there was a genocide of the Native American [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3092.8599999999997s)]
*  people, not just in North America here as well. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3099.06s)]
*  The Portuguese in this country or in Argentina or wherever, wherever. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3103.9s)]
*  Yeah, they colonized Brazil and there was an indigenous population. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3109.02s)]
*  So that settles colonialism and it was disgusting. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3111.5s)]
*  And what followed on from it was slavery. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3114.46s)]
*  And that was disgusting too. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3117.1s)]
*  And we're still living with the aftermath of those ideologies which were disgusting. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3119.22s)]
*  They came from Europe and they were disgusting. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3126.98s)]
*  And we're only just now... [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3130.6600000000003s)]
*  Like my meeting this morning in Rio de Janeiro here, where they gave me a medal for caring [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3133.06s)]
*  about human rights. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3138.34s)]
*  You know, there's one guy stood up and made a speech and he's from the Landless Workers, WTS. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3140.98s)]
*  Yeah, you know, and you go, come here, brother, let me give you... [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3148.1800000000003s)]
*  Because I've read about you. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3151.5s)]
*  I know what you're trying to do to save your country from the Balsanaras of this world [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3153.38s)]
*  who want to sell it so they can put the money in their back pocket and piss off somewhere. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3159.26s)]
*  Or stay there and run the police force and have people killed or whatever they do. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3165.38s)]
*  I mean, I may be being a bit unkind, but I'm... [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3170.86s)]
*  No, I think it's... [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3173.42s)]
*  I mean, I think it's important that people see this kind of strain that drives you on [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3174.42s)]
*  Israel and Palestine is a strain that drives you to comment on a lot of things. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3180.94s)]
*  And I want to ask you, there are musicians, like kind of just cultural celebrities in [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3185.58s)]
*  general who avoid doing what you're doing for obvious reasons. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3190.42s)]
*  You know, Michael Jordan famously or notoriously said, when asked why he never comments on [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3193.78s)]
*  political controversies, he said, Republicans buy sneakers too. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3198.54s)]
*  And I want to know, was there a point when you had to debate, like, am I going to alienate [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3202.82s)]
*  people with political views who might otherwise like my music? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3209.2599999999998s)]
*  Or was it just this instinct in you, taught given by your mother or maybe other influence, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3212.8599999999997s)]
*  to say, no, I'm always going to kind of do what I feel right regardless of the consequences [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3217.54s)]
*  or the harm it might have for my career? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3221.8599999999997s)]
*  No, they almost got to me recently this year when I was 79 years old, thinking about, oh, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3223.66s)]
*  my God, can I wear the leather coat or not? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3231.14s)]
*  Or will they cut my balls off and feed them to the wolves? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3234.1s)]
*  And I'll be a homeless old man shivering in a fucking blanket, you know, by the road. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3237.98s)]
*  They're scary because they're so vicious and they will stop at absolutely nothing. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3243.82s)]
*  So do you regret sometimes wading into these debates given all that? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3251.18s)]
*  No, no, because I actually said this to the people there this morning in the meeting, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3255.58s)]
*  I don't know if they got it or not, but every year I make the same New Year's resolution, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3263.8999999999996s)]
*  and I have done for maybe 10 years or so. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3270.4599999999996s)]
*  And because I've finally figured out what it is, and it is this. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3273.66s)]
*  I resolve for the forthcoming year, I'm going to carry on doing the best I can. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3280.54s)]
*  So there's no. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3286.8599999999997s)]
*  Do I mean that or trying to do the best I can? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3289.98s)]
*  It's not the best I can because I always think it's a terrible burden to put on yourself [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3293.42s)]
*  or anywhere else. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3298.7s)]
*  You have to do your best. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3299.5s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3300.7s)]
*  You have to do the best you can. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3302.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, so I don't know why that's relevant, but it's relevant to me. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3303.9s)]
*  No, what I was asking was, I mean, you know, I noticed before when I take a certain view [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3309.02s)]
*  or when I devote my journalism to a certain topic, you can see the material harm. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3314.62s)]
*  You can see people who write to you and say, oh, I'm so disappointed. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3320.46s)]
*  I can't support your work anymore. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3324.46s)]
*  I can't watch a show anymore. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3325.74s)]
*  I'm so disappointed to your learn your this or your that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3327.18s)]
*  And of course, there's a part of you that says, maybe I would have been better off just [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3329.5s)]
*  not doing that, not having to speak about that. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3333.8199999999997s)]
*  And I guess maybe it's a personality trait. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3337.8199999999997s)]
*  But for me, I just don't have the ability to refrain. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3339.5s)]
*  I don't want to go home at night. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3342.78s)]
*  You're somebody who has to do the right thing like me. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3344.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know where you got your instruction from. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3346.86s)]
*  Mine came from my mother. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3349.02s)]
*  But it's like you were talking about early days of Pink Floyd and politics. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3351.1000000000004s)]
*  My story in Pink Floyd, and it's a big, big part of the Pink Floyd story, was when one day [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3357.26s)]
*  we were making in 1970, we were making an album called Medal and it had a long track on it called [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3363.1000000000004s)]
*  Echoes. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3371.82s)]
*  And I started writing lyrics to it. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3372.7000000000003s)]
*  And the beginning of it was a bit wishy washy and you know, over the albatross hangs motionless [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3375.1000000000004s)]
*  upon the air. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3381.42s)]
*  It reminds me of the frigate birds outside the fissona, which are beautiful. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3382.3s)]
*  And I went anyway. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3386.7000000000003s)]
*  And then I suddenly wrote this verse. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3388.2200000000003s)]
*  Two strangers passing in the street by chance to passing glances meet. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3390.6200000000003s)]
*  And I am you. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3396.3s)]
*  And what I see is me. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3397.7400000000002s)]
*  And do I take you by the hand and help us understand and something some some the best [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3400.2200000000003s)]
*  we can or whatever it is. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3405.98s)]
*  And no one asks us to move on and no one forces down our eyes and no one. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3407.98s)]
*  But no one speaks and no one tries and no one flies around the sun. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3415.7400000000002s)]
*  Sort of teenage and slightly six for me as those lyrics are. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3421.66s)]
*  It gives me a slight shiver because it was my heart this non anti-semitic heart that [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3427.9s)]
*  beats in my chest telling me that there's something magical about the fact that we're [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3435.9s)]
*  all related and that we're human beings and that we have a responsibility to love one [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3441.5s)]
*  another and try and figure this whole unholy mess out so that we're not murdering the head [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3447.58s)]
*  of Al Jazeera's children in the middle of fucking night. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3457.74s)]
*  So he has to go down there in the morning. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3461.02s)]
*  And you obviously you never if that happens to you, that's the end of your life. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3462.9399999999996s)]
*  You might that's never never never going to get. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3469.18s)]
*  And it's like that. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3473.5s)]
*  I watched again that Farina Boussi's little film. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3474.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a 13 minute short and it's just called Gaza Nightmare. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3478.22s)]
*  And she made it after the 2014. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3481.9799999999996s)]
*  What was that cast led? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3484.62s)]
*  I think it was that. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3486.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3487.5s)]
*  You mean the Israeli bombing of Gaza. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3488.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3490.62s)]
*  And it's very, very moving and very, very descriptive. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3490.94s)]
*  It's about a woman finding a way home through the bomb street and arriving and seeing that [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3495.42s)]
*  there's a hole where her sister's house is and realizing that her baby's dead. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3501.82s)]
*  You know, and that's happening all over Gaza now. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3509.9s)]
*  And why? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3514.54s)]
*  Because the Zionists want to steal that bit. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3515.1s)]
*  They want to steal everything. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3519.5s)]
*  They want them gone. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3520.86s)]
*  And they're quite to give them their due. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3521.9s)]
*  They make no bones about it. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3524.62s)]
*  There are, of course, there is a resistance in Israel. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3526.22s)]
*  For sure. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3529.18s)]
*  A big issue, but they don't get any grip on on any seat of power. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3529.9s)]
*  Gideon Levi sits there every day writing those incredibly moving columns about what they're [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3536.46s)]
*  doing, but they don't. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3541.98s)]
*  Well, that's what's amazing is, I mean, before this whole thing happened with Hamas's invasion [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3544.46s)]
*  and the like, Israel was kind of on the brink of a civil war. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3549.02s)]
*  There's all this tension between the ultra-orthodox and the secular Israelis, but also this idea that [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3552.22s)]
*  for a long time, the kind of thing that led American Jews in the West comfortably support [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3559.26s)]
*  Israel was this dream of a two-state solution. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3563.58s)]
*  And now the most important parts of Netanahu's government don't even pretend to want to. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3565.74s)]
*  They don't want a two-state solution. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3570.14s)]
*  They want to drive the Palestinians out of the West Bank and Gaza and take it over and [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3571.34s)]
*  make it part of greater Israel. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3575.7400000000002s)]
*  They never did. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3577.34s)]
*  Those part people didn't. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3578.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there were people who Israelis who lost their lives like Gitzach Rabin and others [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3579.58s)]
*  pursuing peace. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3583.98s)]
*  I think there were Israelis who but they're gone. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3585.02s)]
*  They're marginalized. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3587.5s)]
*  They're they're not the people in power any longer. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3588.38s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3590.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, they never really were in power, in my view, looking back at that piece of Israeli [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3591.26s)]
*  history. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3596.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, it's interesting in Mikko Pelleh's book, The General's Son, which I'm sure you've [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3597.52s)]
*  read, but because his father was I don't know if he was chief chief of staff or just very [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3603.04s)]
*  high up in the IDF after the 67 war when they won that very fast with their sneak attack. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3609.7599999999998s)]
*  Let us not forget. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3617.2799999999997s)]
*  They were not attacked by anybody. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3618.48s)]
*  They attacked Syria and Egypt in the same minute almost. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3620.7200000000003s)]
*  But after it, this guy, Mikko Pelleh's father went to the cabinet and went, that's it. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3626.32s)]
*  We've won. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3632.32s)]
*  We're in a very strong position. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3632.88s)]
*  Now we can give Palestine their state. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3634.32s)]
*  Small. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3637.1200000000003s)]
*  All right. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3637.92s)]
*  But weaker. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3638.7200000000003s)]
*  And then we can live in peace. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3639.52s)]
*  And they looked at one another and all burst out laughing. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3641.52s)]
*  Are you insane? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3644.7200000000003s)]
*  We're not giving them anything. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3645.92s)]
*  We're not giving them anything. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3647.52s)]
*  We're not giving them a postage stamp. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3648.72s)]
*  We're getting rid of them. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3650.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3651.92s)]
*  And I think, I mean, when you look what the Israelis are doing now with, you know, saying [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3652.72s)]
*  get out of northern Gaza at the same time pressuring Egypt to open that quarter, they [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3656.64s)]
*  want to drive them into the Sinai. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3661.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3663.04s)]
*  Living in tents. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3663.6s)]
*  Force them to live in tents and take over Gaza and rebuild it, pretending they're rebuilding [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3664.4s)]
*  it for them to come back. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3668.48s)]
*  And of course, they're never going to come back and that's going to become part of. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3669.28s)]
*  They can go into partnership with Donald Trump. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3671.68s)]
*  That was always his plan. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3674.88s)]
*  Let's just turn Gaza into a golf course. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3676.72s)]
*  Resort. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3679.6s)]
*  The idea, I just wanted, with the time we have left, to ask you a couple just questions [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3680.16s)]
*  about things a little bit unrelated, but still related. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3684.0s)]
*  I know you're not, you don't live in the UK anymore for reasons, personally at least, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3688.72s)]
*  that I understand completely. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3691.9199999999996s)]
*  But I've done a lot of work, a lot of my journalism involved the UK. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3693.6s)]
*  Certainly the Snowden story had a lot to do with the UK. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3696.7999999999997s)]
*  And I've kind of walked away of all the kind of elite cultures that I loathe. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3699.2799999999997s)]
*  I think the British elite culture is the one I have the most contempt for. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3705.6s)]
*  And when I was doing the Snowden story, the GCHQ was always the worst of the worst, worse [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3709.8399999999997s)]
*  than even anything I say. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3714.08s)]
*  The British media were always most subservient. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3714.96s)]
*  And when it comes to war, the British, the modern day British pundit and journalist and [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3717.36s)]
*  sort of politician seems to have a almost visceral arousal for talking about war. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3722.88s)]
*  They like to think they're Chilean. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3729.6s)]
*  This is always the kind of need to posture as tough guys, is these kind of people who [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3731.68s)]
*  are just so steadfast, stiff upper lip, this kind of mythology that has been fed to them. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3735.8399999999997s)]
*  And every time there's a new war, they're the ones most aggressively demanding that [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3741.12s)]
*  their government support it. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3746.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you agree with that or not, but if you do, why is that? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3747.9199999999996s)]
*  What explains that? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3751.52s)]
*  Maybe it's the island people syndrome, the little England island people syndrome. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3754.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe it's the traumatic response to all those Danes and Saxons attacking. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3761.2s)]
*  Then the Saxons eventually became the indigenous people. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3770.56s)]
*  So the Brits originally, you had the Norsemen under this. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3774.64s)]
*  They were constantly attacking this little piece of plum on the other side of La Manche. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3779.7599999999998s)]
*  So maybe it's developed from that. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3786.08s)]
*  And of course, there's a huge history as well of being the most successful colonialist, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3788.64s)]
*  vicious invading, stealing, plundering armies of all by far for hundreds of years. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3796.7999999999997s)]
*  And so maybe they remember that as the good times because I guess if you are the conquistadors, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3805.52s)]
*  that maybe there's something addictive about that. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3815.04s)]
*  We don't know because we weren't there. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3820.24s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3822.08s)]
*  Yeah, but it gets passed down culturally, I think through the generations. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3824.0s)]
*  And Churchill, they build the mythology. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3828.24s)]
*  Churchill is a complete asshole. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3831.6s)]
*  Everybody knows it who can read. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3834.56s)]
*  This is the problem. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3837.52s)]
*  I mean, what he did with the treatment of India and just a lot of his comments about [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3838.56s)]
*  30 million people. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3843.04s)]
*  In a year. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3845.92s)]
*  So just a couple more questions and then we'll end. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3847.2s)]
*  But one of the, I think a lot of what we've been talking about has to do with an attempt [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3850.3199999999997s)]
*  to shut down debate. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3855.68s)]
*  You have the song The Bar that's about that kind of debate, the ability to disagree without this [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3857.52s)]
*  recrimination. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3862.48s)]
*  I think calling people like you anti-semite is a way of trying to prevent them from being [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3863.2s)]
*  a real debate. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3866.96s)]
*  Everybody now sees your example and knows, oh, wait, if I speak up and criticize her, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3867.6s)]
*  that's going to happen to me and I don't have the same ability that Roger Water has to [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3872.0s)]
*  protect myself from it. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3875.52s)]
*  It's a very effective means of closing debate. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3876.4s)]
*  But another one that has become increasingly popular in the West is finding all sorts of [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3879.28s)]
*  ways to censor and control the flow of information over this innovation that was supposed to be [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3884.64s)]
*  the thing that would transform and liberate us, which was the internet. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3889.6s)]
*  And there's all kinds of justifications offered for why that needs to happen. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3892.64s)]
*  There's too much hate speech. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3897.12s)]
*  It's too toxic. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3898.4s)]
*  There's a lot of disinformation and deceiving people. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3899.92s)]
*  What is your view of the claim by governments, Western governments in particular, that they need [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3904.2400000000002s)]
*  to be able to control the limits of speech and political debates in order to protect people [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3909.52s)]
*  from hate speech and disinformation? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3914.48s)]
*  It's one of the few honest things they say. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3915.36s)]
*  Is they say there's no way we could survive and do what we're doing. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3918.1600000000003s)]
*  Because they wouldn't admit this, but they are destroying the planet and they're doing [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3922.1600000000003s)]
*  it hand over fist because all of this stuff, perpetual war, for instance, is a smoke screen [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3927.04s)]
*  that's covering up the thing that we don't need wars to destroy the planet. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3932.88s)]
*  Climate change is doing it. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3936.96s)]
*  If we don't go to the bar, sit down, what would you like a half a bit of the year? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3938.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3943.6s)]
*  What are we going to do about this? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3943.84s)]
*  And try and figure some things out and that the only way that the human race can find a way [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3945.84s)]
*  of organizing things so that most people have a roof over their head and access to education [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3953.28s)]
*  and healthcare and all those things that mean a lot to all human beings is by cooperating with [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3959.12s)]
*  one another and tossing the profit motive out of the window because it doesn't belong in life with [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3965.28s)]
*  us if we're going to lead a decent life where we can have amateur theater or nobody can let, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3973.52s)]
*  nobody can live where I live now in the United States. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3981.92s)]
*  Nobody can get from paycheck to paycheck except Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and about four other [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3985.2000000000003s)]
*  oligarchs. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3991.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I know I'm exaggerating. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3992.2400000000002s)]
*  No, but it's been not. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3993.6s)]
*  But the inequality has exploded and the wealth concentration, especially with COVID, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3994.32s)]
*  got way worse than ever. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=3999.28s)]
*  But let me ask you the last question because this is what I wanted to end with anyway, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4000.48s)]
*  which was, you know, we're talking to Israel and Gaza before and this idea that the Israelis don't [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4004.7200000000003s)]
*  really pretend any longer to believe in a two-state solution. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4008.8s)]
*  And the question then becomes, well, do you have any optimism at all about how this conflict can [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4012.88s)]
*  end? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4018.6400000000003s)]
*  But I want to ask you that more broadly about all the things we've talked about, the wars and the [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4018.7200000000003s)]
*  suffering and this inequality. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4022.7200000000003s)]
*  Are you optimistic? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4024.8s)]
*  And if so, why? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4025.92s)]
*  Am I optimistic? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4029.28s)]
*  Not really. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4030.96s)]
*  But the only way that we can change this is through people power and all the people power. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4031.92s)]
*  And we are a majority. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4041.92s)]
*  There's a song in my... [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4044.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a verse in my song, The Bar, that says, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4046.48s)]
*  Come on in here, sister, and sit us, Bell. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4049.12s)]
*  You are most welcome in the bar. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4051.12s)]
*  Us helping the old homeless lady. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4053.12s)]
*  We may seem few, but we are many. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4056.48s)]
*  Have you been traveling for... [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4059.36s)]
*  And we are many. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4060.72s)]
*  But they control the media, so they control the narrative. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4062.56s)]
*  And so, so long as they've got Richard... [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4067.6s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch, rather, and a few other oligarchs telling us what we are allowed to and what we're [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4069.9199999999996s)]
*  not allowed to listen to, read and believe more, is why all this stuff about Zuckerberg and his [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4075.4399999999996s)]
*  connections and Google's connections with the Pentagon and the CIA and the meetings that they [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4087.68s)]
*  have all the time and how they're making policy are terrifying beyond all belief. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4093.12s)]
*  Because we've all read George Orwell and, you know, and so... [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4100.0s)]
*  And Truthspeak and all of that. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4106.8s)]
*  So how do we put our shoulders to that wheel and get the wheel to move even enough that we [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4110.96s)]
*  haven't just completely abrogated... [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4119.84s)]
*  Not abrogated, but got rid of our responsibility that we have as individuals to say, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4124.400000000001s)]
*  No. And human rights is the brick upon which we have to build. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4130.400000000001s)]
*  Because it's the only really sensible idea that has come since 1789 and the end of the divine [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4136.48s)]
*  right of kings. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4147.36s)]
*  They literally believed in feudal times that there was God and then the king. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4148.48s)]
*  And told the Enlightenment that's what the central belief of human rights organization was. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4153.28s)]
*  And then the clergy and then the nobles and then everybody else. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4157.679999999999s)]
*  And the everybody else, the sans-culottes, were irrelevant, completely irrelevant. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4160.96s)]
*  Well, the Enlightenment was just going, hang on a minute, this doesn't make any sense of [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4165.6s)]
*  any of the science that we actually know. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4171.68s)]
*  And so how can we define that? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4175.120000000001s)]
*  Well, you do that by saying, No, this king is actually no more important than this serf [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4179.120000000001s)]
*  in human terms. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4185.68s)]
*  And this serf needs to have exactly the same rights under the law [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4187.6s)]
*  not under God or under the king or under the nobles or under people who went to fucking eat [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4194.32s)]
*  and under the law as this guy. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4200.24s)]
*  And we don't have that. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4204.08s)]
*  And it's partly because the people who run the governments, particularly in the United States [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4205.52s)]
*  of America, refuse to subscribe to international law. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4210.0s)]
*  They are not signatories to the Treaty of Rome or the Hague or any of these things that they charge [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4213.84s)]
*  Putin with. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4220.24s)]
*  Putin with, they just don't accept the legitimacy that is applied to them. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4221.679999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4226.16s)]
*  And they pick and choose, they cherry pick all of these rights issues. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4227.44s)]
*  So that is if all of us went down the pub and went, right, Krapers, how many of you agree that you [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4231.92s)]
*  should have the same rights legally as everybody else in the world? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4239.28s)]
*  That includes all the Chinese and the Russians, by the way. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4243.599999999999s)]
*  Do you think that we should all have the same rights under universal law? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4247.04s)]
*  Yep. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4252.32s)]
*  If we could get the world and look at it and give everybody a voting slip, I bet you there'd be more [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4253.839999999999s)]
*  hands go up than stay down if you asked We the People that. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4260.24s)]
*  So we the people have to be given our voice and acknowledge that like in the United States, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4265.5199999999995s)]
*  where I live, the system, political system is completely corrupt and broken down, has nothing [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4274.4s)]
*  to do with the will of the people or democracy or anything else. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4281.839999999999s)]
*  And it's clearly at the moment, US foreign policy is run by a group of, well, there's a dotard at [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4285.44s)]
*  the top, poor Joe, I mean, he can hardly. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4292.4s)]
*  It's elder abuse, really. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4295.2s)]
*  It's awful. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4296.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4298.96s)]
*  Well, I'm happy my questions survived the relentless assault that you watched at them. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4299.6s)]
*  And actually, what I'm really most glad about having sit down and talk to you is that [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4304.88s)]
*  so often there's a caricature of people created and it works because people who believe it don't [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4309.280000000001s)]
*  really get to hear very much from or get to know the person who's being vilified and maligned. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4315.84s)]
*  And so having gotten to know you some and then getting the chance to sit down in places like [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4321.4400000000005s)]
*  this and listen to you, I wanted other people to see what I've seen. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4326.48s)]
*  And so I hope they will. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4329.919999999999s)]
*  And I'm so happy that we got to find some time to sit down and talk again. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4330.879999999999s)]
*  Well, me too. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4335.28s)]
*  I'm just going to say this one thing. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4336.24s)]
*  I wrote a radio play about 10 years ago, and it's about a small child in Northern Ireland [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4338.879999999999s)]
*  and his grandfather's babysitting. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4346.48s)]
*  Anyway, the kid has a nightmare. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4348.719999999999s)]
*  Grandfather goes in and the kid says, grandpa, they're killing the children. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4350.5599999999995s)]
*  And the grandfather says, no, no, no, that was in the trouble. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4355.360000000001s)]
*  It's that was years and years ago. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4358.24s)]
*  He said, no, grandpa, I'm not talking about here. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4359.84s)]
*  I'm talking about over there. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4363.84s)]
*  And the grandfather says, we'll go and find out. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4366.0s)]
*  And the rest of the play is about him finding out. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4368.64s)]
*  And they want the answer to this question. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4372.320000000001s)]
*  Why are they killing the children? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4375.2s)]
*  And that's the question I want answered today by these motherfuckers. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4378.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that is a question that I think is both vital and very difficult to answer. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4382.72s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4388.0s)]
*  Really appreciate talking to you. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4388.56s)]
*  All right. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsWFn6P9ILM&t=4390.240000000001s)]
